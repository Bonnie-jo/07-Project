Natalee Sesler, 25, of New Port Richey, is also accused of throwing a metal rake at her 10-month-old child, police said. She was charged with child abuse, child neglect, aggravated assault, resisting a police officer without violence and violating probation, according to WTSP-TV.

Sesler was visiting a man in the area when she allegedly threw the child into the fence. She had tossed the rake at the child as well but missed, according to the station. She then reportedly picked up the baby by the leg and threw him into a chair.

Shannon Wixon was outside with her daughter when they saw the incident.

“They came running into the house and they told me, 'There's a lady over here that just threw her baby against the wall,’” Wixon told FOX 13 News.

Wixon saw the horrifying scene unfold.

“I came out and looked behind the fence of apartment one, and that's when I'd seen the lady sitting there and her child was laying over a lawn chair, hanging upside down pretty much, screaming, crying,” Wixon said. “She was just sitting there not doing anything.”

Wixon added that Sesler shook the baby once more and “took off walking.”

Orange County man back behind bars after peeking inside teen's bedroom,"An Orange County man previously accused of peeking inside of a teenager's bedroom window is now back behind bars on new voyeurism charges.

Deputies arrested Thai Williams, 18, Friday after investigators said a neighbor's home surveillance camera caught him on video looking into a girl's bedroom while using a flashlight last Thursday and Friday morning.

The latest alleged victim did not want to be identified, but she told News 6 that Williams is her former classmate from school and his allegations are concerning.

""Not knowing exactly when or what time he was looking at me, if it was while I was getting ready, or while I didn’t have any clothes on,"" the victim said. ""I wouldn’t wish this upon anyone.""

The alleged victim told us she's still trying to recover from the scare.

""I feel uncomfortable now, myself to get ready in my room, to get ready anywhere, and I’m just very cautious about what I do now,"" she said. ""I never thought this would happen to me now, but it did, and it can happen to anyone.""

Williams faced a jail judge over the weekend in Orange County. She granted him no bond and revoked his bond based on his previous voyeurism charges earlier this year.

Court records show Williams was arrested back in February on similar allegations.

Deputies said video cameras caught Williams on at least six different occasions, from August of 2018 to February 2019, peeking inside of a different former classmate’s bedroom window in a separate Orange County neighborhood. In one case, a neighbor told deputies he saw Williams using a ladder to peek inside of the girl's bedroom, records show.

The latest alleged victim said she hopes Williams remains in jail on no bond.

""All around I hope that he gets the help that he needs because I don’t want any of this to happen again to any other girl.""

Williams remains locked up in the Orange County Jail on a new charge of voyeurism among other charges.

Neighbors identify woman found dead with dead man in Nocatee home,"NOCATEE, Fla. - Neighbors identify the woman found dead in a Nocatee home Saturday as Lynn Bender. That name matches what public records show about who lived at this home. Bender worked as a realtor for Remax. She lives one street over and she was supposed to host an open house at this home yesterday morning from 11 to 2 and when she didn't show up, that's when people started making calls.

The St. Johns County Sheriff's Office responded Saturday afternoon to investigate the suspicious deaths of a man and woman at 203 Southern Oak Drive in Nocatee.

Neighbor said their neighbor called her boss who called her family member who then came to check on her and found her and a man dead inside.

The St Johns County Sheriff's office has not released the details involving how the two died or the relationship. But the Clerk of Courts website shows Bender had filed a petition for an injunction against a man named Simon Hanley in December 2018. The injunction was filed against stalking violence.

Neighbors say they saw an odd man in the past at her home.

""She had taken out a restraining order against someone and the particular person was the one that I know now was odd and we should've cautioned her against spending time with him but she had a big heart and she couldn't help but want to help others,"" said neighbor Jane Amorim.

Neighbors say it was a rough night for them and people are torn up about this.

People are posting on facebook that she was a really sweet person and sending prayers to her loved ones.

Plantation police investigators said Fernando De Baere told them he shot Marisa Sherman, 47, because she wouldn't stop speaking disrespectfully.

Plantation police said De Baere shot her in the face, returned his .38-caliber handgun to a bedroom and then walked to a neighbor’s house to confess. The neighbor called 911.

Police said De Baere admitted to shooting his wife ""one or two times"" in the face while standing about 3 feet away from her.

De Baere was charged with murder and jailed without bond Saturday. Records did not show if he has an attorney.

Police say De Baere told them he shot his wife because he did not like the way she was talking to him during an argument. A police report says De Baere told officers exactly where to find the weapon.

Tall grass fines lead city to foreclose on home,"DUNEDIN, Fla. - It’s true, a Florida man says his grass grew a little too tall. But he doesn’t think he should lose his house over it.

The city of Dunedin moved to foreclose on the home of 69-year-old Jim Ficken over $30,000 in unpaid code violation fines. The Tampa Bay Times reports that Ficken was fined $500 a day last summer because his grass was taller than 10 inches.

Ficken filed a lawsuit against the city seeking a nominal $1 in damages, relief from fines and an end to the city’s practice of fining people without considering ability to pay.

Last summer, Ficken says he was away for lengthy periods managing the estate of his deceased mother in South Carolina. Ficken says the man paid to mow his lawn then died unexpectedly.

A toddler's Ice Age discovery: Woolly mammoth tooth found in Florida,"CLOSE A Palm Bay toddler finds a mammoth tooth next to a retention pond. Tim Shortt, FLORIDA TODAY

MELBOURNE, Fla. — A toddler stumbled upon a woolly mammoth tooth last weekend alongside a retention pond in Florida, uncovering evidence of the tusked beasts that roamed the state's coast thousands of years ago.

Monte Brigance, a retired offshore electrician from Livingston, Texas, was babysitting his grandson Colt Couch, who turns 3 on Wednesday, during the unexpected discovery in southeast Palm Bay.

""He was throwing rocks into the pond. That's his favorite thing to do: throw rocks in the pond that he picks up out of the bank. About half of this was sticking out of the soil, and he couldn't pull it up,"" Brigance said, holding the mammoth tooth.

""So I pulled it up for him and got to looking at it — and I decided that we'd better not throw it away. We'll clean it up and see what it looks like,"" he said.

""Out of all the places my wife and I have been, looking for fossils — and yet we come to Florida and go to a pond, and there it is sticking out of the ground. It was a nice little find.""

Though most people conjure mental images of woolly mammoths trudging across snow-swept Arctic tundra, Ice Age creatures were common in Florida, particularly along the Atlantic Coastal Ridge.

""Twenty thousand years ago, sea level was 400 feet lower than it is today. So the ocean shoreline was like 40 miles off the coast here. The Indian River was a lot like the St. Johns prairie today,"" said Bob Gross, past chairman of the Brevard County Historical Commission.

""You have these big grazing prairies. The mammoths were grazers, and the mastadons were browsers. You can see their teeth are totally different in their structure,"" Gross said.

""You can picture those prairies covered with bison, with mammoths and mastadons, giant ground sloths, camels, horses,"" he said.

During the Pleistocene epoch, woolly mammoth roamed the area now known as Kettle Moraine in southeastern Wisconsin. Illustration courtesy Wisconsin Dept. of Natural Resources.

Archaeologists have excavated skeletons of mammoths, mastadons and fellow Pleistocene creatures from the famed ""Melbourne bone beds.""

These deposits, which lie beneath Crane Creek Reserve Golf Course and the nearby Florida Institute of Technology, extend southward to Vero Beach.

""If you go to any sand pit that gets below the surficial geology, you can pick shark's teeth, various mammal bones. You can pick mastadon and mammoth teeth and bones,"" said Gary Zarillo, Florida Tech professor of ocean engineering and marine sciences.

""The fossilized skeletons of the large megafauna that we had here up until about 10,000 years ago: large sloths, saber-toothed cats, things like that,"" he said.

Columbian mammoths appeared in Florida about 1.5 million years ago, then vanished about 10,000 years ago because of human hunting and other factors, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville.

In 1913, the Indian River Farms Co. dredged a Vero Beach canal, revealing bones of mammoth, mastadon, giant armadillo and other extinct species. Two years later, a human skull was spotted on the canal wall.

This ""Vero Man"" discovery marked the first in the New World where human remains and artifacts were found alongside Ice Age animals, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. Researchers believe the find shows people inhabited Florida as far back as 14,000 years ago or more — much earlier than previously believed.

In Melbourne, Crane Creek and its tributaries yielded similar discoveries during the 1920s. Archaeologists Frederick Loomis of Amherst College and James Gidley of the Smithsonian Institution unearthed two complete mammoth skeletons and found the crushed skull of ""Melbourne Man,"" akin to his Vero counterpart.

One skeleton was excavated at today's Botanical Gardens on the Florida Tech campus. Today, this Melbourne mammoth looms above visitors alongside skeletons of a mastadon and Irish deer at the Beneski Museum of Natural History at Amherst College in Massachusetts.

What's more, the Division III school's athletic teams are nicknamed the Mammoths.

This mammoth skeleton was discovered during the 1920s on what is now Crane Creek Reserve Golf Course in Melbourne. It is displayed at the Beneski Museum of Natural History at Amherst College in Massachusetts. (Photo: Samuel Masinter/Amherst College)

At Florida Tech, a partial mammoth molar is displayed inside a glass showcase at Evans Library. Discovered near campus, the molar dates back more than 10,000 years.

And in Cocoa, a replica mastodon skeleton highlights the Brevard Museum of History & Natural Science. That beast's bones were cast from a mastadon found in the Aucilla River near Tallahassee.

Brigance said he initially suspected the mammoth tooth was a piece of asphalt.

“I always think it’s amazing when archaeological discoveries are made like this — especially when everyday people just kind of stumble onto items like this,” said Ben Brotemarkle, Florida Historical Society executive director.

“It’s amazing just to contemplate what it would have been like to be a human being alive at that time, when those types of huge animals were roaming around,"" Brotemarkle said.

Gwen was put on an organ transplant list last August and was warned that her age might preclude her from getting a new liver.

That's when her son, Brandon, stepped in and stepped up after researching the possibility of living organ donations, he gave a piece of his liver to save his mom's life.

""I'm not sure I have the words to describe how I feel about my son. I'm grateful that he is the kind of man that would do something like that, that he would risk his life for another human being, didn't have to be his mother, it would've been anybody,"" Gwen Finlayson said.

Man who lied about being shot now faces federal charge,"The case of a man who Ocala police said lied about how he was shot late last year has been transferred to a federal court, where he is facing a federal charged in a hearing scheduled for Tuesday.

Federal officials said Michael Guell will have a change of plea and bond revocation hearing in Ocala federal court on Tuesday at 2 p.m. in front of Magistrate Judge Philip R. Lammens.

Guell, who was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and making false report of a crime in November 2018, had posted $21,000 bond and was released within a day of his arrest. Since then, prosecutors have dropped the local charges against Guell because he was indicted federally.

The 37-year-old Spring Hill man was picked up late last week and is being held by the United States Marshal at the Marion County Jail on a federal charge of possession of a firearm affecting commerce by a convicted felon.

In November, police officers went to Florida Hospital, now Adventheath Ocala, to investigate an incident involving a man at the facility with a gunshot wound. Guell had been shot in the stomach.

Guell told police he was in town for a job and was at an unknown hotel drinking when he decided to get pizza, according to an arrest report. He said he went out and while returning to the hotel, he stopped at a gas station and someone tried to rob him.

Guell said the robber fired two shots at him when he told the assailant he did not have anything. Guell said he called an Uber to take him to the hospital.

Police say Guell’s story changed significantly when they asked him more questions. According to the report, Guell eventually told officers he was drinking in his vehicle, pulled out a handgun, and accidentally fired two shots, one of which hit his stomach.

Guell gave several reasons for lying, one of them being that he is a convicted felon. He was later transferred to Ocala Regional Medical Center for further treatment and, upon his release, was arrested.

Federal officials in their charging document said Guell has five felony convictions, to include drugs, all from New Jersey.

A search warrant was served on the vehicle and law enforcement officials recovered 26 rounds of .40-caliber ammunition, seven .40-caliber casings, a black Ruger semi-automatic handgun, two bottles of Hoppes gun oil, a gun cleaning kit with brushes and a package of shooting targets. The gun, according to ATF Special Agent Dewane Krueger, was manufactured in Arizona and therefore crossed state lines prior to it being discovered in Florida.

Florida man who stood on sunroof while driving accused of felony domestic violence,"POLK COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA ) - A driver made a lot of people laugh this week when he stood up on his sunroof with his car on cruise control while driving on Interstate 4. But the story behind the story isn't funny at all.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office said 70-year-old Leonard Olsen was arrested not only for driving recklessly, but also for false imprisonment and domestic violence by strangulation.

RELATED: Florida man arrested for hanging out sunroof while driving on I-4

According to an arrest report, Olsen is accused of choking a 69-year-old woman on April 30 after she took too long to come to bed. The woman told deputies she had bruises on her throat and a hoarse voice.

Days later, after the woman came home from dinner, he allegedly ripped up the dress she had been wearing, accused her of having an affair and called her a vulgar name. Then he asked her for one of her bras and threatened to destroy every bra in her dresser. When she eventually gave him a bra, he tore it apart and demanded that she give him the pair of underwear she had been wearing. When she told him she was still wearing the underwear, he began ""pulling on the underwear causing the victim's body to shake back and forth until the underwear came loose from the victim's body,"" an arrest report states.

Once he was through destroying all of her clothing, Olsen began blaring music so she couldn't fall asleep. This lasted several hours, according to the victim.

The next day, the victim awoke to Olsen slamming dresser drawers, turning the lights on and off, and blaring music. Deputies said he pushed her onto their bed, straddled her and put his hand on her throat, then placed his thumb on her mouth, which she bit. Olsen got off of her and blocked the doorway to prevent her from leaving the room. After a few minutes, he let her pass through the doorway and she called 911.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office said detectives made contact with Olsen by phone on Tuesday and he agreed to turn himself in.

As deputies were on their way to meet him, they learned he had been pulled over by the Florida Highway Patrol for driving recklessly.

Olsen was arrested and booked into the South County Jail, where he faces three counts of felony domestic battery on a person 65 or older, one count of felony false imprisonment and one count of felony domestic battery by strangulation.",http://www.wfla.com/news/polk-county/lakeland-man-who-stood-on-sunroof-while-driving-accused-of-felony-domestic-violence/1997065259,2019-05-12T03:59:05Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"
Man charged in fatal shooting outside nightclub extradited to Orlando,"ORLANDO, Fla. - The extradition of a man charged with the death of a 22-year-old man at a downtown Orlando nightclub in January has brought a sense of relief for the family of the victim.

Notier Misael Gomez, 27, is charged with first-degree murder with a firearm and attempted first-degree murder with a firearm in connection with the death of Keveon Smith.

Surveillance video from the morning of Jan. 26 showed Smith in the parking lot of Club Lit with a group of people.

The video showed a man walking up to Smith and hitting him on the head and then three men shooting toward him as he tried to run away.

Smith died at an area hospital. Two other people suffered injuries as a result of the shooting, according to Orlando police.

The Rev. James Morris is the pastor for the family and a friend. He continues to check in with Smith's parents since his death.

""When I talked to Keveon's mom, she says, 'Isn't this something? It's the day before Mother's Day,' and I said, 'It is something,'"" Morris said.

After months of investigation, federal agents tracked down Gomez in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, in April. He was extradited to Orlando on Friday.

""That arrest and that extradition says we are not going to let this die. This will not be another cold case file,"" Morris said.

Morris said the fight isn't over. Three people were seen shooting in the surveillance video, but there's only been one arrest.

""This should say to people, time out for it, because we're going to get you,"" Smith said.

Gomez went before a judge Saturday morning and was given no bond.

Officials have not said what role Gomez allegedly played in the shooting or if additional suspects are being sought.

Florida man says he would rather 'go to jail' than to his wife as he gets caught driving on sunroof,"A Florida man claiming he would rather “go to jail” than back home to his wife was arrested Friday after being caught driving on a highway while sitting on top of his sunroof.

Leonard Olsen, 70, was detained after an off-duty deputy at Hillsborough County sheriff's office recorded the man and reported him to the Florida Highway Patrol.

FLORIDA MAN WHO WAS ARRESTED FOR REFUSING TO REMOVE VULGAR STICKER HAS CHARGES DROPPED

The deputy said Olsen was speeding more than 100 mph down the highway and later slowed down to 40 mph, WTSP reported. The man then stood up and sat on his open sunroof while the car was still moving.

After being stopped by troopers, Olsen initially denied that he was traveling on his sunroof, saying he didn’t “know about that.”

But the man then told the authorities that he actually wanted to turn himself in, according to the outlet citing law enforcement officials, because he didn’t want to go back home to his wife, who he says does not treat him well.

Olsen told police that his “wife treats me like a servant and she's the mistress” and that he’s “tired of this s---.” The man added that he would rather “go to jail than go back home.”

His wish was granted and Olsen was arrested. After showing the video of him on the sunroof, he admitted his guilt and noted that the car was on cruise control, according to WTSP.

“The car drives itself and has a gigantic computer in it,” Olsen said. “I thought it would be a nice way to praise God for a minute, and I thought it would be nice at the time and that's what I did.”

Florida agency investigates after man shoos raccoon off boat,"TAMPA, Fla. - A Florida agency is investigating potential animal cruelty charges after a lawyer posted video of himself shooing a raccoon off his boat into the Gulf of Mexico.

The Tampa Bay Times reports that Clearwater attorney Thomas Cope posted the video to Facebook, later issuing an apology for his actions and saying he wished he could have returned the animal to shore. Cope says the boat was about 20 miles (32 kilometers) out in the Gulf when the raccoon appeared growling and hissing.

The video also includes a man's voice yelling at the raccoon and saying, ""So long, sucker.""

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said in a statement it learned of the video May 8 and began an investigation. The statement mentions that ""these vile acts of animal cruelty"" are intolerable.

Man in child porn case who claimed brain damage from West Nile made him sexually aggressive sentenced,"A Texas man received the maximum sentence for child pornography Thursday after initially blaming West Nile virus for his actions.

Irving Jose Marquez, 30, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and a lifetime of supervised release after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of receipt and distribution of a visual depiction involving sexual exploitation of a minor, the El Paso Times reported. He pleaded guilty to the charge in August.

CALIFORNIA MAN WHO FAKED SUICIDE TO AVOID CHILD ABUSE CHARGES FOUND IN FLORIDA NEARLY 3 YEARS LATER

A charge of possession of visual depiction involving the sexual exploitation of a minor under 12 was dismissed as part of his plea deal, the newspaper reported. Marquez’s lawyer had asked the judge to give his client the minimum sentence of five years, but the judge declined.

Marquez’s lawyer John Calhoun, had argued that he had contracted the West Nile virus in 2009 and the brain damage he received from it made him sexually aggressive.

“It wasn’t him who did it, he didn’t ask for West Nile,” Calhoun told the judge during the sentencing, according to the newspaper. “Because of the mental and emotional conditions of Mr. Marquez, he deserves a variance of the 20 years …The government is asking for 20 years, we are asking for five years and extensive supervised release.”

A judge argued that the sentence was what’s needed to “protect the public.”

U.S. Homeland Security investigators were tipped off in 2017 about possible child pornography on a Flickr account under Marquez’s name. Investigators found hundreds of illicit images and videos of young girls he knew on multiple electronic devices owned by Marquez, according to El Paso Times.

Prosecutors said Marquez was “entirely responsible” for setting up a camera at a mall restroom.

In addition to his prison term, Marquez was ordered to pay $3,200 to the victims.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-man-who-claimed-west-nile-virus-game-him-brain-damage-gets-20-years-on-child-porn-charges-report,2019-05-13T05:51:13Z,Fox News,"1211 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10036"
"Man killed, at least 2 hurt in shootings near Trump Miami resort","A man was killed and at least two other people were injured Sunday in a pair of shootings near a South Florida resort bearing President Trump's name.

The Miami Herald reported that 43-year-old Mohammad Jradi was killed in the shooting that unfolded around 1:30 p.m. near the Trump International Beach Resort Miami in Sunny Isles Beach, just north of Miami Beach. A 5-year-old child was grazed by a bullet.

Witnesses told the paper that a woman also was shot after a fight broke out in front of the Trump building. The witnesses identified the woman who was shot as Kay Marie, the girlfriend of rapper NBA YoungBoy. The rapper was scheduled to perform Sunday night as part of the Rolling Loud hip-hop festival at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.

In addition, police were investigating a second shooting on a nearby causeway linking Sunny Isles Beach and Aventura in which one person suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Aventura police said they were working with Sunny Isles Beach Police and Miami-Dade police to determine whether the two shootings were related.

Man o' war sightings reported on St. Johns County beaches,"0 Man o' war sightings reported on St. Johns County beaches

A trip to the beach on Mothers Day is a tradition for many families in Jacksonville.

Atlantic Beach mom Tracy Fout came out with her three children.

“They’re all little mermaids,” she said. “This is our go-to spot on Mothers Day.”

Some moms kept a close eye on their kids Sunday as more people reported seeing Man o’ war jellyfish in St. Johns County.

The blue creatures with long tentacles were reported from Vilano Beach down to Marineland.

“I’ve been stung by one before and it hurts pretty bad,” Jacksonville dad John Dinkins said. “It’s basically like you’re being electrocuted.”

No Man o' war sightings were reported in Duval, but families sent Action News Jax photos of another blue organism spotted at Jacksonville and Atlantic beaches.

We showed Max Ervanian with Jacksonville Beach Ocean Rescue. He said they appeared to be Porpita porpita. Known as “blue buttons,” they are small creatures similar to jellyfish.

He said Jax Beach hasn’t seen many jellyfish stings this week, and he doesn’t expect a spike in Man o' war sightings right now.

“The winds and the current are pushing the Man o’ war and the jellyfish away from the shore,” he said.

Ervanian says if you do see jellyfish, don’t touch them and see a lifeguard immediately if you're stung.

""It's just part of going to the beach, you know?"" Fout said. ""My kids know to avoid the jellyfish at all costs. ""If we see them in the water, we just don’t go in.""

AOC says she was ‘astonished' when man left sign outside her office in support of both her and Trump,"- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said a man left a sign outside her office on Friday that expressed support for both her and President Trump, a concept she said left her feeling “pretty astonished.”

The freshman lawmaker detailed the experience on Twitter, explaining that upon leaving work for the day, she discovered a man and a person she presumed to be his teenage son putting up a handmade sign outside her office.

It read: “Trump supporters for Ocasio-Cortez.”

About an hour ago, I was walking out of my office for the day.



There was a man what I believe was his teenage son hanging a small sign they made outside my office (we let people leave well wishes on our wall).



Astonishingly, his sign read: “Trump supporters for Ocasio-Cortez.” pic.twitter.com/IjVKbvetEI — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 10, 2019





The pair exchanged introductions and the man told her that “he wanted to show his support,” Ocasio-Cortez said. She was left struggling on how to ask him for an explanation, she said.

“I somehow got it out: ‘With all respect sir, how do you... manage to support both of us at the same time?’” Ocasio-Cortez said she asked. “This is what he said: ‘I’ve been saying for years that climate change is our most important crisis. You’re one of the only ones who‘s been willing to be decisive on it.’”

I was pretty astonished.



We shook hands, he introduced himself, and told me he wanted to show his support.



I could barely get my question out - I wanted to honor his positivity, yet respectfully find a way to ask, “How?” — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 10, 2019





“Then he said, ‘I like you. I can tell that you are genuine and fighting for us. You’re real and you get it.’ I thanked him and his family from the bottom of my heart,” she continued.

Since entering the political sphere, Ocasio-Cortez has been a champion for the Green New Deal, an economic stimulus concept designed to tackle income inequality and climate change.

Ocasio-Cortez chose to share her experience Friday as a means to spread a message of perseverance, she said, before accusing politicians and lobbyists of thwarting efforts to fix “our climate crisis.”

Then he said, “I like you. I can tell that you are genuine and fighting for us. You’re real and you get it.”



I thanked him and his family from the bottom of my heart. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 10, 2019





“All of this is to say don’t let any politician, no matter the party, lecture you about what is ‘possible’ or ‘electable,’” she tweeted. “Don’t ever let a politician imply that working people are ‘less-than’ or ‘uneducated’ - aka that they are the ones in the way of solving the climate crisis.”

The forces getting in the way of solving our climate crisis are politicians themselves + lobbyists. It is the willingness to bend to corporate power - the same ones that use coal miners’ plights for a tax break, yet refuse to pay for those same miners’ healthcare for black lung. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 10, 2019





She went on to encourage her followers to vote in line with their personal “values.”

“If you don’t understand this man’s sign - or don’t approach it with a desire to - then you do not understand this political moment,” she tweeted. “The same folks who said Trump was impossible in 2016 are the same ones lecturing on what’s ‘electable’ in 2020. Don’t buy it. Vote your values.”

It was unclear Sunday night whether foul play was involved in the death of an individual whose body was found in a pond in eastern Leon County.

The body, which has not yet been identified, was discovered at about 1:30 p.m. in a pond on Peacock Lane, just north of Interstate 10 off Baum Road.

Leon County Sheriff's Office Deputy Mike Wallace said investigators were working to determine the gender of the body found, but he believed it may be a man.

Rainy weather and the location of the body were frustrating identification efforts, and it was still too soon to say whether the death was suspicious.

Ficken filed a lawsuit against the city seeking a nominal $1 in damages, relief from fines and an end to the city's practice of fining people without considering ability to pay.

Last summer, Ficken said he was away for lengthy periods managing the estate of his deceased mother in South Carolina.

"Man who died in Saturday plane crash in East Naples was Marco resident, 71, experienced pilot","The pilot killed in the small-airplane crash Saturday in East Naples was a Marco Island resident.

Bill Gaston Sr., 71, of Marco Island, died Saturday when the airplane he was piloting crashed in East Naples. (Photo: Submitted)

Bill Gaston Sr., 71, died piloting a twin-engine plane from Key West. He was on his way to the Naples Airport. The scheduled hourlong flight ended just 5 miles from the airport, when the airplane crashed near a home in the 4900 block of Hawthorn Woods Way.

The plane was following the planned flight path until the final runway approach, according to flight-tracking website flightaware.com.

His son, Bill Gaston Jr., said his father had plenty of flight experience.

“He’s been a pilot since he was 16,” Gaston Jr. said. “He’s got plenty of flight hours.”

The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the crash investigation and had not released any information from it by mid-afternoon Sunday. However, Gaston Jr. said a medical crisis could have caused the crash.

“As another pilot, I would say it was health-related, based on how it crashed,” he said.

Gaston Jr. said his father was in good health and had regular checkups.

The plane, a 1964 Piper Twin Comanche, passed its yearly inspection, Gaston Jr. said.

Gaston Jr. said his father was in communication with air traffic controllers throughout the flight. No distress call was made, Gaston Jr. said. The airplane went down in a wooded area just east of Santa Barbara Boulevard and just south of Pine Ridge Road.

The plane was severely damaged in the crash, said Jamie Mosbach, a spokeswoman for the Collier County Sheriff’s Office.

No agency has stated whether another passenger was aboard, but Gaston Jr. does not think anyone else was on the flight.

His father regularly took friends and relatives on trips to Key West and the Bahamas.

After selling his business, Marco Island Cable, to Summit Broadband in 2013, Gaston Sr. spent much of his time boating and flying. He flew for 45 years.

“He was doing what he loved,” Gaston Jr. said.

Gaston Sr. had lived on Marco Island since 1984.

WATCH: Man scares off would-be burglars by firing shots,"(WFLA) - An unlawful entry into a man's home ended badly for four would-be burglars in Kentucky, WBKO reported.

The Warren County Sheriff's Office released video of the intrusion on their Facebook page.

Deputies said 24-year-old Austin Orwig was inside of the home when four men entered through the front door.

A video shows Orwig fire several shots at the suspect before they ran back outside.

Man who reported girl missing arrested in her disappearance,"HOUSTON - The man who reported a 4-year-old Texas girl had been abducted from him last weekend was arrested near Houston Saturday and police say they have found blood in his apartment linked to the girl.



Darion Vence was arrested without incident at his brother's home in Sugar Land, Texas, about 22 miles (35 kilometers) southwest of Houston, a statement from Houston police said. He was charged with tampering with evidence.



Vence told police last Saturday that men in a pickup truck abducted him, 4-year-old Maleah Davis and his 2-year-old son before freeing him and the boy. But Sugar Land police, who initially interviewed him, said his story kept changing and didn't add up.



Houston police said Saturday that some details of his story turned out to be false. Vence reported his silver Nissan Altima was taken in the abduction but surveillance video showed that vehicle was used to drop Vence off later at a hospital, where he reported the abduction, police said.



""Blood evidence obtained from Vence's apartment has been linked to Maleah,"" the Houston police statement said.



Vence also was observed carrying a full laundry basket from the apartment, police said. That basket was later found in the trunk of the Nissan along with a gas can.



Maleah's mother Brittany Bowens, said Vence is her former fiance. Bowens appeared outside her apartment Friday as Quanell X, a local civil rights activist, addressed reporters on her behalf.



Quanell X said that Vence had abused Maleah and that Bowens believes Vence harmed the girl.



Vence and Bowens were recently in a fight and she broke off their engagement, Quanell X said.



Child Protective Services removed Maleah and her brothers from the home Vence and Bowens shared in August after the girl suffered a head wound, but the children were returned in February, according to an agency spokeswoman.

NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (WFLA) - A judge set bond at $100,000 for a man accused of asking two teen girls to perform sex acts on him.

Matthew Marston of Holiday went before Circuit Judge Kimberly Sharpe Byrd Saturday morning. He appeared via closed-circuit television.

""Are you Matthew Marston?"" the judge asked.

""Yes, ma'am,"" he said.

Marston is charged with two counts of lewd and lascivious contact with a victim under 16.

During the brief appearance, Marston attempted to discuss his arrest.

""I just want to know how I'm getting the charges,"" he said before the judge advised him not to speak. His public defender jumped in and shut him down.

""Hold on. There it is. Your attorney is asking you not to speak,"" the judge said.

Marston was ordered to refrain from contact, either directly or indirectly, with the victims.

The scary incident happened earlier in the week along Ironware Drive in Holiday, Pasco County Sheriff's Office deputies said.

The girls told detectives the man pulled up next to them in a silver car, said inappropriate things to them and then took off.

Home surveillance video caught the encounter.

"Florida girl screams, runs for help as car follows her home","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. (WESH)— An emotional mother shared the details of a frightening moment involving her child.

She said her middle school daughter was followed home from school on Thursday and approached by a man in a car with a camera.

That student and her family spoke exclusively with WESH 2's Kelsi Thorud about what they said was a situation that could have ended much differently.

""It's just shocking because if I didn't do (anything), if I didn't run or anything, he probably would have gotten out of the car and probably grabbed me,"" the young girl said.

The sixth-grade student, who does not wish to be identified by WESH 2 News, said she was walking home from Freedom Middle School Thursday afternoon when she noticed a man in a black car.

""He's like, old looking, and he has a camera in his hand and he's smiling at me and telling, with his finger, telling me to come here,"" she said.

The girl said she immediately felt uncomfortable, so she started running.

""I run and he's still following me, and when he's still following me, I'm about over there, and I'm running and crying and screaming, 'Help me,' so someone could come and stuff,"" the child said.

Part of it was caught on surveillance video from the apartment complex the girl lives in.

In the video, the child is seen running to the gate, and a black car is seen pulling in right behind her.

""I could sense my daughter was scared by the way she was running. I've never seen her run like that before,"" the girl's mother said.

The girl's mother said she truly believes the man in the car wanted to take her daughter.

""It's a parent's worst nightmare to see something like that, and to know that there's people out there watching children like that, to try to take them or do whatever they want to do with them,"" she said.

The family said they've filed a police report and now they just want to warn parents in the area.

""Talk to your kids. Let them know stuff like this can happen. You may not think it can or will, but it does happen,"" the child's mother said.

<p>Deputies were called to 203 Southern Oak Drive, in The Palms at Nocatee neighborhood near Twenty Mile Park.</p>

<p>Detectives said the man and woman were found dead by a family member and friend around noon on Saturday. They went to check on the woman after not hearing from her. </p>

<p>It's unclear what the relationship was between the man and woman. St. Johns County Sheriff's Office spokesman Chuck Mulligan said it appears the bodies may have been in the home for a while.</p>

<p>""There doesn't appear to be any threat to the community here, that's a positive, but on the negative, we have two deceased individuals and that's never good no matter what the circumstances are,"" Mulligan said. ""We haven't released any evidence of what we found in the house at this point and time, but detectives were able to say that it was not a natural death.""     </p>

<p>""It's heartbreaking. I'm heartbroken for her. I'm really dumbfounded and can't really process it,"" neighbor Jane Amorim said.  </p>

<p>""(It's) just the car that parked there for just a little bit too long, and I kind of feel neglectful for not having paid more attention to the car and you ignore it. I realize now, it was odd,"" Amorim said.</p>

<p>An autopsy could be done as soon as Monday.</p>

<p>""She was very outgoing, willing to share and wanting to integrate into our little community,"" said neighbor Nicholas Romano.</p>

<p>Neighbors said the woman was a real estate agent. They said she was sweet and new to the community. They said she would walk her dog in the neighborhood and Amorim said they bonded over their dogs.</p>

Florida man stands through sunroof while driving down I-4,"- A Florida man has been charged with reckless driving after he was spotted standing through an opened sunroof of a moving vehicle, as it was traveling down Interstate 4.

The incident, which happened in Polk County, was captured on video by an off-duty sheriff's deputy. That witness notified authorities to be on the lookout for a white Cadillac.

A trooper with the Florida Highway Patrol spotted the Cadillac on U.S. Highway 98 and conducted a traffic stop. The driver, identified as 70-year-old Leonard Olsen, Jr., of Lakeland, was taken into custody after admitting it was him standing through the sunroof of his vehicle while the cruise control was activated.

In a report, FHP Trooper Ricky Binet wrote, ""Mr. Olsen stated that he wanted to turn himself in to an 'official' and asked if he could turn himself in to me. When asked 'Why do you want to do that?' Mr. Olsen stated 'My wife treats me like a servant and she's the mistress and I'm tired of this [explitive].'""

The report goes on to state that Olsen told the trooper, ""Lock me up, I'd rather go to jail [than] go back home.'""

(Reuters) - A Connecticut man has been indicted after prosecutors say he threatened to kill U.S. President Donald Trump and sent others bomb threats and mail containing suspicious white powder, according to court documents.

Gary Gravelle, 51, was indicted on 16 counts, including that he threatened the president in September 2018 by sending an envelope containing white powder and the handwritten message “You Die.”

He sent similar envelopes to a synagogue, a mosque and a chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), according to the indictment.

The note claimed the power was a biotoxin but it was found to be harmless, officials said.

Gravelle also sent emails and made phone calls threatening to detonate bombs in Vermont, Washington and at various locations in Connecticut, including government buildings and a mental health facility.

If convicted of all 16 counts, he could face a maximum prison sentence of 140 years.

Gravelle was previously sentenced in 2013 for sending threatening communications and had been released under federal supervision until his arrest on the new charges last year, according to U.S. Attorney John Durham’s statement on Friday.

"Despite rhetoric, guns won't be in many classrooms | Bill Cotterell","Now that Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed the new “guns in classrooms” legislation that state legislators so hotly debated this year, you know what’s going to change?

Not much.

There’s something about guns that triggers hyperbole on both sides. Judging from debate by opponents, and several social-media posts in the past week, you’d think Dirty Harry is going to be calling the roll in homeroom while Rambo patrols the playground of your local school.

Conservatives seem to think having more weaponry will make students safer, that the next evil, insane misfit with an AR-15 will be deterred by knowing the English Lit teacher just might have a pistol in her purse. Liberals, meanwhile, seem to believe counselling and mental health services can somehow paper over the damage inflicted by broken families and – well, by whatever else makes angry, armed lunatics behave like angry, armed lunatics.

Perhaps the hysteria is understandable, when guns are involved.

We saw it 30 years ago, when Florida passed its “concealed carry” legislation, allowing law-abiding citizens to get licenses and have guns holstered under a coat, or perhaps in a pocket. During prolonged, emotional debate in the House and Senate, opponents warned that Florida would turn into the wild west, with minor traffic accidents or barroom quarrels turning into street-corner shootouts.

The conservatives, who prevailed in that debate and most since then, contended that what matters is who carries a gun — not how they carry it. And pro-gun legislators also predicted we might all be a bit safer, if aggressors suspected that a potential victim might be armed.

Another reasonable explanation for the heated hyperbole is, this is Florida. Other states passed “concealed carry” laws and hardly anyone noticed. But, as our tourism slogan said at the time, “The rules are different here.” When Florida started issuing concealed weapon-permits, late-night comics did jokes about it. Sports Illustrated even headlined a cover story on the FSU-Miami football game, “Shootout in the Gunshine State.”

Well, that’s Florida for you — that’s why “Florida Man” is a whole separate category for quirky news stories.

In 2005, there were the same kind of disaster predictions and national news alarm when the Legislature enacted the “stand your ground” law. That’s the one saying you don’t have to seek safety or try to escape a dangerous confrontation, but can use force — up to and including lethal force – in self-defense.

The law has been abused. State attorneys have complained that shooters can get off with highly questionable claims of self-defense, maybe a mistaken perception of danger in a panicked instant. But repeated attempts at repealing “stand your ground” have gone nowhere in the Legislature.

The political results have borne out the pro-gun stance. Few, if any, legislators lose their seats in the House or Senate for aggressively proclaiming eternal fealty to the Second Amendment. Rather, accusing your opponent of being soft on gun control is a safe strategy in most districts.

But, really, have you changed your behavior because of any new firearms laws in Florida? Are you afraid to go out because your once tranquil neighborhood is turning into the O.K. Corral?

The legislation allowing some teachers to be armed was a shock to the senses. Nobody likes the idea. It is horribly sad to think that, on top of everything else we expect of them, some of your kid’s teachers might be asked to take on the truly awesome responsibility of a life-or-death decision in an emergency.

But they don’t have to. In fact, some who might be willing will be rejected from the “guardian” designation.

The authorization is voluntary. No teacher will be issued a gun and ordered to start taking marksmanship training.

Whole school districts can opt out, as some counties have already indicated they will do when the law takes effect Oct. 1. Teacher volunteers who are chosen for guardian status will be screened and required to take firearms-safety training.

Is that enough? No, of course not — certainly not when children are concerned. But neither is looking at only the mental-health side of the situation and hoping the unthinkable won’t happen.

Nobody will be celebrating guns in the classroom next fall. But, despite all the alarming arguments heard in the legislative session, and the week since it adjourned, the new law is not really going to change much.

A Florida radio station is in the news again thanks to a controversial contest.

For the second year in a row, Fort Myers's 103.9 is giving away a round of in vitro fertilization for a couple struggling with infertility.

The man behind the giveaway, host Jason “Big Mama” Jones told Fox 4 News last year that he and his wife came up with the idea after turning to IVF.

""I know the struggle so I know it was going to change someone's life,"" said Sara Jones, Big Mama's wife.

“And we realized one in eight people struggle with infertility and we said, ‘Hey, let’s make a miracle happen,'"" Big Mama added.

The radio station has partnered with IVFMD in Naples and S.M.P. pharmacies to make the contest happen.

"Drunken boater crashes into navigation light in Florida Keys, officials say","KEY WEST, Fla. - A Key West man was arrested Friday after authorities said he was drunk and crashed his boat into a navigation light off the coast of Fleming Key.

Two of his passengers were hurt in the collision and a third was thrown overboard and was later recovered, the U.S. Coast said.

Kevin Scott Lancaster, 50, faces charges of boating under the influence and causing property damage.

The Coast Guard said Lancaster’s 20-foot center console boat collided with the Garrison Bight Channel Light No. 3 around 8 p.m. Friday. Coast Guard personnel took Lancaster’s vessel to shore. His five other passengers were not hurt.

Lancaster was cited by the Coast Guard for boating under the influence, gross negligence and having an inadequate number of life jackets. Agents with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission took him into custody.

Paramedics airlifted the people who were hurt to a local hospital. Their conditions were not disclosed.

""Boating under the influence is just as deadly as driving under the influence,"" said Petty Officer 1st Class Ryan Andzelik, a Coast Guard Sector Key West watchstander. ""The Coast Guard will not tolerate putting yourselves and others in danger on the water. You wouldn't get in your vehicle intoxicated. Don't get in your boat intoxicated.""

Kevin Lancaster was arrested late Friday.

WATCH: Florida man arrested for hanging out sunroof while driving on highway,"LAKELAND, Fla. (WFLA) - A Florida man is facing a reckless driving charge after an off-duty deputy caught him hanging out of his sunroof while driving on I-4.

"Holt man arrested on multiple charges, including impersonating a firefighter","OKALOOSA CO., Fla. (WKRG) - A Holt man faces multiple charges.

According to a post on the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office Facebook page:

A Holt man posing as a firefighter unlawfully used a personal radio to contact the Okaloosa County Communications Center, requesting deputies to respond to a fight in Destin.

29-year old Justin Jackson is now charged with impersonation of a firefighter, unauthorized transmissions to an interference with governmental and associated radio frequencies, and unlawfully transporting radio equipment using assigned frequency of law enforcement officers.

When the radio call came in around 2 a.m. April 13th and the dispatcher asked for his unit identification, Jackson replied “Off Duty F.D.”

Jackson told deputies he was acting in the capacity of a ride sharing driver but had his radio from the Holt Fire Department in his possession. He claimed it had OCSO law enforcement frequencies placed on it by his department, but later admitted he purchased it on eBay with his own funds. A Supervisor noted that Jackson had what appeared to be emergency strobe lights on his dash board and a firefighter tag on the vehicle.

His investigation revealed Jackson is not affiliated with the Holt Volunteer Fire Department and is not a certified firefighter in the state of Florida.

A search of Jackson’ radio also revealed it had additional law enforcement and School District frequencies. --OCSO FB Page",http://www.wkrg.com/news/northwest-florida/holt-man-arrested-on-multiple-charges-including-impersonating-a-firefighter/1996168573,2019-05-11T09:41:34Z,WKRG,"555 Broadcast Dr, Mobile, AL 36606, USA"

"Fugitive wanted on child porn charges caught in Jamaica, FBI says","MIAMI — For nearly six years, Stanley Simms, who was wanted on charges related to possessing and distributing child pornography, managed to elude federal authorities.

That was until last week, when authorities caught up with the fugitive in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, the FBI said May 9.

Sims, 53, who was born in New York and lived in Sunrise since the early 1990s, was deported back to the United States by the U.S. Marshals Service. On Thursday he made his first appearance in a Miami federal court and is set to have a detention hearing this week.

Simms first came to the attention of FBI special agent Daniel Johns on Sept. 26, 2012, when he was flagged to a computer on a file-sharing network that had 15 files of suspected child pornography images and videos. The files carried names such as “real dad & toddler daughter sex” and “hussyfan my step daughter” and “chavito teniendo sexo con su amiga” (Chavito having sex with her friend), according to the criminal complaint from June 7, 2013.

Over the next two days, Johns, the complaint says, downloaded nine files that showed, among other things, a grown man “lying on top of a prepubescent female child and engaging in sexual intercourse”; a naked girl under the age of 12 performing oral sex on a grown man, then holding a gun to her own head while in a bed; and a naked girl under 12 being fondled by an adult male.

The internet provider address traced back to an account registered to Simms’ brother, who owned the East Aragon Boulevard house in Sunrise where Simms lived. The same went for a second IP address from which special agent Jason Ginther downloaded 12 files of similar content on Feb. 28, 2013, and March 4.

A database kept by law enforcement of IP addresses of people suspected of sharing child pornography files said the first address was associated with 85 “unique files of interest.” The second address was linked to 145 such files.

While the house belonged to Simms’ brother, the green 2005 BMW that FBI agents saw parked in the garage was registered to Stanley Simms. And Stanley Simms was the only one at home when the FBI swept in with a search warrant at 6:42 a.m. on June 7, 2013.

Simms said he used the file-sharing program to download movies and pornography, the latter by the batch. Then, he told agents, he’d delete the files he didn’t want. He said he’d “accidentally” downloaded child pornography in some batches and, when he did, “he usually deleted it and that he had recently deleted some files.”

But “when asked if agents would find files depicting child pornography on his computer, Simms stated that he did not want to say anything that would get him in trouble, that he had been downloading pornography regularly for years and ‘whatever it is, it is.’ “

What it was, the complaint said: a home-built computer with the file-sharing program with registry search terms such as “12y,” “Hussy,” “dad,” “mom bath,” “daughter” and “incest.” Also, there was an eight GB thumb drive on a red lanyard in Simms’ bedroom that had at least four child pornography videos.

After the warrant for his arrest, Simms disappeared. The FBI issued a “wanted poster” saying Simms would “frequent adult entertainment clubs in South Florida, particularly in Broward County, and he has reportedly operated an escort business.”

The poster also said Simms had “ties to Jamaica and (was) known to travel there. Also, Simms has been known to travel to the Bahamas.”

In addition to the child pornography charges, the poster said Simms was wanted for questioning related to multiple sexual assaults of adult females who were possibly drugged in South Florida around December 2012.",https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20190512/fugitive-wanted-on-child-porn-charges-caught-in-jamaica-fbi-says?rssfeed=true,2019-05-12T21:31:17Z,Tuscaloosa News,"3rd St, Tuscaloosa, AL 35401, USA"

HOUSTON (AP) — Houston police say they found “blood evidence” in the apartment of Darion Vence that matches that of the missing 4-year-old girl, Maleah Davis.

In a statement on the arrest of Vence, Houston police say that he has been charged with tampering with evidence.

They also say that Vence was observed carrying a full laundry basket from the apartment.

The laundry basket was found in the trunk of Vence’s silver Nisson Altima, which was recovered in Missouri City, Texas, Thursday.

Vence reported last Saturday that Maleah had been abducted from him.

The man who reported a 4-year-old Texas girl had been abducted from him last weekend has been arrested near Houston.

U.S. Marshals’ southern district spokesman Alfredo Perez says that Darion Vence was taken into custody Saturday at his brother’s house in Sugar Land, Texas, about 22 miles (35 kilometers) southwest of Houston.

Perez says the Houston Police Department requested U.S. Marshals assist in serving the arrest warrant. It was not immediately known if the arrest was related to the disappearance of Maleah Davis. Houston police could not be reached for comment.

Vence told police last Saturday that men in a pickup truck abducted him, Maleah and his 2-year-old son before freeing him and the boy.

"Not-so-fantastic 4 of Florida men wore makeup, wigs for jewelry store robberies","MIAMI — Four felons from Broward County have been convicted in federal court of jewelry store robberies from South Florida to Georgia that sound like scenes out of a Tyler Perry movie.

Christopher Brinson, Adrian Hardy, Emmory Moore and Jerome Simmons chose attire for each robbery’s gunmen that was less “Going in Style” than “Madea Goes to Jail.” They didn’t wear dresses, but did don wigs, slapped on makeup and wore women’s clothes, such as pink jumpsuits.

Alas, the four veterans of the Florida Department of Corrections proved no more skilled than they were stylish.

When they left one robbery, Moore left behind his cellphone, which was not only connected to a phone number on his account, but had the jewelry store’s name and number listed among the contacts. Brinson’s phone contained a photo of three of them next to a silver minivan rented and used in one of the robberies — a silver minivan with a SunPass that made the vehicle easily trackable.

While skedaddling from the last heist, they dropped a bag with over $1 million of jewelry.

The Justice Department used the Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative, which led to an armed robber getting 92 years and a man getting 32 years for over 20 armed robberies, to make federal cases out of the interstate run of robberies.

According to the criminal complaints, on March 3, 2017, Brinson walked into Class Jewelers located at 3756 W. Hillsboro Blvd. in Deerfield Beach and asked about selling a ring. Not long after Brinson’s visit, at around 2 p.m., surveillance cameras spotted two men dressed as women with long, dark wigs come in and rob the store at gunpoint. Employees didn’t identify the robbers dressed as women, but did easily identify advance scout Brinson.

The same thing happened March 16, 2017, at Lilli’s Jewelry Store in Spring Hill, an area north of Tampa. But as the two men-dressed-as-women left with $10,000 of jewelry and hopped in a silver minivan, Moore left behind his cell phone.

That whoopsy allowed cops to see text messages to and from Moore discussing “licks,” current slang for money quickly acquired by robbery; an internet history that included searches for Lilli’s and “jewelry store robbery in Hillsboro” (criminals tend to like to see what the media has to say about their crimes).

On April 1, two men and a woman, “all three … wearing long, dark-colored wigs, long-sleeved dark-colored shirts and long, dark-colored pants” and “light makeup” hit Bishops Jewelers in Valdosta, Georgia. Before the robbery, a man called the store to ask if the male employee was there yet. He was told the male employee would be there in an hour. A similar call preceded the robbery at Lilli’s.

Moore was arrested on April 6, 2017, for being a felon in possession of a firearm while, an arrest report says, he drove around in an unregistered car with illegally dark tints on the windows while smoking marijuana.

Hardy, Simmons and Brinson showed up at LSO Jewelry and Repair in Port St. Lucie at 9:05 a.m. April 13, 2017, “wearing heavy facial makeup and women’s clothing.”

Hardy: “dark-colored pants, a dark, long-sleeved top with a bright multi-colored shirt underneath, sunglasses, and long, dark-haired wig.

Simmons: “a women’s pink jumpsuit with a dark-colored wig.”

Brinson: “green pants, a light blue, long-sleeved top and a dark-colored wig.”

Perhaps the most eye-catching part of their ensembles, at least to the LSO employees: “Each also wore black gloves and brandished a firearm.”

When an LSO employee identified as “L.O.” asked Simmons if she could help him, Simmons said in a masculine voice, “I’m looking for an engagement ring.”

Hardy and Brinson locked the front door, then Hardy and Simmons marched L.O. and co-worker “N.N.” to the backroom at gunpoint. While they lay on their stomachs with faces down, the three criminals took what they wanted from the safe and display cases. An outside man told them through a walkie-talkie they were “good on time.”

Simmons relieved L.O. of a silver diamond and ruby Rolex. Then, suddenly, the inside trio wasn’t good on time. An off-duty cop saw the three enter the store and seemingly lock the door behind them. That was enough to prompt a 911 call.

A front door departure was aborted upon sight of approaching police, so the threesome ran out the back, “dropping a large bag containing nearly a million dollars’ worth of jewelry. The only item of jewelry removed from the store was the Rolex watch.”

Simmons was arrested after crawling out of some bushes, wearing only “boxers, socks, makeup on his face, and carrying a walkie-talkie in his hand.”

Hardy ran toward Martin Health System Diagnostic Services emergency room and hopped into a nearby box truck. The truck’s owner approached Hardy to find out why a badly made up guy was treating his truck like a cab.

“The owner of the truck told law enforcement that Hardy immediately exited the truck and left behind a wig, gloves, and sunglasses,” the complaint said.

Police hadn’t found Hardy when a call came in around 12:06 p.m. from a man worried that his pal, J.K., hadn’t been home at the pickup time for their golf game. And, the friend said, J.K. didn’t miss pickup time for a golf game.

Law enforcement found nobody inside at J.K.’s home. A trip through the house found drops of blood on the floor, an unopened gallon of milk on the counter, cell phones and two women’s purses.

Cops were still there when J.K. returned with another chapter to the story.

J.K., from Toronto, Canada, said Hardy, still on the run from police, had two guns and forced J.K., J.K.’s wife, their son and their son’s girlfriend to drive him to Broward County. Hardy had them exit at Sunrise Boulevard and drop him off at Tony’s Market, 800 NW 22nd Rd.

Brinson eventually was arrested April 20 on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Hardy was taken into custody May 8, 2017 after a traffic stop in Orlando.

Each of the four went down on charges of Hobbs Act robbery (affecting interstate or foreign business), conspiracy to commit a Hobbs Act robbery and brandishing a firearm in furtherance of a violent crime. Hardy got an extra four counts of kidnapping.

"Police release security images, sketch of person after two girls groped near Orlando schools","Related Headlines Sketch released of suspected school groper

- Law enforcement officials have released security photos and a composite sketch of the man who reportedly touched two students at two Orlando schools.

The incidents were reported on Monday morning. Parents told The News Station both Boone High School and Blankner Elementary went on brief lockdowns.

According to Orlando Police, around 6:30 in the morning, a Boone High School student was on Ferncreek Avenue walking to school when a man touched her inappropriately.

About two and a half hours later, Orange County Sheriffs Deputies said a student was walking to Blankner Elementary next door, when a man came up behind her and also touched her inappropriately.

During both incidents, the victims said the man was on a bicycle.

The schools sent a message to parents, Monday, advising students to walk in groups.

“I’m picking them up, and right now she had an activity she wanted to go by herself walking around the neighborhood, and that’s a no-no for now,” said one parent.

Detectives plan to release a suspect sketch tomorrow. The suspect was described as a black male, 19-20 years of age, 5'6""-5'7"", short curly hair, clean-shaven, medium build, red t-shirt, Khaki long pants, and dark tennis shoes.

California man who faked suicide to avoid child abuse charges found in Florida nearly 3 years later,"A California sex offender evading law enforcement for nearly three years by faking his own suicide was finally caught living in a storage container in Florida last week, authorities said.

Michael Patrick Manning, 58, was arrested on May 3 by the Monroe County Sheriff’s Department after deputies responded to a burglar alarm at a business at the Stock Island Marina about 1:30 a.m., the Chico Police Department said in a press release.

Manning, who was facing charges related to the alleged sexual assault of a minor and child pornography in California, was found living in an unlocked storage container next to the property.

MASSACHUSETTS TEEN MAULED TO DEATH BY ‘PACK OF DOGS’ HE WAS TENDING TO: POLICE

The suspect falsely identified himself as William Wallace Littlejohn. He had in his possession a U.S. passport and U.S. Navy ID card to back up this claim, officials said.

Police contacted the Navy as well as U.S. Border Patrol and the FBI to verify his identity but the documents were found to be fakes. Police positively identified the suspect as Manning using fingerprint analysis.

According to the Chico Police Department, several search warrants were issued for Manning on Sept. 3, 2015, after a victim age 12-14 accused him of sexually assaulting her in 2008 and 2009.

An arrest warrant was also issued and Manning was taken into custody on four counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a minor under the age of 14 and one count of contacting a minor with intent to commit a felony.

FLORIDA BOY WITH CANCER MUST CONTINUE CHEMO DESPITE PARENT’S WISHES TO USE CANNABIS THERAPY, COURT RULES

He posted bail and was released from the Butte County Jail.

Six days later, Manning was arrested again, accused of possessing and manufacturing child pornography related to the initial search of his home. He posted bail again and was released.

Between the time of his two arrests, police say Manning failed to show for a court-ordered appearance, and a bench warrant for his arrest was issued.

Over a year later, on Oct. 7, 2016, U.S. Parks Service officers located a car belonging to Manning under the Golden Gate Bridge with a suicide note, signed by Manning. Authorities, however, were unable to locate a body.

Police surveilled a “close associate” of Manning which led them to believe that he was still alive and had faked the suicide attempt.

The statewide search expanded and police said they “narrowly missed” Manning on several occasions.

“Residences, storage facilities, and vehicles tied to Manning’s associate were frequently found full of personal property, and hastily abandoned,” Chico police said.

The U.S. Marshal’s Service received a tip in April 2019 that led them to believe he was in Florida.

Man o' Wars washing up on St. Augustine Beach,"ST. AUGUSTINE BEACH, Fla. - Some people heading to St. Augustine Beach have seen some Man o' Wars on the sand. Members of the St. Augustine Lifesaving Association said they have a couple Man o' Wars but nothing too much out of the ordinary.

They said they get pushed onto shore by winds and tides every so often.

The Portuguese man o' war is a predatory species. It uses its feeding tentacles to sting and paralyze small fishes, pelagic crustaceans, and other invertebrates. The feeding tentacles may be up to 160 feet long in some individuals! These tentacles deliver a powerful sting and are also used for defense against predation.

Each individual Portuguese man o' war is either a male or a female, and they reproduce sexually via a method known as broadcast spawning. Large groups of individuals come together, where females release their eggs and males release their sperm into the water column, all at the same time. This method increases the likelihood that eggs will be fertilized.

The Portuguese man o' war is not valuable, commercially, and is common throughout the tropics. In some places, it is increasing in numbers, likely a result of changing open ocean food webs. This species’ sting can be very painful if encountered by people. When there are large numbers of individuals in an area, it is best to avoid swimming.

They are covered in venom-filled nematocysts used to paralyze and kill fish and other small creatures. For humans, a man-of-war sting is excruciatingly painful but rarely deadly.

It lasted less than a minute, but after the man left Jordan called the police.



A few hours later, Brian Slocum realized he was all over the news. He called authorities to explain and soon dozens of officers were outside his home.

No charges for Florida man with obscene sticker on car,"LAKE CITY, Fla. - Charges have been dropped against a Florida man who refused to remove what a deputy considered an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window.

The State Attorney's Office in Columbia County filed court documents Thursday saying it won't prosecute Dillon Shane Webb, 23, who had been charged with obscenity and resisting an officer without violence. The filing said a valid defense could be raised under the First Amendment, which protects free speech.

An arrest report said a deputy stopped Webb in Lake City on Sunday because of a sexually explicit sticker. The deputy cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court.

Officials said the deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused. The deputy then charged Webb with resisting.

"Toy Scout Joel Magee spends $260,000 on rare lunchboxes in visit to R.I.","WARWICK — Toy Scout Joel Magee, the new ""Pawn Stars"" Disney expert, came to Warwick to buy vintage toys this weekend and spent $260,000, the most he's ever spent in one city, on a bunch of lunchboxes.

Advertising that he would pay cash for vintage toys at the Courtyard by Marriott Providence Warwick, 55 Jefferson Park Rd., from Friday through Sunday, he knew he would have a chance to buy a collection of 650 lunch boxes that had slipped his grasp once before.

From his travels across the country acquiring vintage toys, he knew about the man who spent 50 years traveling the country looking for lunch boxes in mint condition. But he lost out to a Johnston man. Now the Johnston man was ready to consider an offer, so Magee scheduled a toy-buying show in Warwick.

It's a show because he brings vintage toys and a copy of a comic book valued at $50,000, the ""Amazing Fantasy No. 15 Comic Book — The First Appearance of Spider Man,"" as his promotional materials say.

Two of his lunch boxes are worth at least $20,000 each, he said by phone Sunday before catching a flight back home to West Palm Beach, Florida. He said both could fetch $25,000. One is the 1954 Superman, ""the very first lunch box"" in full color that came out as soon as they ""developed a really cool process to print on tin.""

The other is from a short-lived show, ""Man from Atlantis,"" starring Patrick Duffy, later of ""Dallas"" fame.

""He had gills,"" said Magee, 57. ""He was like a mermaid only a man."" The show was canceled before the lunch boxes went into production. Only four are known to exist.

A chance encounter with a GI Joe lunch box ""was how I got into this business."" He was bored at an event in Sioux City, Iowa, where he grew up, and from across the room, he said, ""I saw my GI Joe lunch box."" It wasn't actually the one he'd carried as a kid, but memories came flooding back, of the ham and cheese sandwich, no pickles, that his mother would pack for him, and the milk that spent all morning in the thermos and started to turn.

""My mom had pictures in a photo album of us,"" with the toys they got for birthdays and Christmas. He started ""searching for my old toys"" and was seen frequently at flea markets and auctions. People would ask him to watch for items they wanted. ""All of a sudden, I'm looking for everything for everybody.""

He began to specialize in Disneyland items, and the Las Vegas shop featured in ""Pawn Stars"" asked him to appraise items from the California theme park.

He was involved when a pirate ship from the Peter Pan ride, valued at $240,000, changed hands. He'll be in an episode airing July 1, in which a piece of Disneyland that the History Channel will not allow him to disclose will be part of the reality show.

People often ask him to look ""in my toy crystal ball"" and say which of today's toys will be valuable in the future. Usually, toys start to gain value when the children who played with them reach their 40s, he said.

He predicts a promising future for Harry Potter.

He is also asked how toy collectors ""get them so minty,"" as in never-played-with condition. Sometimes they come from people who used to work at the factory, he said, or who had them as promotional items.

Many of them come from this scenario: ""Parents would buy toys for their kids, and the kids were snoopy,"" so the parents would hide the toy and forget all about it.

Thirty or more years later, it could be valuable.

Investigators found blood evidence linked to Maleah in his apartment, police said in a Saturday news release.

Vence, 26, was arrested Saturday at a relative's house in Sugar Land, southwest of Houston, police said. A court appearance is scheduled for Monday.

Police refer to Vence as Maleah's stepfather.

A spokesman for the mother's family told CNN the two were engaged but that has ended. Police previously had spelled his first name as Darion.

Vence has told police that last Saturday he was driving to the airport to pick up Maleah's mother and had Maleah and his 1-year-old son in his car.

On the way, he heard a ""popping noise,"" stopped his vehicle because he thought he had a flat tire and was knocked unconscious by three strangers who pulled up in a blue pickup truck, he told police.

When he woke up a day later, the boy was still there but Maleah was gone, he told police.

Vence's car, a silver Nissan Altima, was found two days ago in the parking of a shopping mall in Missouri City, Texas. Police said a laundry basket and a gas can were found in the trunk.

Vence had been seen carrying the laundry basket from his apartment, police said. They are asking for people who may know where the gas can was sold to contact the homicide division.

CNN has reached out to Vence several times this week, but didn't receive a reply. It's unclear if he has a lawyer.

WALTON COUNTY, Fla.- A Panama City man is arrested in Walton County after soliciting who he thought was a 14-year-old girl, for sex.

26 year-old Christopher Jackson Jr. engaged with an undercover officer through a social media account depicting a 14-year-old female.

Reports said during the exchange, Jackson got increasingly sexual in nature and asked for nude pictures.

He also indicated through his chats that he wanted to have sex with the juvenile. Jackson is charged with two counts of using a computer to solicit a child for sex and traveling to meet a minor for sex, both felonies in the state of Florida.

He's been booked into the Walton County jail.

Florida Panhandle man runs voice-over business from home,"PACE — What does a retired naval flight officer and former Navy Choir director do after serving his country? Join a barbershop singing group? Check. Sit in his patio and enjoy a nice Irish whiskey in the evening? Check. How about voice-over recordings from a walk-in closet in his bedroom? Still doing that.

John Harnish, owner of Harnish Voice Overs LLC, has spent the past nine years recording his voice in his Pace home's closet studio.

He admits that his recording space — among his shirts, slacks and shoes — is a bit unusual.

""I like it in here,"" Harnish admits of his closet/recording studio. ""It has great acoustics and the clothes and pillows in here help with the sound quality.""

Harnish said his first experience making money with his voice was at the University of West Florida in the early 1970s. He would record radio announcements for WCOA-AM while he finished his degree in communication arts. After graduation Harnish began his military career.

After retiring from the Navy, Harnish returned to Milton with his wife Jan and settled down. One day after a church service, a member of the congregation asked him if he had ever done voice-over recordings. The parishioner who had asked also owned a casting service, paving the way to Harnish's next career.

""I don't know if it's a career or more of a hobby,"" Harnish says.

His first love is singing. He is a member of the Pensacola Bay Harmonizers, a barbershop harmony-singing group as described on their Facebook page.

Harnish has many voice-over credits. Most of them are ""short-form jobs,"" which are 16- to 30-second commercials or political ads that can pay anywhere from $200 to $400 an hour. Short-form jobs typically take Harnish about 30 minutes to complete but it depends on the project. The pay also depends on whether the project is a Screen Actor Guild (SAG) union job or a non-union job. A SAG job has standard rates for each type of job and pays more than non-union projects.

Long-form jobs can last for hours and pay less. Harnish has a one-hour documentary to his credit that he did for Iraqi television through a United Kingdom company called Whisper Audio. For this job, they wanted an English voice-over for the entire documentary so viewers could have their choice of languages. It took 12 hours of work to complete one hour of finished documentary work. That job paid $900 for the entire project.

The third market that Harnish concentrates on is audio books. He has six to his credit so far.

""It takes anywhere from four to eight hours for one hour of completed audio book recording,"" Harnish said. ""Then you have to figure out how you want to charge it.""

Harnish said he can take a lump sum hourly wage of a few hundred dollars or receive royalties that pay in perpetuity, meaning he receives a check as long as the recording continues to sell. Up to 50 percent of the purchase price is paid back in royalties, Harnish said.

Harnish says he could make a very good living from voice-overs if he put all his time into the work.

""I still love singing. When I give that up I may devote more time to the voice-overs,"" Harnish says with a grin.

Then he leans over and whispers in a different voice, ""He will never stop singing,"" and chuckles.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190511/florida-panhandle-man-runs-voice-over-business-from-home?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T16:20:22Z,Daytona Beach News,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA"

Two South Carolina inmates are charged in a sextortion blackmail scheme that led to the death of a 24-year-old Army veteran, authorities announced Friday.Greenville Police Chief Ken Miller said a months-long investigation led to blackmail charges against Lee Correctional inmates John William Dobbins Jr., 59, of North Charleston, and Carl Richard Smith Jr., 43, of Simpsonville.Miller said Dobbins and Smith used a contraband cellphone to operate a dating app scam in which they pretended to be a young woman and eventually exchanged nude pictures. They then pretended to be the parents of the young woman, who they claimed was underage, and threatened criminal charges and demanded money, Miller said. The victims, even innocent, would often pay, the chief said.An investigation called Operation Surprise Party uncovered a sextortion ring in the Carolinas in which inmates used contraband cellphones to target 442 service members from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. Authorities said the schemes cost service members more than $560,000.One victim of the scam was Jared Johns, Miller said. He served in the Army and was injured in Afghanistan. The father of two came home to battle post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.The scammers demanded nearly $1,200 from Johns. On Sept. 11, 2018, less than 24 hours after receiving the texts, Johns committed suicide. His twin brother found him.Johns left messages behind, including one on a dry erase board that said: “I’m sorry I’ve messed up. I love you all. This is not what I wanted. Tell my sons I was a good man.”“It was the thought of being arrested,” Johns’ mother, Kathy Bowling. said. “They convinced him he did something wrong.”After some investigating and law enforcement confirmation, Johns' parents later learned at least one inmate from Lee Correctional Facility scammed their son, sending texts from prison.“They never should have been able to reach him,” Bowling said. “I’m angry and you can’t put into words how you feel as a parent.”Johns' father said he wanted people to know his son was a great man, soldier and father.“These prisoners were put in there to protect us from them doing any more crime,” Kevin Johns said. “They are in there still doing crimes and people are still getting hurt.”The Johns pushed for legislation that would encourage state prisons to jam cellphone service.“These jammers are needed now more than ever, because I don’t want another family to have to go through what we went through,” Bowling said.Brian Sterling, with the South Carolina Department of Corrections, was at Friday’s news conference with Miller. He said he wants to see inmates cellphone signals banned. He said the solution is simple: jam signals and use geo-fencing.He said without taking those actions, prisons are “virtually out here, among us.”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/tell-my-sons-i-was-a-good-man-sextortion-scam-led-to-young-army-vets-death-police-say/27440777,2019-05-11T09:34:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA"

Web Exclusive: Florida Man tries to sell baby as a prank,"SARASOTA, Fla. (WFLA) - A massive manhunt ensued after a Florida man tried to pawn his baby. Turns out, it was a prank gone wrong and the man is now speaking out, saying he's very sorry for what happened.

On Tuesday evening, a man entered the A&F Pawn shop in Sarasota, Florida and made a strange request to store owner Richard Jordan.

""The weirdest, strangest situation we've ever encountered,” said Jordan. ""He put it on the counter, he was pretty serious about it. He spun the baby around, and said- can I pawn this?""

It lasted less than a minute, but after he left Jordan called the police. A few hours later, Brian Slocum realized he was all over the news. He called authorities to explain and soon dozens of officers were outside his home.

""They didn't find it funny or hilarious at all and there was a lot of resources and time and money that went into it,” said Slocum.

Slocum is a single dad with a seven-month-old son named Caden.

At the urging of his nephew, he started making silly videos on Snapchat. On Tuesday, Slocum recorded his latest stunt.

In the Snapchat video Slocum says: “This is what I got, I know no one under 18 in here but he's barely used, 7-and-a-half months old, what do you think he's worth?""

He didn't think the manager would take it seriously.

""I was thinking I'd go in there and the guy would be like, oh if it was my son, I'd give you ten grand or something,” said Slocum.

Slocum says his joke obviously fell flat.

""This is not funny! This is not funny, this is serious business,” said Jordan.

""There's nothing in the world I would trade for my son, he's my world. Nor any money is worth him,” said Slocum.

Sarasota police are not charging him, and Slocum has learned his lesson. He has a warning for others.

""It was a prank, it was skit and a lot of these young people don't realize that doing things like this has a consequence,” said Slocum.",http://www.siouxlandproud.com/news/web-exclusive-florida-man-tries-to-sell-baby-as-a-prank/1994643695,2019-05-10T16:30:39Z,KCAU,"5943 IA-12, Sioux City, IA 51106, USA"

Plantation man tells police he shot 'disrespectful' wife in face,"Fernando De Baere, 73, is accused of shooting his wife in the face at their Plantation home.

PLANTATION, Fla. - A 73-year-old man shot his wife in the face this week inside their Plantation home, then walked to a neighbor's house and confessed that he'd killed her, authorities said.

Plantation police investigators said Fernando De Baere told them he shot Marisa Sherman, 47, because she wouldn't stop speaking disrespectfully.

According to an arrest report, De Baere went to a neighbor's home Tuesday night and told them he had just killed his wife.

The neighbor called 911 and a responding officer found De Baere's wife sitting upright on the living room couch with an apparent gunshot wound to the face, the report stated.

The officer pronounced Sherman dead at 10:36 p.m.

No one else was inside the home, authorities said.

Police said De Baere had blood splatters on his legs and boxer shorts. He told police he and his wife were arguing over her interactions with a former co-worker.

According to the police report, De Baere said he took issue with ""the way that she was talking to him."" When she wouldn't stop talking, he got his .38-caliber handgun and shot her, authorities said.

Police said De Baere admitted to shooting his wife ""one or two times"" in the face while standing about 3 feet away from her.

Authorities said De Baere put his gun back in his closet after the shooting before going to his neighbor's home.

De Baere told police his home is equipped with surveillance cameras inside and outside the home, the report stated.

De Baere was arrested on a premeditated murder charge. A lawyer for him isn't listed on jail records.

MIAMI - A 50-year-old man was arrested Thursday in connection with the attempted kidnapping of a 12-year-old girl in Miami, authorities said.

Terry Rivers, of Miami, faces charges of kidnapping and lewd and lascivious molestation of a child.

According to an arrest report, the victim was walking to her bus stop the morning of April 12 in the area of Northwest First Avenue and 57th Street when she was approached by Rivers.

""Hey. Where are you going?"" Rivers asked her, according to the report.

""I'm going over there,"" the girl responded.

""But where are you going?"" Rivers asked again, according to the report.

Police said the girl ignored Rivers' question and continued walking east.

She told police she turned around a short time later to find Rivers running toward her.

Police said Rivers grabbed the victim by the hair and waist, pulled her toward him and began to grope her breast.

Authorities said the victim pushed Rivers away and ran back toward her house.

Police said Rivers ran away in an unknown direction.

Authorities later released a sketch of the suspect, which led to police receiving an anonymous tip identifying Rivers as the victim's attacker.

According to the arrest report, the victim then identified Rivers in a six-person photo lineup.

Police said Rivers denied having any involvement in the incident and claimed he has never been in the area where the incident occurred or came into contact with any children.

"Florida man, 73, tells police he shot 'disrespectful' wife in the face, killing 47-year-old Marisa Sherman","Police investigators say Fernando De Baere told them he shot his wife, 47-year-old Marisa Sherman, because she wouldn't stop with the disrespectful talk.

PLANTATION — Authorities say a 73-year-old man shot his wife in the face inside their Florida home, and then walked to a neighbor's house and confessed that he'd killed her.

Plantation police investigators say Fernando De Baere told them he shot 47-year-old Marisa Sherman because she wouldn't stop with the disrespectful talk.

The SunSentinel reports the neighbor called 911 on Tuesday night. De Baere had blood splatters on his legs and boxer shorts. He told police he and his wife were arguing over her interactions with a former coworker.

A police report says De Baere says he took issue with ""the way that she was talking to him."" When she wouldn't stop talking, he got the gun and shot her.

ORLANDO, Fla. (WESH) — A TV show about the Sunshine State’s most outrageous crimes is in the works.

Oxygen is developing a true crime series centered around the state’s “most outrageous, notorious and craftiest killers.”

“When the murder is so bizarre, the motive so far-fetched and the crime so outlandish that it sounds like something from a Hollywood screenplay—there’s a good chance it was actually committed by a “Florida Man,” a description of the series on Oxygen’s website reads.

The show, according to Oxygen, will unravel the strange twists and turns of Florida crimes and try to reason how and why Florida killers took their crimes to levels beyond comprehension.

The show will be called “Florida Man.” It will be produced by Blumhouse Television.

""With access to Florida investigators and prosecutors, this series zeroes in on America’s most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State. The series will unravel the strange twists and turns and try in vain to reason how and why this breed of killers took their crimes to levels beyond comprehension,"" the synopsis said.

The network did not give a premiere date for the series, but said it is in development.

The announcement comes on the heels of the viral ""Florida Man"" challenge that circulated on social media in March, where users Googled the phrase ""Florida Man"" along with their birthday to find out which story happened on the day they were born.

For example, someone with a birthday on November 5th would type ""Florida man November 5"" into Google and get pages of search results with news stories, including this gem: ""Florida man bitten after jumping into crocodile pool at alligator farm.""",http://www.fox13news.com/news/florida-news/-florida-man-tv-series-coming-to-oxygen-network,2019-05-09T20:06:41Z,FOX 13 NEWS,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA"
Stronach Group at center of best and worst of horse racing,"The Stronach Group isn't well known outside of horse racing.

That distinction goes to the likes of modern Triple Crown winners American Pharoah and Justify, trainer Bob Baffert and legends of the past including Secretariat and Seattle Slew.

But few — if any — have had a bigger impact on the sport in recent years than the Stronach Group, led by Frank Stronach, Belinda Stronach and Tim Ritvo. They're the movers and shakers of the Canadian-based company that has recently been at the center of much of the good, the bad and the ugly of horse racing.

""No question the Stronach Group and the Stronach family invest in horse racing,"" National Thoroughbred Racing Association president and CEO Alex Waldrop said. ""They do invest heavily in the business, and you've got to acknowledge that and thank them for that.""

And blame them at times.

They own seven U.S. tracks, are credited for saving the industry in Maryland, boosted the sport in Florida and established the richest horse race in the world. They're also the subject of multiple family lawsuits, an ongoing quarrel over the future of the Preakness that's again the conversation with the race coming up this week, and own Santa Anita Park, which was the site of 23 horse deaths over a span of three months.

But love them or loathe them, it's fair to say horse racing wouldn't be where it is right now without the Stronach Group.

Before the disqualification of Maximum Security in the Kentucky Derby, the fatalities at Santa Anita dealt another blow to horse racing's reputation and put the Stronach Group under the microscope. East Coast officials criticized the Stronach Group for being slow to react and institute reforms.

Waldrop praised the Stronach Group and horsemen in California for getting the situation under control. There's considerable debate over how the aftermath was handled and changes implemented, but Stronach Group executives did it their way.

""The long term of thoroughbred racing, whether it be in Maryland, California or Florida or anywhere in the U.S. is reliant on having healthy horses, healthy trainers, healthy jockeys and all of the above,"" CEO Bill Hecht said. ""We will continue to work very closely with the breeders and the trainers and the horsemen to affect the very best solution for the health of all of those groups.""

Long before the fatalities at Santa Anita forced the Stronach Group to find a solution to that problem, it has been fighting with Maryland lawmakers over the Preakness. The argument over whether the Preakness will continue to be run at Baltimore's aging Pimlico Race Course or the company's favored Laurel Park, 30 miles down the road, has become a tiresome mid-May tradition.

The Stronach Group's fingerprints are all over the sport.

Austrian-Canadian billionaire Frank Stronach made his money in auto parts and wanted to put it into horse racing. It was his idea in 2016 to launch the Pegasus World Cup at Gulfstream Park in Florida, which now has the biggest purse in the world at $16 million.

""Frank is the only man that's invested his life earnings in racing,"" longtime Maryland-based owner and trainer Linda Gaudet said. ""Nobody can criticize him for that because nobody else wants to do that. There's nobody out there that will do that. Nobody's going to fix a racetrack, build a racetrack.""

Gaudet still remembers Dec. 4, 2015, when Ritvo came into Maryland and ""saved"" the industry there after some rough years. She said Stronach, Ritvo and Maryland Jockey Club president and general manager Sal Sintra took the state's racing operation from ""the bottom of the rung"" back to respectability.

""The stuff (Ritvo) got done in a short amount of time was amazing,"" Gaudet said. ""He has a tough management style, but he's effective. And if somebody's not doing their job, move on to the next one.""

That's not limited to Maryland. Even though his name isn't on the company, Ritvo has plenty of influence and has become something of a fixer when problems arise.

""Tim Ritvo, he's a dynamo,"" Waldrop said. ""He's a force to be reckoned with. Not everyone likes that approach, but I take my hat off to him for working with all the parties involved in the situation and getting it right now at Santa Anita.""

Not everyone in the Stronach family likes each other all that much right now, at least from a business standpoint. Frank in September sued his daughter, two grandchildren and former business associate Alon Ossip for over $500 million in Ontario Superior Court alleging they mismanaged the family's assets and conspired to take control of them.

Belinda Stronach countersued her father in January, saying in a statement of defense that he lost vast sums of money on pet projects.

Hecht said whether its family infighting, safety at Santa Anita or problems at Pimlico, the horse racing spotlight — rightly or wrongly — will continue to shine on the Stronach Group.

""They can't blow their nose without somebody seeing something wrong,"" Gaudet said. ""All the optics are on them right now.""

Mississippi officer mourned; suspect's mother says son was troubled,"BILOXI, Miss. — Residents in a Mississippi Gulf Coast city continued on Tuesday to mourn the death of a longtime officer who authorities said was gunned down by a man whose mental health had, according to his mother, been sliding in recent months.

A local NAACP leader said the man had threatened to shoot his goddaughter in 2018 when both were high school students.

A public memorial service was held Tuesday evening for Biloxi Patrolman Robert McKeithen, who was shot to death in the parking lot outside the city's police station Sunday night. Darian Tawan Atkinson, 19, is jailed without bail on capital murder charges. McKeithen, a Biloxi officer for 23 years, was shot multiple times. It remains unclear whether the 58-year-old was targeted or shot at random.

Gulfport Police spokesman Lt. Joshua Bromen said search warrants were being served Tuesday. He declined to say whether a gun had been found.

Atkinson's mother, Pamela Broger, told The Associated Press that if her son shot McKeithen, it was because of mental health problems Broger said had developed in recent months.

""Darian went to Texas to work in August,"" Broger said. ""He came back two months later and he was a completely different person. I don't know if something happened there because he wouldn't talk to me. I don't know if it was drugs.""

Broger said she had called police officers for assistance, but said officers told her they couldn't do anything because Atkinson wasn't hurting anyone.

""I'm not saying he didn't do it,"" Broger said. ""But if he did, it was because he was suffering.""

She also denied that her older son, Davian Atkinson, had done anything to merit being arrested. The 21-year-old was booked into the Harrison County jail early Tuesday on an accessory charge alleging he aided his brother.

Broger said Darian Atkinson came home Sunday night when the family didn't know about the shooting, and left Monday in Davian Atkinson's car. Bromen said ""obviously something more is involved"" in the brother's charge, noting the mother wasn't charged.

Others see Darian differently than his mother. Biloxi NAACP chapter President James Crowell told the Sun Herald that Darian Atkinson threatened his goddaughter in February 2018 when the two were Biloxi High School students discussing the shooting at Florida's Parkland High School.

""He said, 'I'm thinking about doing the same thing here and I'm going to start with you,' "" Crowell said Tuesday.

He said that his goddaughter's family reported the threat to Biloxi High School, but nothing happened until they demanded an investigation. Crowell held a news conference at the time, saying parents should have been notified. WXXV-TV reported then that the accused student, never named publicly, was suspended for three days.

""Even back then, he was threatening people,"" Crowell said Tuesday. ""I guess he went ahead and did it this time rather than just talk about it.""

Spokeswoman Jennifer Pyron said privacy laws prevent release of student records. Gulfport Police Chief Leonard Papania, who's leading the investigation, didn't respond to a text from the AP.

At the police station where McKeithen was killed, mourners continued to deposit tributes on his police SUV, overflowing onto tables the city set up.

Patricia Underwood said she drove from Gulfport to pay her respects to a man who convinced her goddaughter to remain in high school. She said her goddaughter called her in tears Monday night.

""She just cried and cried,"" Underwood said. She said her goddaughter was working at a Biloxi Waffle House two years ago and told McKeithen, a regular at the restaurant, that she was thinking of dropping out.

""He told her she didn't need to get out of school; she needed to stay in and walk across that stage and graduate. And she did,"" Underwood said.

She was joined by Linda Virgil, who retired from a Dillard's department store where McKeithen did off-duty work as a security guard.

""He would stay later to walk us to our cars every night,"" she said.

She said he loved to talk about his wife and the diamond rings he bought her, and about his children. ""He helped everybody,"" Virgil said.

Biloxi Police Capt. Milton Houseman said he was one of the officers who brought in Atkinson. Asked if he had any idea why Atkinson smiled as he was brought into the police department after his arrest 40 miles (65 kilometers) away in Wiggins, Houseman said, ""I wouldn't venture a guess as to what was in his mind.""

Atkinson's first appearance in court could come as early as Wednesday, when a judge will consider bail and could appoint a lawyer. His brother Davian Atkinson is held on $500,000 bail.

State criminal records show no felony convictions for either Atkinson brother. Davian Atkinson was cited for speeding and other traffic offenses once in 2016 and once in 2017.",https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20190512/mississippi-officer-mourned-suspects-mother-says-son-was-troubled?rssfeed=true,2019-05-12T23:20:06Z,Tuscaloosa News,"3rd St, Tuscaloosa, AL 35401, USA"

Our community has suffered a terrible loss with the deaths of former UMass Boston Chancellor Sherry Penney and her beloved husband, Jim Livingston. They are dead from apparent carbon monoxide poisoning in their winter home in Sarasota, Florida. Their extended family of friends, colleagues and students – all of whose lives were touched by this dynamic and loving couple – are in shock.

Sherry had been interim president of the University of Massachusetts, Chancellor of UMass Boston and a provost at Yale University, but she especially left her mark as the creator and driver of the Emerging Leaders Program in the Center for Collaborative Leadership at UMass Boston. Over the last 18 years, hundreds of young professionals have been tapped to develop their leadership skills and take their place among the future shapers of our community. They are bright, diverse and the faces of the future. Sherry's enthusiasm and hard work built a vast network of the region's corporate, government and non-profit sectors. It was very hard to say No to Sherry Penney. Her many honors and awards are just a small suggestion of the significance of her many accomplishments.

Sherry's husband, Jim Livingston, was a research physicist. He retired, then taught for 20 years in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT, then retired again, spending much time writing articles for professional and popular science publications. He also had a strong interest in American history, and, with Sherry, co-authored a biography of the 19th century feminist and abolitionist Martha Coffin Wright entitled, “A Very Dangerous Woman: Martha Wright and Women's Rights.” A man of quiet dignity and gentle humor, he was an avid tennis player. He was a full participant in Sherry's many causes and always beside her in her many public commitments.

Sherry and Jim were a wonderful couple, always a joy to be with. Each left an imprint on the world around them, and always for the better. They lived full lives, and the tragedy of their deaths cannot be overestimated.

Does cancer lobby want to cure cancer to make money?: your say,"0512 CARTOON (Photo: Rick McKee, The Augusta Chronicle, GA)

Tough question

A few years ago, we launched a recording object into space and hit a comet traveling about 35,000 miles per hour.

Our scientists knew the time of impact, the direction, its depth in space, and all surrounding bodies that might have an effect on the trajectory of this historic event. The science, mathematics, and knowledge going into this project was perfect and enormously effective.

A radio engineer, John Kanzius with a limited scientific education by that standard, invented a radio wave treatment heating nano-particles to kill cancerous tumors without damaging surrounding tissue. Thrust onto the scene, it got funding. Now its in needless litigation about money, who gets to spend it, and who gets paid the most if it succeeds.

Does the cancer research lobby care about curing cancer or living off its continuance? Tough question?

What do you think?

Target polluters

We keep hearing we need to get rid of plastic bags, straws and cups because of plastic ocean pollution, but the U.S. is very low at number 20 of nations that plastic pollute, with 0.9 percent of mismanaged plastic waste compared with China’s 27.7 percent (USA TODAY).

The U.S.’s excellent record is due to our garbage collection and recycling programs. Here in Fort Myers, most ocean plastic pollution is caused by boaters, fishermen and beachgoers. Land-based folks who dispose of garbage and plastic in suitable containers contribute a minuscule amount of plastic to our waterways.

I can’t see land-based folks having to pay the price for other polluting countries and marine polluters by sacrificing the convenience of our plastic bags, straws and cups.

Warm person

I met Joe Biden, in his home, when I interviewed him as a senator. I met Donald Trump, when I interviewed him at his office in Trump Tower, at one of his failed casinos in Atlantic City, and aboard his ship-yacht, The Princess, before he lost that to creditors. I’d take Joe Biden over the crooked Trump, any day. Biden is a very warm and caring person. Trump is a cold and self-serving.



It’s a shame that partisans call Biden creepy. He’s a genuinely, warm person. The day I interviewed him, he put his hand on my shoulder (gasp), looked me straight in the eye, and thanked me for my work. Trump just talked about himself. But I won’t vote for either man. Trump lacks integrity, values and never accepts personal responsibility. Biden represents the establishment. And like Republicans, Biden sees no problem with the money in our politics today.



I’d rather see a much younger person, who is interested in all people, rather than in corporations, the wealthy, and dark money. Corporations aren’t even mentioned in our Constitution, but people are. And, corporations are not people, they’re fictitious entities.

Doing job

As in Newton's Law of Motion, so it is in the Mailbag: to every action (idea) there is always an equal and opposite reaction, so it seems. Here is my reaction to the writer who called President Trump ""an incompetent, destructive fool with a mental problem.""

In two years, this ""fool"" has produced an economy that has translated into real jobs and real income.

The unemployment rate is 3.6% and wages for low income workers are rising at nearly twice that of higher-paid workers, all reported by Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council. Trump has done this by being more aggressive and pro-growth than past administrations and by cutting red tape, deregulating, selling our products overseas, being tougher on trade regulations and by cutting taxes. He could also stop the border invasion if the House Democrats would help.

One may not like this or that about Trump but an incompetent fool he is not. He has succeeded – and done so despite a hostile media, fake news and a dishonest investigation intended to take him down. He is doing the job.

And it is said our economy is the envy of the world.

"Century after historic transatlantic flight, NC-4 still captures spirit of exploration","CLOSE The National Naval Aviation Museum’s latest exhibit allows guests to experience the Apollo 11 moon landing in VR. Melissa Nelson Gabriel, mnelsongab@pnj.com

A century after the landmark days in May 1919 when it captured headlines as the first aircraft to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, the NC-4 (NC stands for Navy-Curtiss, the latter the primary manufacturer) flying boat immediately attracted the attention of visitors to the National Naval Aviation Museum.

Early photographs of the airplane being assembled in 1974 after arrival on loan from the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., show finishing work being performed on the interior of the building in which it has been housed for nearly 50 years. Once the sole structure on the museum’s current campus, it is now the south wing. The museum has literally grown up around the NC-4.

Aviation is a fast-paced technological field and the history of the NC-4 reflects that. Consider that the airplane had a top speed of 85 mph and just 50 years after its flight across the Atlantic, man ventured to the moon. In the arena of transatlantic flight, it took just days after the NC-4’s crossing for a British airplane to fly non-stop from Newfoundland to Ireland. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh accomplished the feat alone and he has been synonymous with transatlantic flight ever since.

Following his flight, Lindbergh crossed the country and visited Latin America in his airplane The Spirit of St. Louis. The NC-4 made a similar splash when it returned to the United States, where it was displayed in Central Park and seen by nearly one million people in just two weeks. One reporter wrote at the time that the airplane ""has not been repainted or decorated since her record-making trip, but presents practically the same appearance she did at the end of her flight. ... All this is just as it should be and the crowds who saw the ship yesterday appeared to be especially pleased.""

That did not last long. The Navy repaired the airplane so that it could fly on a 44-stop recruiting tour down the eastern seaboard, around the tip of Florida (it stopped at NAS Pensacola twice), and into the Midwest that covered 6,690 miles. One can only imagine what it was like for everyday Americans, most of whom had never seen an airplane fly, behold the NC-4 with its 126-foot wingspan descending to a water landing near their town.

However, as years passed, the NC-4 was largely forgotten. For a time, the Smithsonian owned the hull and the Navy retained the other components. Not until 1961 did the former acquire all of the aircraft and it was just in time to start a multi-year restoration process resulting the airplane being displayed on the National Mall in the nation’s capital in 1969 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its transatlantic flight.

At the time, the Smithsonian was planning a new building that would open in July 1976. Budgetary restrictions resulted in a smaller structure than originally planned and there was no room for the NC-4. Fortuitously, what was then called the Naval Aviation Museum was in the midst of its own expansion and the rest is history. The museum is fortunate to have the airplane on display on this, the 100th anniversary of its historic feat, which captured the spirit of exploration as did those who participate in another historic event we commemorate this year, the Apollo 11 moon landing. Believe it or not there is a personal link between the two events. The signature approving the loan of the NC-4 was that of Michael Collins, the Command Module pilot of Apollo 11 who after retiring from NASA became the director of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.

Blocked sidewalks irk former Shalimar mayor,"SHALIMAR — Longtime former Mayor Gary Combs has been on a self-described “crusade.”

He served as the town’s mayor for 20 years before passing the gavel to Mark Franks last month.

But judging by recent emails he’s sent to Franks and other Shalimar officials, Combs hasn’t lost any of his activist spirit for the town, which covers about a quarter square mile and has a little more than 800 residents.

An email Combs sent to officials on Wednesday contained photos of two vehicles blocking driveway sidewalks and of an apparently illegally-parked boat on a trailer.

“Today, at least three times, I witnessed a SPD (Shalimar Police Department) cruiser pass by my house -- so much for enforcement of ROW parking as this boat on a trailer and extra trailer have been parked on Town ROW for the past two days – (it) is still there now and it’s definitely not behind the signs which say no parking beyond this point,” wrote Combs, who owns five rental properties in Shalimar.

That email also contained his concern about the sidewalk-blocking autos.

“Even with only one vehicle in the drive (been this way all day), the resident still chooses to block the sidewalk,” Combs said about one of the vehicles.

He followed up that email with another one to town officials on Thursday.

“I understand from emails and meeting minutes, the Town of Shalimar attorney has told the Town Commission and Shalimar Police Department that they do not need to enforce the Florida Statues on blocking sidewalks in driveways,” Combs wrote.

According to statute 316.1945: Except when necessary to avoid conflict with other traffic, or in compliance with law or the directions of a police officer or official traffic control device, no person shall stop, stand, or park a vehicle on a sidewalk.

Combs said pedestrians can legally walk down the town’s streets when residents block the sidewalk.

“So, if the Town of Shalimar wants to legally allow pedestrians to walk in the streets, then the Town needs to remove all existing sidewalks!” he said in his email. “Why is it that only a few have to ruin it for the many? The answer is politicians allow it!”

Combs also said that when he moved to Shalimar more than two decades ago, town police “never allowed a resident to block the sidewalk with a permanently parked vehicle.

“As you can tell I am on a crusade! Just for the record, I am not in favor of removing sidewalks. I just want them to be available for safe pedestrian traffic where they exist!”

On Friday, Franks said the Town Commission conducted a workshop on parking issues on April 23. It took place two weeks after Combs passed the gavel to Franks.

“I was hoping he would have showed up but he didn’t,” Franks said of the former mayor.

According to the workshop minutes, town Police Chief John Cash said enforcing the rule against parking on driveway sidewalks would take quite a bit of time and would take away from other police duties.

The police department consists of Cash, a captain and two officers.

At the workshop, Franks asked if any residents wanted to speak on the issue of parking on sidewalks.

According to the meeting minutes, “Resident Frank Kane said that they have lived in the Town of Shalimar for many years and never have seen where a vehicle blocking the sidewalk was a safety issue.”

Kane is the man who Combs singled out in his email on Wednesday for two incidents of a vehicle blocking a driveway sidewalk. One photo showed the driveway at Kane's house and the other showed the driveway at Kane’s rental unit, according to Combs.

At the workshop, the commission agreed to leave it up to the police department to enforce any specific safety issue on a case-by-case basis.",https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20190512/blocked-sidewalks-irk-former-shalimar-mayor?rssfeed=true,2019-05-12T07:59:03Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,"2 Eglin Pkwy NE, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548, USA"
Man who stood through sunroof on I-4 faces domestic violence charges,"- A man who was the subject of a bizarre and dangerous video depicting him standing through his sunroof driving down I-4 is now facing multiple charges stemming from domestic violence incidents involving his wife.

Leonard Olsen, 70, has been behind bars since the release of a video recorded by an off-duty Hillsborough County Sheriff's deputy. It showed Olsen with his arms spread wide driving down I-4 Tuesday using cruise control and reaching speeds of up to 100 miles per hour.

The Florida Highway Patrol later pulled him over and arrested him for reckless driving.

A short time later, The Polk County Sheriff's Office tacked on additional charges of false imprisonment, violent battery by strangulation and two counts of violent aggravated battery on a person older than 65. The sheriff's office said all the charges stem from incidents involving his wife.

The probable cause statement lists two incidents over the course of about a week.

Continue reading below

On April 30, Olsen was upset with his wife for taking too long to come to bed. Once she did, the statement said he ""reached over and began choking the victim.""

Days later on May 5, after the victim came home from dinner, Olsen ""began calling the victim vulgar names and accusing her of having an affair,"" according to the sheriff's office. That same day, the statement says he destroyed her clothes and forced her to remove her underwear.

His wife called authorities the next morning after Olsen left the home.

FOX 13 News knocked on Olsen's door Saturday, but no one answered.

Neighbors didn't want to go on camera, but said they've had multiple issues with Olsen, including one back in 2017, when they said Olsen fired off his gun multiple times in his backyard. SWAT responded to the incident.

He was later charged with discharging a firearm in public.

“We aren’t sure what was going on with Olsen the last few days but it’s never OK to put your hands on someone else, or endanger others while driving,"" Sheriff Grady Judd said in a statement released Saturday. ""We hope he’s learned a few lessons and gets the help he needs to avoid future jail time.”

As of Saturday night, Olsen remains in the Polk County Jail on $21,000 bond.",http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/man-who-stood-through-sunroof-on-i-4-faces-domestic-violence-charges,2019-05-12T03:17:46Z,FOX 13 NEWS,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA"

GENEVA (AP) — Almost every country in the world has agreed on a legally binding framework for reducing polluting plastic waste, with the United States a notable exception, United Nations environmental officials said Friday.

An agreement on tracking thousands of types of plastic waste emerged at the end of a two-week meeting of U.N.-backed conventions on plastic waste and toxic, hazardous chemicals. Discarded plastic clutters pristine land, floats in huge masses in oceans and entangles wildlife, sometimes with deadly results.

Rolph Payet of the United Nations Environment Program said the “historic” agreement linked to the 186-country, U.N.-supported Basel Convention means countries will have to monitor and track movements of plastic waste outside their borders.

“It’s sending a very strong political signal to the rest of the world — to the private sector, to the consumer market — that we need to do something,” Payet said. “Countries have decided to do something which will translate into real action on the ground.”

The deal affects products used in a broad array of industries, such as health care, technology, aerospace, fashion, and food and beverages.

Countries will have to figure out their own ways of adhering to the accord, Payet said. Even the few non-signatory countries, like the United States, could be impacted when they ship plastic waste to countries that are on board.

Payet credited Norway for leading the initiative, which first was presented in September. The time from then to approval was a blistering pace of change by traditional U.N. standards.

The framework “is historic in the sense that it is legally binding,” Payet said. “They (the countries) have managed to use an existing international instrument to put in place those measures.”

The agreement is likely to lead to customs agents being on the lookout for electronic or other types of potentially hazardous waste more than before.

“There is going to be a transparent and traceable system for export and import of plastic waste,” Payet said.",https://www.wfla.com/national/almost-every-country-in-the-world-signs-plastic-waste-agreement-except-us/1996720142,2019-05-11T21:54:13Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"
Man extricated from pickup that overturned Saturday on I-75,"Marion County Fire Rescue officials extricated a Titusville man from a pickup that slammed into an Interstate 75 guardrail and then entered a highway where it overturned onto its roof early Saturday morning.

Brandon Ceon, the 33-year-old driver and sole occupant in an older model Chevy Silverado, was transported to Ocala Regional Medical Center where he’s expected to recover from his injuries, according to a Florida Highway Patrol trooper on scene. Ceon was wearing a seat belt, according to the trooper.

FHP officials were notified about the single-vehicle wreck shortly after 12:30 a.m.

The crash, located less than five miles from the County Road 484 exit, blocked the middle and left lanes on I-75 southbound for several hours.

It was the second single vehicle crash that shut down two lanes of I-75 within the last several days. On Monday night, the driver of a semi-truck hauling 41,000 pounds of bananas crashed into the guardrail and overturned onto its side roughly eight miles south of the County Road 318 interchange. The driver was not seriously injured, troopers said.

Officials said the Chevy was traveling southbound in the outside lane. A female witness told authorities she was in the center lane and the pickup drove by her. The woman said that while was passing her, the driver veered for an unknown reason oto the west grassy shoulder. He tried to return to the roadway and in doing so over-corrected, which caused the vehicle to cross all three lanes. The vehicle drove onto the shoulder where the passenger side struck the guardrail.

The vehicle then made its way back onto I-75 and flipped on its roof, pinning the driver inside. Rescue officials arrived and removed the man from the vehicle.

The witness told troopers it appeared the man was speeding.",https://www.ocala.com/news/20190511/man-extricated-from-pickup-that-overturned-saturday-on-i-75?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T18:38:39Z,Ocala.com,"2121 SW 19th Avenue Rd, Ocala, FL 34471, USA"

"Florida Man Arrested For ""I EAT ASS"" Sticker Won't Be Prosecuted","This is the story of a man — a man fighting for his right to tell the world that he eats ass.

The Bonderud Law Firm / Via Facebook: bonderudlaw

A Florida man arrested this week for refusing to remove a sticker on his pickup truck proclaiming that he eats ass will not be prosecuted, officials said Thursday. Now the man is threatening to sue the sheriff's office for violating his First Amendment rights. Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was stopped Sunday on a highway in Lake City, west of Jacksonville, by a Columbia County sheriff's deputy who saw a sticker on his rear window that read, ""I EAT ASS."" Dashcam footage shows the deputy telling Webb that the reason he was pulled over was ""the derogatory sticker"" on the back of his truck. ""How is that derogatory?"" Webb asks. ""How is it not derogatory?"" the deputy responds. ""Some 10-year-old little kid sitting in the passenger seat of his momma's vehicle looks over and sees 'I EAT ASS' and asks his mom what it means; how is she going to explain that?"" ""That's the parent's job, not my job,"" Webb responded.

Webb was issued a summons for what the sheriff's deputy said was a misdemeanor violation of Florida's obscene-materials law. Dashcam footage shows the deputy telling Webb that if one of his four children asked him about the sticker, he ""would be furious."" When the deputy told Webb to remove one of the letters from the words ""ASS"" to read ""AS,"" Webb refused, citing his constitutional right to free speech. The deputy subsequently arrested Webb and charged him with the additional offense of resisting an officer without violence.

Columbia County Sheriff's Office

News of Webb's arrest — and his sticker — made news around the country. In a notice filed Thursday, prosecutors announced that they were dropping the charges against him. ""Having evaluated the evidence through the prism of Supreme Court precedent it is determined that the Defendant has a valid defense to be raised under the First Amendment of our United States Constitution,"" Assistant State's Attorney John Foster Durrett wrote. ""Given such, a jury would not convict under these facts.""

Webb's lawyer, Andrew Bonderud, told BuzzFeed News they were now considering ""a number of potential claims"" against the sheriff's office. Bonderud noted that the dashcam footage shows the deputy at first telling his client that the sticker was ""derogatory"" instead of ""offensive."" He also highlighted that at several points, one of the deputy's colleagues can be heard telling him via the radio to ""tow his shit.""

""Not only were they wrong on the law, but they happen to be hypocrites,"" he said. Bonderud said Webb's sticker ""didn't satisfy the rigorous standard to be found to be obscene,"" which he said ""typically refers to something that is erotic in nature."" ""[The 'I EAT ASS' sticker] could be a euphemism for a number of things,"" he insisted. ""The bottom line is that he and his friends thought it would be funny,"" Bonderud said, ""and he shouldn't end up in jail for making a joke like that.""

The SunSentinel reports the neighbor called 911 on Tuesday night. De Baere had blood splatters on his legs and boxer shorts. He told police he and his wife were arguing over her interactions with a former coworker.

A police report says De Baere says he took issue with “the way that she was talking to him.” When she wouldn’t stop talking, he got the gun and shot her.

Florida man who was arrested for refusing to remove vulgar sticker has charges dropped,"A Florida man who was arrested for refusing to remove a vulgar car sticker that read, “I eat a—,“ had the charges against him dropped Thursday, officials said.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida’s obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence when he refused to remove the sticker from his truck. Webb had told the Associated Press that the arresting Columbia County Sheriff’s deputy seemed angry from the beginning of the traffic stop.

“[The deputy] overstepped his boundaries by asking me to remove the sticker,” Webb told the New York Post. “I want people to see that police officers are not above the law.”

Webb was initially cited for obscenity with a notice to appear in court and was told to change the derogatory part of the sticker, but Webb refused. He was then charged with resisting and was taken to jail. He was released hours later on $2,500 bond.

Webb admitted there were limits to the First Amendment right to free speech but maintained that his sticker, which crudely described a person’s sexual appetites, was not one of them.

OLIVER SPRINGS, Tenn. (WATE) - A Tennessee man was arrested on charges he had sexual activity with a girl in Florida under the age of 12 and got her pregnant.

David Cox, 55, of Anderson County, Tenn., is charged with engaging in sexual activity with a child under the age of 12 by a family member or custodial authority.

The Gilchrist County, Florida, Sheriff's Office contacted the Anderson County Sheriff's Office last November about a possible child sex abuse case in Florida. They said the suspect was living in Oliver Springs at the time and the act allegedly happened while Cox was visiting family in Florida.

The child became pregnant shortly after the alleged abuse. Once the baby was delivered in January, DNA samples from the infant and Cox were obtained and determined to be a parental match.

The church Armstrong built all those years ago, Loving Missionary Baptist Church in Oak Cliff has been reduced to a pile of rubble.

Dallas Fire Rescue was called to the building Sunday at 4:37 a.m.

When firefighters arrived, flames were shooting through the roof, according to DFR.

Firefighters fought the fire defensively and were able to extinguish it within an hour.

The reverend said he was sleeping when he received a call about the fire.

""I just pulled up by the trash can and parked, because there was nothing I could do but look like the rest of the people. Nothing else to do,"" he said.

By morning, the church had burned to the ground, according to DFR.

""We had some good times in there,"" Armstrong said.

After four decades of sermons and celebrations, Armstrong is keeping it all in perspective.

""We thank God for what didn't happen. The building could've fell in on us when we were here on Sunday,"" he said. ""We get hung up on materialistic things and think they belong to us. You're only using them, just for a little while. When He gets ready. You'll see.""

The cause of the fire is unknown, according to DFR.

HUDSON, Fla(WFLA) -

Robert Rodriguez says he feels pretty good for his age. At 88-years old, he's still mobile and driving and active. On Thursday, he was making a trip to the Beall's store on U.S. 19 in Hudson, just north of State Road 52, when a man approached his car in the parking lot.

It was 3:19 p.m. on Thursday, in broad daylight.

""Open the door, he pulled the door,"" said Rodriguez, who had no idea he was about to become the victim of a crime. ""And put the gun down here.""

The gunman pointed the gun at Rodriguez and began to bark out orders.

""He said, get out of the car. I got out of the car. And then, give me the keys. I gave him the keys,"" said Rodriguez. ""He pushed me and that's when I fall down to the floor and got this here (points at bruise) and this down here and he just drove away.""

Pasco Deputies rushed to the scene and located Rodriguez's car less than a mile away. But there was no sign of the carjacker.

The suspect is described as either a light skinned Black male or possibly a Hispanic male, approximately 40-50 years old, around 5'6"" - 5'7"" and 160 pounds. He is clean shaven with black hair. He may possibly be known as ""Allen"" (unknown spelling).

Rodriguez is pleased he wasn't hurt worse. He still has no idea why the man picked him.

"" Why this guy picked me out, you know, I don't know. It's probably because of where I was parked,"" Rodriguez said. ""Or probably, he said this is easy prey. He's an old man. Easy prey. ""

Governor vetoes bill that would halt straw bans,"Buy Photo Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed his first bill Friday. (Photo: Tori Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat)

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has vetoed a bill that would have prevented Florida’s local governments from banning plastic straws.

DeSantis rejected the environmental regulation bill Friday, his first veto since taking office earlier this year.

The legislation originally addressed issues with contaminated recyclable materials but was amended to include a moratorium on local regulations of single-use plastic straws until 2024. A legislative analysis of the bill lists 10 Florida cities with straw bans, including Miami Beach, St. Petersburg and Fort Lauderdale.

DeSantis wrote in the veto that the bans hadn’t frustrated any state policy or harmed state interests. He says the Florida Department of Environmental Protection is encouraging residents to reduce plastic straw use. He added that residents who oppose the local bans should elect new city commissioners.

Deputies: 2 in custody after pursuit of stolen car,"Photo of car provided by Baker County Sheriff's Office on aerial from Sky 4

BALDWIN, Fla. - Two people were taken into custody Friday afternoon after a pursuit of stolen car in Northeast Florida, authorities said.

It started about 1:30 p.m. in Baker County and ended in Baldwin.

According to the Baker County Sheriff's Office, deputies were alerted to a vehicle in which the man driving assaulted a woman who was a passenger. Deputies said a witness reported the tag number of the vehicle and they learned the vehicle had been stolen from Jacksonville.

Deputies said they tried to stop the stolen vehicle, but it took off east on Interstate 10 toward Jacksonville.

During the pursuit, according to deputies, the vehicle, which appears to be a Mercedes, crashed in Baldwin and one person was taken into custody while another ran off.

The other person was eventually taken into custody with the help of a Jacksonville Sheriff's Office K-9 unit, deputies said.

The Florida Highway Patrol and CSX police were also involved in the pursuit of that person.

Romance playbook reveals social media pickup lines used in schemes are scripted,"ORLANDO, Fla. - Pages of pickup lines from what is purported to be a Nigerian “romance playbook” offers insight into

the scripted conversation young Nigerian men use to fool unsuspecting women on social media dating sites.

Diane Standish, a Central Florida widow, lost $270,000 to a man who used the photo of a foreign ambassador in a lie of love crafted with many of the same lines found in the playbook.

Standish, who filed for bankruptcy a few months ago, gave her alleged love interest her life savings. Today, she rents a room from a relative in Orlando.

The man, who claimed to be a contractor, asked her for various amounts of cash to help pay for a bogus construction project.

“Four months into it and he asked me to marry him,” she said. “ It makes me sick to my stomach.”

News 6 showed her the playbook that includes lines ranging from “Hi how was your weekend,"" to “Do you like to re-marry again?""

“I think every woman should see this, I would highly recommend it,” Standish said.

News 6 obtained the playbook from California-based Social Catfish, a high-energy group of cyberdetectives who track down the true identities of women and men claiming to want relationships on the online dating circuit.

Social Catfish CEO David McClellan said a 62-year-old woman’s poor health inspired an alleged Nigerian Romeo who goes by the name of Luke, to send the playbook to them via text.

“They’re screwing with your head,"" McClellan said. “They're pushing you to whatever it takes to give them money.”

In a Facetime interview with Social Catfish, Luke explained how he throws out a net in hopes of getting responses.

“We just send 1,000 messages, you get 100 replies,” he said.

In an email to News 6, Luke, who said his real name is Ogbama Godfrey, said he wanted to help expose the scammers but was afraid he would face arrest by U.S. authorities.

Godfrey wrote in part: “Know I’m going to be arrested after the interview, I might be used as bait for many successful scammers, it’s indeed a nice thing to see how much you want to investigate and know more about romance scam.”

According to the Federal Trade Commission, romance scams “rank number one” on total reported losses with a staggering $143 million last year.

The FTC reports the average loss per victim is about $2,600.

The catfish-style impostors use photographs lifted from legitimate social media sites such as Facebook.

Godfrey has used about a dozen different photos and admits stealing thousands of dollars from unsuspecting women.

The 22-year-old said the women are actually considered “clients” with a typical profile of: widow, divorced or depressed.

"Woman says boyfriend choked and punched her, so she stabbed him, according to ECSO","A Pensacola man was arrested after his girlfriend told investigators that he abused her throughout the day until she ultimately stabbed him in self-defense.

Calvin Williams, 50, was arrested Monday while he was still a patient at Baptist Hospital, where he was receiving treatment for a puncture wound.

He was charged with two counts of battery, false imprisonment and violation of a domestic violence injunction. His bond was set at $45,000.

According to an arrest report, the woman told deputies that Williams, her boyfriend of eight years, had physically abused her May 5. She said that despite an active domestic violence injunction stipulating that Williams have no contact with her, she allowed him to live with her to help pay rent.

The woman told deputies that around 8 p.m., she was sitting in the driver’s seat of Williams' car while he sat in the backseat directly behind her and Williams reached for her neck from behind and began choking her, the report stated.

The woman told deputies she could not talk nor breath because of his grasp, the report stated. Before he let go, Williams also punched her multiple times in the face, the woman told authorities.

Later in the evening at around 10 p.m., the woman told investigators Williams again starting punching her face while they were at home, the report stated.

The woman told deputies that she retreated to the kitchen, picked up a knife and told her boyfriend to let her leave. She said Williams blocked a doorway and her exit out of the home and refused to move.

In fear for her life, the woman said she stepped toward Williams, asked him to allow her to leave one more time and, when he refused, she stabbed the knife into his chest, according to the report.

The woman told investigators that before Williams drove away from the home, he said to her, ""B----, I can’t believe you stabbed me,"" according to the report.

Williams drove himself to West Florida Hospital’s Perdido Emergency Room on U.S. 98 before medical personnel later transported him to Baptist Hospital’s trauma unit.

Investigators observed “excessive” redness and swelling around the woman's left eye socket, bruises on her legs, a bruise on her chin and three large purplish bruises on her arm, the report stated.

JACKSONVILLE MAN HIT BY VAN: Friend witnesses incident after traffic stop,"0 Woman sees friend hit by car as he ran from police

NEPTUNE BEACH, Fla. - A Jacksonville man is being treated for critical injuries after he was hit by a van in Neptune Beach, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. His friend says she witnessed him get hit.

This incident began after Genevieve Myatt was stopped by Neptune Beach Police for speeding Thursday evening. She was pulled over on the side of Atlantic Boulevard and Florida Boulevard.

Myatt said her friend, 50-year-old Thomas Bennett, got out of her car and became upset with the officer. She told Action News Jax exclusively that watched the confrontation transpire from the driver’s seat.

“When the police officer asked him to get down, he just didn’t comply,” Myatt said. “He wasn’t listening to what they were asking him to do.”

Police said Bennett became aggressive toward the officer and ripped his own shirt off. An officer shocked him with a stun gun, but they said it did not have much effect on Bennett.

The officer then pulled out his baton but didn’t use it because Bennett darted across Atlantic Boulevard. Myatt then watched her friend get hit by an oncoming minivan.

“Once I saw that he got hit, I immediately froze. I was terrified, I was upset,” Myatt said.

FHP began investigating the crash. They said Bennett suffered critical injuries and was taken to Memorial Hospital.

Action News Jax talked to the hospital Friday morning and learned that he was still being treated in the trauma center.

“I’m praying my friend is okay,” Myatt said. “I’m hoping he’s okay.”

Action News Jax asked Myatt why she believes Bennett became upset with police. She said her friend is “protective” over her and has been “going through a lot.”

Action News Jax reached out to police to learn if Bennett could face charges, and if the officer followed protocol during this traffic stop.

'They didn't find it funny': Florida man regrets trying to pawn his baby for laughs on Snapchat,"Brian Slocum thought he had a pretty good idea for a joke.

The 43-year-old was driving down the main commercial thoroughfare in Sarasota, Florida, on Tuesday evening when he spotted A&F Pawn Jewelry and Loan, nestled in between a vape shop and a beauty salon in a shell-colored strip mall. Nabbing a prime parking spot in front of the store, he breezed past a sign warning that no one under the age of 18 would be allowed inside, and plopped his infant son, Caden, on the counter.

""This is what I got,"" he announced to the pawnshop's owner. ""I know, no one under 18 in here, but he's barely used, seven-and-a-half months old. What do you think he's worth?""

The single father figured the stunt would be prime material for the comedic Snapchat account that his nephew had recently encouraged him to start. But his attempt at dad humor went over like a ton of bricks.

Before long, Slocum learned that his face was splashed all over the local TV news and the Sarasota Police Department had asked anyone who recognized him or spotted his dark blue Nissan to call 911. As it turned out, the pawnshop had taken his questions about whether it was possible to pawn a baby completely seriously, and handed authorities surveillance footage that showed Slocum, clad in cargo shorts and a blue baseball cap advertising Corona beer, offering up a wide-eyed infant to a complete stranger.

""This is not funny!"" Richard Jordan, the store's owner, told WFLA after he learned the truth, his eyes flaring with disgust. ""This is not funny, this is serious business.""

The new father was hardly the first to underestimate the stakes of what was supposed to be a harmless joke. Other pranksters have wound up injured or in jail as a result of poorly conceived stunts that they cooked up in hopes of going viral, from the man who had to be rescued by firefighters after he cemented his head in a microwave to the YouTuber who was escorted out of his home in handcuffs after he decided it would be funny to film himself taking down stop signs.

Slocum, who got off relatively easy by comparison, had similarly thought of his stunt as lighthearted fodder for social media. Unbeknownst to the store clerk, he had surreptitiously been recording their exchange with his cellphone, and had anticipated that the man would get the joke and run with it.

""I was thinking I'd go in there and the guy would be like, 'Oh, if it was my son, I'd give you ten grand,' or something,"" Slocum later explained to WFLA. In the Snapchat videos that he provided to the station, he can be heard telling the clerk that he only wanted the boy to be held as collateral: ""Just pawn, I don't want to get rid of him.""

Instead, his cavalier attitude toward the small boy in striped footie pajamas, who stamped his feet with obvious relish as he waited to learn his fate, set off alarm bells.

""It was the weirdest, strangest situation we've ever encountered,"" Jordan told WFLA. ""He put it on the counter, he was pretty serious about it. He spun the baby around, and said, 'Can I pawn this?' ""

Stunned to the point of speechlessness, Jordan didn't respond. With a nod of resignation, Slocum hoisted the baby's car seat back up off the counter.

""I just need a babysitter for like two weeks,"" he reportedly complained as he left the store with his son in tow.

After the door slammed shut, the clerk picked up the phone to notify authorities that he was worried about the child's safety. Equally alarmed, officers began using ""vast resources"" to track down the identity of the strange man who had asked about the retail value of a baby, a Wednesday statement from the Sarasota Police Department said. In an alert that was shared with the public on Tuesday night, police noted that they had no idea if he was even related to the infant that he had apparently been willing to treat like a flat-screen television or used guitar.

""They didn't find it funny or hilarious at all and there was a lot of resources and time and money that went into it,"" Slocum shamefacedly acknowledged in a Wednesday interview with WFLA.

Just hours after he pulled out of the pawnshop's parking lot, the lanky, lightly-bearded father was shocked to discover that law enforcement was searching for him, and it was all over the evening news. He called police to explain that the ""suspicious incident"" had actually been a prank intended for social media clout. Before long, he told WFLA, dozens of officers had surrounded his home.

Eventually, the officers confirmed that little Caden was safe and in no danger of being sold to a pawnbroker. Police announced Wednesday that they had contacted the Florida Department of Children and Families as a standard part of their investigation, but found no reason to press charges against the boy's father. Making terrible dad jokes, it turns out, isn't considered a crime.

Sitting on his porch later that day, Slocum told WFLA that he was very sorry for all the trouble that he had caused, and had learned his lesson. He warned other aspiring comedians not to make the same mistake.

""A lot of these young people don't realize that doing things like this has a consequence,"" he told the station, dressed in a T-shirt that proudly spelled out the letters ""D-A-D"" in bold capital letters across his chest.

""There's nothing in the world I would trade for my son,"" he added. ""He's my world.""

The boy bounced in his rocker and emitted delighted screams. ""How could you want to get rid of that?"" Slocum asked.",https://www.fayobserver.com/news/20190510/they-didnt-find-it-funny-florida-man-regrets-trying-to-pawn-his-baby-for-laughs-on-snapchat?rssfeed=true,2019-05-10T12:50:59Z,The Fayetteville Observer,"458 Whitfield St, Fayetteville, NC 28306, USA"
Fort Myers man found guilty of lewd conduct against 9-year-old girl,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Lee County on news-press.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

A Fort Myers man faces up to 60 years in prison after a jury convicted him this week of lewd conduct against a 9-year-old.

According to a news release from the 20th Judicial Circuit, Ricky Tolbert, 46, molested a girl while he was working at R&R Barber Shop in January 2018.

The Office of the State's Attorney release identified him as a habitual offender. Sentencing is June 4. He was convicted of two counts of lewd or lascivious conduct during a three-day trial.

According to a police report, Tolbert would play with children who came into the shop with their parents. In one instance, he lured a 9-year-old child into the back room to play hide and seek and turned off the lights. The child sat on his lap.

The child told police that she felt his penis on her buttocks and thought he had exposed it, but she never saw it, the police report indicated. The girl remained dressed. When an adult returned to the store, Tolbert stood, faced away from her and made a motion like he was zipping his pants.

The child told her mother the next day, who contacted the Fort Myers Police Department.

Police subsequently discovered another child the defendant committed lewd acts on between 2016 and 2017, also at the barber shop, the release stated.

A third victim who experienced similar lewd touching from the defendant in 2010 testified at the recent trial, the release noted.

She is now an adult and testified that Tolbert committed the acts upon her at a different barbershop in Fort Myers. Tolbert was prosecuted for abusing that victim in a separate case, the release noted.

Assistant State Attorney Michael Colombo Jr. handled the prosecution.

Man arrested in 1985 killing of Hollywood TV director Barry Crane,"Advertisement Man arrested in 1985 killing of Hollywood TV director Barry Crane Share Shares Copy Link Copy

A man charged with bludgeoning and strangling to death a Hollywood television director more than three decades ago was arrested Thursday in North Carolina after police said DNA and a confession linked him to the crime.Edwin Hiatt was arrested in Burke County for the 1985 death of Barry Crane in Los Angeles. He has been charged with murder in California and will be returned there, Los Angeles police announced.A housekeeper found Crane, 57, dead in his garage in his Studio City townhouse on July 5, 1985. He was naked and had been wrapped in bedsheets. He had been beaten with a large ceramic statue and strangled with a telephone cord, the News Herald of Morgantown, North Carolina reported, citing court documents.Crane directed dozens of episodes of such hit 1970s and ’80s TV shows as “The Incredible Hulk, “Hawaii 5-O” and “The Six Million Dollar Man.” He also produced the show “The Magician” and was associate producer for “Mannix” and “Mission: Impossible.”He also was a world-class bridge player.There was no word on a motive for the killing.Crane’s death went unsolved until police said they matched a fingerprint from Crane’s stolen car to Hiatt last year. FBI investigators then obtained discarded cigarette butts and a coffee cup from the parking lot of the auto repair shop in Burke County where Hiatt worked.DNA from some items matched that from cigarette butts found in Crane’s stolen car, which was discovered shortly after his death on a mountain road, investigators said.On March 8, homicide detectives went to North Carolina to interview Hiatt.“During the interview, Hiatt admitted to killing Barry Crane,” an LAPD statement said.It wasn’t known whether Hiatt had a lawyer.Video from WSOC-TV showed Hiatt, 52, of Connelly Springs, being arrested. Hiatt, with long white hair and beard, held his handcuffed hands in front of him as he was taken to a car.Hiatt told the station that he didn’t remember Crane’s name until it was told to him and had no memory of what occurred so long ago except for “bits and pieces that were brought back to me just by suggestion.”Asked if he could have killed Crane, he replied: “Anything’s possible back then ... I was big into drugs.”“I just don’t want to remember the past,” he said, adding later: “It’s a different life today.”Co-workers told the News Herald that Hiatt was a generous and peaceful man.“He wouldn’t hurt a flea,” Dee Hall said.“This is something that supposedly happened 30 years ago, the man’s changed,” Hall said. “Christ has come in and he’s become a new creature. If God’s forgiven you, you’re forgiven. That’s it.”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/man-arrested-in-1985-killing-of-hollywood-tv-director-barry-crane/27428949,2019-05-10T09:42:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA"

"Florida Man says attempt to pawn real baby was a ""prank""","(WFLA/NBC News) A Florida man who triggered a manhunt when he attempted to pawn his baby says his actions were a prank for Snapchat.

On Tuesday evening a man entered the A&F Pawn shop in Sarasota and made a strange request to store owner Richard Jordan.

""The weirdest, strangest situation we've ever encountered,"" said Jordan. ""He put it on the counter, he was pretty serious about it. He spun the baby around, and said 'Can I pawn this?'"".

It lasted less than a minute, but after the man left Jordan called the police.

A few hours later, Brian Slocum realized he was all over the news. He called authorities to explain and soon dozens of officers were outside his home.

Charges dropped against Florida man arrested for 'obscene' sticker,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Charges have been dropped against a Lake City man who was arrested for having a window sticker on the rear window of his truck that deputies with the Columbia County Sheriff's Office said violated Florida's obscenity law.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence, a Columbia County Sheriff's Office report said. Webb was released on a $2,500 bond.

In a filing from the State Attorney's Office, prosecutors told the court the charges were being dropped against Webb.

The Bonderud Law Firm of Jacksonville, which is representing Webb, released the following statement on Facebook, which includes the the filing from the State Attorney's Office:

A deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a vehicle sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite, the sheriff's report said. When told about the reason for the stop, Webb reportedly said, ""They're just words.""

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court, the report said. The deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused.

Webb said he wasn't even of the state's obscenity law, but after reviewing it since his arrest, he said it needs to be changed.

Prosecutor: Dogs detected decomposition in Houston missing girl case,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (Photos: Houston Police)

HOUSTON (AP) — Trained dogs detected the scent of human decomposition in the vehicle of a man arrested in connection with the disappearance of a 4-year-old Texas girl, according to a prosecutor.

Derion Vence, 26, remained jailed Sunday on a $1 million bond after being arrested a day earlier on a charge of tampering evidence, specifically a human corpse. His next court appearance is set for Monday.

Houston police said investigators have not found Maleah Davis and the investigation is continuing. Authorities have declined to say whether they believe Vence killed Maleah. But prosecutors said in court documents filed Saturday that Vence could face additional charges, including murder.

The investigation began after Vence told police that men in a truck on May 4 had abducted him, Maleah and his 2-year-old son a day earlier, but had freed him and the boy. Vence told investigators he was left in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land and walked to a hospital, where he reported the girl's abduction.

Sugar Land police, who initially interviewed him, said his story kept changing and didn't add up.

Vence, who had lived with Maleah and her mother, reported that his silver Nissan Altima was taken in the abduction, but surveillance video showed that vehicle was used to drop Vence off at the hospital. Police found the car Thursday.

Dogs trained to find cadavers reacted to the trunk of the car, Pat Stayton, a prosecutor with the Harris County District Attorney's Office, said at Vence's probable cause court hearing Saturday night.

Surveillance video from a neighbor showed Vence carrying a large, blue laundry basket with a large trash bag from his apartment on May 3, Stayton said. Vence returned three minutes later without the basket and later he was seen leaving the apartment with cleaning supplies, including bleach.

In the silver Nissan, police found a laundry basket that looked like the one Vence took out of his apartment, Stayton said.

""Both of the dogs reacted to the trunk of the silver Nissan that the defendant had driven and that the blue laundry basket was recovered from, indicating that the dogs were responding to the scent of human decomposition in the vehicle,"" Stayton said.

Investigators also found blood at the apartment, both in the hallway leading to the bathroom and on surfaces inside the bathroom, Stayton said.

At Saturday night's hearing, Vence said he planned to hire a defense attorney.

Rodney Brown, an attorney appointed to represent Vence only for Saturday's hearing, had asked a magistrate judge to set bond at $5,000, saying Vence was a low flight risk and had lived in Houston most of his life.

Stayton argued that Vence was a flight risk and there was ""evidence of deception on the part of the defendant with regard to information he gave to police.""

Police have described Vence as Maleah's stepfather, but Maleah's mother, Brittany Bowens, said through a spokesman that Vence is her former fiance. Quanell X, a local civil rights activist who spoke to reporters on Bowens' behalf on Friday, also said that Vence had abused Maleah.

Child Protective Services removed Maleah and her brothers from the home Vence and Bowens shared in August after the girl suffered a head wound, but the children were returned in February, according to an agency spokeswoman.",https://www.wfla.com/national/prosecutor-dogs-detected-decomposition-in-houston-missing-girl-case/1997828304,2019-05-12T18:21:16Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"
Theodore Decker: Marsha Corbett 'working the handles and the brake' on family roller coaster,"Margaret ""Peg"" Corbett was a woman of routine.

On Mondays she did the laundry. Tuesdays, the ironing. Wednesdays, general housecleaning.

On Thursdays she got her hair done.

So that's what she did on June 5, 2014. Then she and her husband, Donald, left their home in Canal Winchester for the short drive north to an early dinner at a Pickerington pizzeria. Coming in the opposite direction, a young man with a history of erratic driving crossed the center line.

""Within five minutes of home, boom, end of story,"" said Don Corbett, one of the couple's sons.

The crash left his father disabled and ended his mother's life. But it was not the end of the story.

That is still being written. The setting has changed from central Ohio to southwest Florida. The characters are found in any family: mothers, daughters, sons, in-laws. The theme might be love, and how it can deepen amid loss.

As Corbett tells it, this is about the woman who kept it all together.

""It's been a roller-coaster ride, and she's been the person working the handles and the brake,"" he said.

Corbett, 60, labels himself ""a beat-up old Irish cop.""

He grew up near Youngstown. One day as he sat with a buddy in the Austintown Fitch High School cafeteria, a girl named Marsha walked up and advised that he was sitting in her usual seat. Corbett replied as any teenage boy trying to play it cool would, saying something along the lines of, I don't see your name on it.

""You don't move and I'm going to sit on your lap,"" Marsha said.

He didn't. So she did.

""That shows you how strong-willed she is,"" he said.

They married a few years out of high school. Corbett became a police officer in Austintown and retired after 20 years. When their three children were in high school, he and Marsha moved to Columbus.

Eventually, Corbett's parents followed. So did his older brother, Tom, who had worked in the Lordstown GM plant for 30 years. He had never married or lived outside his parents' home, and he was especially close with their mother.

Her death devastated them all. Don Corbett had to inform his father, also named Donald, that she had died.

""Not Peg,"" was all his father said.

The younger Corbett had made death notifications throughout his police career; this one plunged him into depression. His wife stepped up.

""From that point, she was the victim's advocate, the counselor, she did everything,"" Corbett said. ""The funeral arrangements, the ordering of flowers. She was like a jack of all trades.""

Time passed. Friends stopped coming with casseroles. The case against the other driver dragged on, finally ending in a prison sentence.

Marsha Corbett kept going. Day after day, she looked after her father-in-law and her brother-in-law, who eventually was diagnosed with advanced Parkinson's disease. When they decided to move to Florida, it was Marsha who sold both of their condominiums.

Her own mother passed away. She kept going.

""I see it and watch it like a reality show every day, how she reacts to things, the way that she treats my father, the way that she treats my brother,"" Don Corbett said. ""She does things that I rarely see or hear people do.

""Here we are, five years later. My wife took over for my mother.""

If their own golden years haven't turned out as they'd once planned, if looking after three ornery old Irishmen sometimes wears on her nerves, Marsha doesn't let on. She runs the household with the same efficiency as her mother-in-law did. Say, for instance, her husband rolls out of bed in the morning and visits the bathroom.

""I come back … the bed's made,"" he said, laughing.

Don and Marsha Corbett have been together since they were kids. Through the years he has bought her all the flowers and jewelry that fit within a cop's salary and pension.

When you're this lucky for this long, Don thought, you shout it from the mountaintops. But there are no mountaintops in southwest Florida, or in central Ohio, for that matter.

So you look for a megaphone, ask a favor of your old town's newspaper.

KANSAS CITY, Kan. – Alva native Ross Chastain raced to his first NASCAR Trucks victory Friday night after leader Stewart Friesen ran out of gas with three laps to go at the Digital Ally 250 NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series race at the Kansas Speedway.

“This is what sports is all about – comebacks man,” Chastain said after leading just five laps.

Friesen took the first two stages for the first time this season, but a costly mistake of leaving the pit box early with 42 laps to go left him without enough gas. He held the lead after a restart with 16 laps to go and led a race-high 87 laps on the 1 1/2-mile oval, but ended up 15th.

“We just can’t close it,” said Friesen, who was seeking his first Trucks win after five runner-up finishes. “I didn’t know we were taking four (tires). I thought for sure we were taking two. Just a lot of silence on the radio. That’s it.”

The winner of a NASCAR Xfinity Series race last year in Las Vegas, Chastain topped Ben Rhodes by 0.483 seconds. Chastain had earned a full-time ride in Ganassi’s No. 42 Xfinity Series Chevrolet for 2019, but that ride went away following an FBI raid on the program’s primary sponsor, DC Solar.

It's the Riverdale High graduate's first Trucks series victory in his 66th start and the first for Niece Motorsports. He's also the only driver to start the Trucks season with seven straight Top-10 finishes.

“Aw, man, this is what sports is all about,” Chastain told nascar.com, barely able to contain his emotions. “We had the world by the tail last fall, and everything got taken away from us. We didn’t quit, though … I’m going to celebrate this one a lot more than I did the last one.

“I thought, after the last one (in Las Vegas), they were going to come a lot more easy. But it’s not easy … I hate to see Stewie lose one like that. I know he’s been trying to win, but, yes — we got it!”

Todd Gilliland was third, followed by Austin Hill and Brandon Jones and two-time Kansas winner Matt Crafton. Johnny Sauter, coming off a victory at Dover, was forced to the garage after his 20th lap because of mechanical woes and came back to complete 97 laps.",http://rssfeeds.news-press.com/~/601862800/0/ftmyers/home~Alvaaposs-Ross-Chastain-wins-first-career-NASCAR-Trucks-series-race/,2019-05-11T13:10:54Z,The News-Press,"2442 Dr Martin Luther King Jr Blvd, Fort Myers, FL 33901, USA"

Two people surrender to police after standoff on West Lloyd Street,"CLOSE A SWAT team begins to move toward a home on West Lloyd Street where a man allegedly fired shots. Colin Warren-Hicks, Pensacola

Two people surrendered to authorities Friday after a more than two-hour standoff with law enforcement at a home on West Lloyd Street where a person had barricaded themselves inside.

One man and one woman were taken into police custody. As of 5 p.m. Friday, authorities had not released their names or announced charges against them.

The two people surrendered shortly before noon after the SWAT team, carrying AR-15 assault rifles and at least one shotgun, approached the home.

Shots were fired at 9:31 a.m. in the backyard of the house at 1101 W. Lloyd St. and law enforcement was notified a minute later, according to Pensacola Police Department spokesman Mike Wood.

Officers arrived at the house at 9:34 a.m., at which time, the person who had fired the shots had retreated inside and barricaded themselves inside the home, Wood said.

By 9:50 a.m., officers had encircled the house near the corner of Lloyd and G streets and closed streets within a one-block radius of the intersection to both car and pedestrian traffic. All neighbors were advised to take shelter.

Officers attempted to contact the person inside the home via megaphone, a house phone line and cellphones to no avail, Wood said. A warning over the megaphone stated that a SWAT team was en route, but no one inside the home responded, according to authorities.

Isaiah Henry, 40, of Pensacola, was riding his bike north on H Street around 9:45 a.m. when he encountered one of the roadblocks around West Lloyd Street.

""I've lived here all my life and seen a lot of crazy stuff, but this really tops it all,"" he said. ""This is a quiet neighborhood.""

Henry said he has a child who lives several blocks away with their mother.

""It’s really shocking, really. Other than the regular traffic stop, you really don’t see this type of thing around here,” Henry said, gesturing toward a scene of law enforcement cruisers, trucks, crime scene tape and busy investigators.

Nearby, one school had been placed on lockdown.

All teachers and children at the A.A. Dixon Early Head Start Center at 1201 North H St. were forced to remain in their classrooms until the standoff ended, according to the school’s social services advocate.

The school is approximately two blocks from 1101 W. Lloyd St. and was less than 200 yards from the police’s mobile command center. Escambia County School District Superintendent Malcolm Thomas confirmed no other schools went on lockdown due to Friday’s incident.

Emergency response vehicles continued to arrive throughout the morning as police parked SUVs with flashing lights in the center of streets, further fortifying their roadblocks.

By 11 a.m., the SWAT team arrived and began to assemble a block away from the barricaded home. Shortly after 11:45 a.m., SWAT members wearing body armor moved as a unit down the street.

By 11:56 a.m., police announced two suspects had surrendered to authorities. Following standard protocol, SWAT cleared the house. The team checked for additional suspects but found none.

""The house has been cleared. It is all over,"" Wood said at 12:02 p.m.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - A man who was performing on stage with his band during a shooting Wednesday night at Blue Martini in Fort Lauderdale said he helped disarm the shooter.

Julian Vazquez was on stage with Eddie Bustamante and his bandmates from the Clique when shots were fired shortly before midnight inside the bar at the upscale Galleria mall.

One man was killed and two others were wounded in the shooting.

Fort Lauderdale police said Arnold Person, 43, of Miami, was pronounced dead at the scene. He would have turned 44 on Thursday.

Two other victims were taken to Broward Health Medical Center.

Vazquez told Local 10 News he saw the altercation that led to the shooting and believes the gunman had the victim in a headlock when he died.

""I believe the brother of the victim, he was pummeling the shooter, or one of the shooters,"" Vazquez recalled. ""And he loosened the gun from him, and me and another guy got the gun out. I pulled the clip out and took a bullet out of the chamber.""

Family members of the victims gathered at the hospital, telling Local 10 News they had been at Blue Martini for a celebration of life for a relative who recently died. They said someone bumped another person, prompting the fight.

Bustamante said chaos ensued after the shooting, with people jumping over tables and running to get away.

""We just collectively knew we needed to get out of there as soon as possible,"" he said.

Police said one person was taken into custody for questioning, but no arrests have been made.

Man faces attempted murder charge in Nassau County shooting,"FERNANDINA BEACH, Fla. - A North Carolina man wanted in connection with a March shooting in Amelia Island has been taken into custody, according to the Nassau County Sheriff’s Office.

Christian Edwards, 21, was arrested last week in St. Pauls, North Carolina, on a warrant charging him with attempted murder and armed robbery and returned to Nassau County on Wednesday.

Edwards is suspected in the March 31 shooting of a 20-year-old man who showed up at Baptist Medical Center Nassau about 3 p.m. that day with a gunshot wound to the leg.

The unnamed victim was later airlifted to UF Health Jacksonville with serious injuries. His condition wasn’t immediately known Thursday morning.

A warrant was issued for Edwards’ arrest after investigators received information about the shooting, which unfolded near a home on Friendly Road off State Road 200 in Fernandina Beach, deputies said.

Deputies said a witness saw two men then heard gunfire near the home where the shooting happened March 31. Shortly after, the same witness recalled seeing two vehicles drive away from the scene.

The incident remains under investigation.

"Florida man buys billboard, hopes to land dream job at Disney","How far would you go for the job of your dreams? For one Central Florida man, the sky (or close to it) was the limit

Brandon Fox had to get creative in order to get the attention of Disney’s HR department.

""I can’t imagine how many résumé Disney gets every day. I just wanted to think of a way to show that I’m not just a piece of paper, and that I needed to stand out somehow,"" he told WKMG Orlando.

Man Applies for Job at Walt Disney World… on a Billboard. Do you think it will work?https://t.co/sFdajpU6UZpic.twitter.com/8mbV8hA6EH

— The Disney Blog (@TheDisneyBlog)May 7, 2019

The billboard along State Road 535 reads, “Dear Walt Disney World Executives and HR, experienced EA/PA Professional seeking position as a WDW Assistant.""

It also provides his phone number and an email address, not to mention a hashtag to stay on par with these social times.

So how much did the billboard résumé set Fox back? ""I don’t want to say that because I don’t want my wife to divorce me. It’s worth it,"" he told WKMG.

And it kind of worked. A spokesperson for Walt Disney World released the following statement: ""We appreciate the creativity and encourage anyone interested in a role with us to apply at disneycareers.com.”

Fox isn’t the only Florida man using a billboard to get his message across.

Earlier this year, two Florida brothers used the old school advertising platform to wish their dad a happy birthday -- them and the 20,000 other people who texted him after driving by the public display of affection.

U.S. Navy test of unarmed Trident missile off Cape Canaveral deemed successful as North Korea carries out tests of its own,"An unarmed Trident II D5 missile was launched off the coast of Cape Canaveral on May 9. The test launch was part of the U.S. Navy Strategic Systems Programs' demonstration. (Photo: John Kowalski, U.S. Navy)

The U.S. Navy successfully tested an unarmed Trident II D5 missile off the coast of Cape Canaveral last week, even as North Korea carried out its own short-range missile launches the same day.

The Trident II D5 – an intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of just over 1,200 miles – was launched Thursday from the USS Rhode Island with coordination with the U.S. Navy's Strategic Systems Programs.

The launch came the same day the U.S. conducted another ICBM test in California. An unarmed Minuteman III missile was launched as part of an operational test north of Vandenberg Air Force Base, according to U.S. Strategic Command in Nebraska.

The launch off Cape Canaveral was the 172nd successful test flight of the solid-fuel, three-stage Trident II D5 missile, which can carry up to 12 warheads. The purpose of the offshore test on May 9 was to test the readiness of the weapon system, which can be used to deliver nuclear-tipped warheads as part of the U.S.’ strike capability.

“I’m incredibly proud of Team King’s Bay and the Rhode Island crew. They’ve spent the last nine months preparing for this test and the patrols that will follow. Because of their hard work and dedication, our sea-based deterrent remains the most survivable and reliable in the world,” said Rear Adm. Michael Bernacchi, Commander, Submarine Group 10, in a statement issued Thursday.

The launch off Cape Canaveral – one of a number that have taken place in the area over the years – came shortly after North Korea was reported to have launched two short-range missiles of its own, alarming its regional neighbors just weeks after failed talks between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in March, according to media reports.

“While we’ve demonstrated today that our efforts to extend the life of our existing D5 missiles and SSBNs are successful, it is imperative that we remain focused on the Navy’s number one priority: on-time delivery of the first Colombia-class submarine,” said Behning in the statement.

The USS Rhode Island Rhode Island, an Ohio-class submarine is one of five ballistic-missile submarines homeported at Kings Bay, Georgia.

"A Cape Coral mother will spend Mother's Day by newborn's bedside in hospital, hoping for good news","This year, Mother's Day won't mean as much to Kathryn Zarrillo as Tuesday will.

For most others, the 14th will be just like any other regular day of the week. But for Zarrillo, it means finding out whether she can take her newborn son home after an extended hospital stay that kept them from their family in Cape Coral for nearly a month.

Zarrillo hasn't been able to return to her teaching job since her son's birth, and her husband has been working overtime for the city of Cape Coral to support their family while she stays with the baby at Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Hollywood, Florida. Their daughter, Liliana, has been at home with her father.

""Hopefully, we'll be getting some answers on Tuesday,"" Zarrillo said over the phone from the hospital room, where she spends every day and night by her baby's bedside.

Canio Zarrillo was born six weeks premature on Jan. 19. He had been diagnosed with a genetic disorder called Noonan syndrome prior to his birth, so Zarrillo knew he might come early.

""But it was still a complete surprise,"" Zarrillo said. ""One minute I'm laying my daughter down to bed. The next minute, I'm like 'oh, my water broke'.""

Since then, the mom and son have been in and out of hospitals, sometimes for extended stays and other times for follow-up treatments.

They had their first fun outing about a month ago, when they went to their friend's home for a pre-Easter egg hunt.

""Everything was fun. Everyone looked cute,"" Zarrillo said. ""We took some cute pictures.""

The next day, after feeding from a bottle in the morning – ""a big deal for Canio to have a bottle,"" Zarillo said – his breathing started to grow labored.

Then it stopped. His heart soon would follow suit.

The family rushed the baby to Golisano Children's Hospital of Southwest Florida, a 20-minute drive from their Cape Coral home.

""By the time we got there, he was already turning blue,"" Zarrillo said. ""That's where our journey really started. His first few months of life have just been crazy. It's been a lot for my little man.""

Noonan syndrome is a condition that affects many areas of the body. It is characterized by mildly unusual facial features, short stature, heart defects, bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and many other signs and symptoms, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

For Canio, the disorder has caused heart problems and unusual facial features.

When he went into cardiac arrest in mid-April, his heart's left ventricle collapsed. Doctors had to pump him full of fluid to get his heart beating the way it should, Zarrillo said.

Then Canio's body started retaining fluid, and tests indicated lymphatic problems.

""My little 9-pound son turned into at least double his size, if not triple within a matter of a day,"" she said.

They spent 10 days at the Southwest Florida hospital. On April 24, patches of Canio's skin started turning purple, Zarrillo said.

Doctors transferred him to the children's hospital on the east coast via a med flight. He's improved since then, achieving more normal fluid levels.

But the distance has been tough on the family, and especially on Zarrillo's daughter Liliana, who turns 3 next month, she said. The little girl wanted to hold her baby brother all the time when Zarrillo first brought him home, she said.

""What do you tell an almost 3-year-old that her little brother isn't home because there's something wrong with him?"" Zarrillo asked. ""We tell her he's at the hospital getting strong, but she can't go see him because she's too little.""

Zarrillo hasn't seen Liliana since April 24, she said.

""Not being able to see my little girl for so long has really pulled on my heart so much,"" Zarrillo said. ""This has been a big wait-and-see game. The waiting and the seeing is very, very, very, very draining. I can’t do anything except for hope the doctors are doing the best thing for my son.""

There is some light at the tunnel, she said.

She'll return home and back to work for the last day of school, where she'll see her fifth graders off as they prepare to transition into middle school, she said. And she'll plan a small birthday party for Liliana, with Minnie Mouse cupcakes.

A friend has set up a GoFundMe page to help the family with the mounting expenses as her husband works overtime to support the family on one salary.

And she keeps her favorite picture of Canio, taken the day before they went to the emergency room, hanging in his hospital room so everyone can see what he looked like before all the feeding tubes, fluid retention and skin discoloration. Zarrillo said the picture shows what ""normal"" looks like for him.

""We take each day as it comes. Some days we take each hour as it comes,"" Zarrillo said. ""Sometimes you've just got to take what you can when you can take it and be grateful for every little minute, because they count.""

Ride along with Miami Gardens Police Department's bike unit,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - On a steamy night in late April, Miami Gardens police officers on bicycle patrol were heading to reports of a shooting, when they heard a house alarm blaring.

At Northwest 196th Lane and 33rd Court, officers dismounted, drew their weapons, and surrounded the house.

A neighbor told officers he saw a man trying to break into his house, so they suspected a criminal could be inside this adjacent one, too.

After a police K-9 was called to clear the home, it was determined the suspected burglar was gone. The homeowners arrived, relieved that officers had responded to the house so quickly.

That was just another night for the bike unit, which some Miami Gardens residents said they never even knew about.

It’s a team of cops on two wheels that saturates areas after crimes are committed, and patrols areas during the day to get to know the neighbors.

According to Capt. Joseph Nargiso, there are 64 bike-certified officers in the department. Their goal is very different than of those who work road patrol or undercover details.

“It's totally opposite. What we do here is we're very visible with the community,” Nargiso said.

Occasionally Chief Delma Noel-Pratt gears up to ride, too.

“When we're on our bikes, it's open air. We get to see people closer. Face to face,” she said.

Miami Gardens crime has made headlines in the last several weeks.

There have been two fatal shootings this week alone. A toddler was reported attacked and beaten inside a recycling bin the week before.

And there have been two high-profile homicides, including that of well-known grandmother Danette Simmons. A suspect who lives nearby was recently arrested.

FDLE records show overall crime has increased in the city from 2016 to 2017, and again in 2018. More recent numbers for the last half of 2018 and 2019 were not yet available from the state.

Byron Johnson, who normally rides with the motorcycle unit but is also bicycle-certified, said he prefers to be on two wheels to be more visible. He thinks he can make a better connection with people in the community in order to fight crime.

He likes that people can see his face.

""If the people in the community don't know who you are, how can you expect them to come tell you anything?"" he said.

About 50 people gathered at a Treasure Coast softball field Friday night to remember a 16-year-old girl.Layne Chesney was horribly burned in a fire in Fort Pierce on New Year’s Eve, 2017.She spent about a year in a hospital in Miami before transferring to a facility in Texas.She died Friday.“It didn’t matter how close you were with Layne, she made an impact on your life,” said a friend at the vigil Friday night.Layne was an avid softball player.The fields at Pineapple Park in Jensen Beach were considered her home away from home.That’s where her friends gathered to honor her.“She was a light,” another friend said. “She was always happy. But man, was that girl fierce.”Friends talked about Layne’s positive personality, how she was always happy and could always make someone laugh.“Layne was a light. Our world is darker without her,” a friend said.Each person at the vigil placed an electronic light on a table near a photo of Layne.They talked about her determination and how hard she fought to survive her injuries.“We will all miss her.

Police capture Alabama murder suspect in Jacksonville Beach,"JACKSONVILLE BEACH, Fla. - A man wanted in connection with an Alabama murder case was taken into custody Thursday afternoon in Jacksonville Beach, authorities said.

Lucas Ray Kemp, 18, of Huntsville, Alabama, was among three people detained about 12:45 p.m. at the beach near 1st Street South, according to the Jacksonville Beach Police Department.

Of the three, Kemp was the only individual arrested as there was an active warrant out for his arrest stemming from an unspecified murder and burglary in Madison, Alabama, a suburb of Huntsville.

The two others detained by police were questioned and released once local investigators learned that they were viewed as witnesses in the Alabama case, the police department stated in a news release.

Officers were alerted to Kemp’s presence after a pickup truck sought by investigators in Madison was found parked in the area, the release said. Shortly afterward, Kemp was taken into custody nearby.

Sgt. Larry Smith said Thursday's arrest was a great example of how technology can help police.

""The license plate readers in our surrounding jurisdictions alerted us to the vehicle being in our area. Subsequently, leading to the arrest of an out of state murder suspect,"" Smith said.

Kemp was taken to the Duval County jail, where he remains in custody on a warrant as a fugitive from justice, jail logs show. It’s unclear when he’ll be extradited back to Alabama.

A child abuser faked a Golden Gate Bridge suicide; the three-year manhunt ended in Key West,"The tripped alarm triggered a call to police. It was last Friday, around 1:30 a.m., just outside Key West, Florida. Deputies from the Monroe County Sheriff's Office pulled onto Shrimp Road, a sweaty strip of broken concrete on Stock Island where a large hangar-like industrial building squatted across from a canal.

As the sheriff's office detailed in a recent news release, the deputies picking through the property discovered an unlocked storage trailer sitting off to the side of the main building. A man - his short light hair messed up, his face charred red from the sun and dotted with small cuts - was living inside.

He told the Monroe deputies his name was William Wallace Littlejohn. He said he had no identification. No record came back when the deputies punched his name into the system. They were dealing with a mystery man.

Searching through the trailer, the deputies discovered a military contractor ID card in the name William W. Littlejohn. They also found checks written out in the name, as well as a U.S. passport. The deputies, however, felt the documentation was fake. When they ran the details through a U.S. Border Patrol system, Littlejohn turned out to be a man living in Utah.

The individual from the trailer refused to speak to deputies, and he was booked into the local jail as ""John Doe,"" held on suspicion of giving police a false name.

Palm-shaded and joyfully beer-sloshed, Key West's debauched reputation as a Tommy Bahama-clad vacation destination runs parallel to another identity as the perfect place to lay low. As the southernmost point in the continental United States, the Florida Keys have been longtime safe havens for drifters, burnouts, fugitives and anyone eager to live as far off the grid as possible.

But the man from the trailer did not remain a John Doe for long. Running his fingerprints, Monroe County deputies learned he had been wanted by the U.S. Marshals Service for the last three years - in reality, he was 58-year-old Michael Patrick Manning.

In 2015, Manning had been charged in California with both sexually abusing a minor under the age of 14 and creating child pornography. But he had slipped away from authorities the next year after elaborately staging a suicide at the Golden Gate Bridge, more than 3,200 miles from the trailer where he was recently discovered.

Manning's problems with the law began when he was living in Chico, Calif., a Central Valley city of around 112,000 north of Sacramento. In 2015, the local police department began investigating him after a young woman said she had been sexually assaulted by Manning in 2008 and 2009, when she was between 12 to 14 years old, according to a recent news release from the Chico Police Department.

On Sept. 3, 2015, Manning was arrested on "" multiple counts of lewd and lascivious acts with a minor under the age of 14,"" the Chico Enterprise-Record reported at the time.

During his arrest, police searched his home. According to the Enterprise-Record, investigators discovered more than 600 images of child pornography at the residence. He was later charged with possessing and manufacturing child pornography, the Chico police news release said. He posted a $215,000 bail and was released from jail.

More than a year later, in June 2016, Manning pleaded no contest to the charges he faced, including oral copulation of a person under 14, possession of more than 600 images of child/youth pornography, and two counts of solicitation of a minor to engage in the preparation of sexual images, the Enterprise-Record reported. His sentencing date in Butte County Superior Court was scheduled for Oct. 6, 2016.

Manning was a no-show at his court date.

The next day, about a three-hour drive south of Chico in San Francisco, members of the National Park Service discovered an abandoned car near the Golden Gate Bridge, according to the Chico police release. The car was a rental taken out in Manning's name. Inside, they discovered a suicide note in the wanted man's handwriting.

Authorities did not buy the scenario. A search turned up no body. So police tapped the FBI and the Marshals Service Fugitive Task Force to help track down Manning. According to the release from Chico law enforcement, the hunt hopscotched across California - Yuba City, Sacramento, San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland and Alameda.

Investigators believed a ""close associate"" of Manning was helping the fugitive slip away. This same associate ""was involved in international travel,"" according to the release. Investigators seemed always to just miss Manning.

""Residences, storage facilities, and vehicles tied to Manning's associate were frequently found full of personal property, and hastily abandoned,"" the release noted. Authorities believe they once almost caught up to him at a marina in Alameda, Calif.

Since his 2016 disappearance, it is unclear why or how Manning traveled to Florida, or much less his final destination, a storage trailer in Key West. After his arrest in Florida last week, he was charged locally with giving law enforcement a false name and identification.

SARASOTA, Fla. (WFLA) - SARASOTA, Fla. (WFLA) -- A massive manhunt ensued after a Sarasota, Fla. man tried to pawn his baby. Turns out, it was a prank gone wrong and the man is now speaking out. He's very sorry for what happened.

On Tuesday evening, a man entered the A&F Pawn shop in Sarasota and made a strange request to store owner Richard Jordan.

""The weirdest, strangest situation we've ever encountered,” said Jordan. ""He put it on the counter, he was pretty serious about it. He spun the baby around, and said- 'can I pawn this?'""

It lasted less than a minute, but after he left Jordan called the police. A few hours later, Brian Slocum realized he was all over the news. He called authorities to explain and soon dozens of officers were outside his home.

""They didn't find it funny or hilarious at all and there was a lot of resources and time and money that went into it,” said Slocum.

Slocum is a single dad with a seven-month-old son named Caden.

At the urging of his nephew, he started making silly videos on Snapchat. On Tuesday, Slocum recorded his latest stunt.

In the Snapchat video Slocum says: “This is what I got, I know no one under 18 in here but he's barely used, 7 ½ months old, what do you think he's worth?""

He didn't think the manager would take it seriously.

""I was thinking I'd go in there and the guy would be like, oh if it was my son, I'd give you ten grand or something,” said Slocum.

Slocum said his joke obviously fell flat.

""This is not funny! This is not funny, this is serious business,” said Jordan.

""There's nothing in the world I would trade for my son, he's my world. Nor any money is worth him,” said Slocum.

Sarasota police are not charging him, and Slocum said he has learned his lesson. He has a warning for others.

""It was a prank, it was skit and a lot of these young people don't realize that doing things like this has a consequence,” said Slocum.",http://www.wishtv.com/news/florida-man-who-tried-to-pawn-his-baby-speaks-out/1992658032,2019-05-09T20:40:44Z,WISH,"1950 N Meridian St, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA"

OS man charged with sex abuse against a girl of 12 or under,"A 55-year-old Oliver Springs man is being held in a Florida jail on $1 million bond, charged with having had sex with a child under the age of 12 by a family member or custodial authority.

A 55-year-old Oliver Springs man is being held in a Florida jail on $1 million bond, charged with having had sex with a child under the age of 12 by a family member or custodial authority.

The alleged crime is believed to have taken place while the man was visiting family in Gilchrist County, Fla., and resulted in the girl becoming pregnant, according to the Anderson County (Tenn) Sheriff’s Office.

David Andrew Cox, 984 Frost Bottom Road, was booked into the Anderson County jail in Clinton, Tenn., on April 4 on a charge of being a fugitive from justice. He was taken to the Florida law enforcement authorities on April 14, according to the news release from the Anderson County Sheriff’s Office (ACSO).

The actions against Cox began last November, when ACSO detectives were contacted by the Gilchrist County Sheriff’s Office about the possible sexual abuse of a child in that Florida county that resulted in the girl becoming pregnant. Once the girl’s baby was delivered in January, DNA from the infant was obtained by the Florida sheriff’s office. The news release stated that ACSO Detective Sgt. Josh Zisman obtained a search warrant to get DNA evidence from Cox.

“Immediately after receiving notice of the warrant, Sgt. Zisman and officers with the ACSO located Cox and placed him under arrest without incident.”

“The teamwork of both agencies resulted in removing a dangerous individual from the streets of Anderson County,” Anderson County Sheriff Russell Barker stated in the release. “I cannot express enough how proud I am of the work our detectives and officers did on this case.”

The ACSO website shows no prior arrests for Cox in Anderson County.

Pete Buttigieg Warns 'White Identity Politics' Launching Nation Into 'Crisis',"South Bend, Indiana, mayor and 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg condemned the Trump administration’s embrace of “peak white identity politics” in a speech Saturday, warning of a brewing “crisis of belonging” across the nation.

Speaking at a fundraiser in Houston for the LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, the Democrat said such politics are “designed to drive apart people with common interests.” He urged Americans instead to find unity in knowing that each of them is unique.

Buttigieg pointed to the potential for “the beginning of a new form of American solidarity” in which the country realizes “that the one thing we do have in common may be the challenge of belonging in a society that sees us for what makes us all different.”

“I’m not talking about pretending that there are equivalencies between the different patterns of exclusion in this country,” he added. “I may be a part of the LGBTQ community, but being a gay man doesn’t even tell me what it’s like to be a trans woman of color in that same community let alone an undocumented mother of four or a disabled veteran or a displaced auto worker.”

Emphasizing the differences between minorities and white populations in access to health care, employment and citizenship, Buttigieg added, “When you do not belong, it doesn’t just put you in a bad mood, it puts you in a different country.”

If elected, Buttigieg stands to become the United States’ first openly gay president, a part of his identity he has used in calls for tolerance and acceptance among a politically fractured public.

His invocation of immigrants and communities of color during his speech pushes further his efforts to overcome what critics say is his image as a white male who can only be distinguished from other white male candidates by his sexuality.

Buttigieg has also faced questions over his mayoral record, having demoted South Bend’s first black police chief, Darryl Boykins, in 2012. However, Buttigieg’s press secretary has said Boykins’ demotion was a result of his having been the subject of a federal probe.

Though President Donald Trump initially held off on bashing Buttigieg despite the mayor’s criticisms of his administration, last week, he dubbed him Alfred E. Neuman, the fictitious freckled-faced boy on the cover of Mad Magazine.

“Alfred E. Neuman cannot become president of the United States,” Trump told Politico in a phone interview on Friday.

On Wednesday, Trump questioned Buttigieg’s ability to handle international relations during a Panama City, Florida, rally, taking another jab at his potential challenger.

“He’ll be great representing us against President Xi [Jinping] of China,” Trump joked. “That’ll be great. I want to be in that room, I wanna watch that one.”

In a response mirroring the sentiment of his Saturday speech, Buttigieg cited a Chinese proverb.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pete-buttigieg-white-identity-politics-crisis-of-belonging_n_5cd86ca5e4b054da4e8b316a,2019-05-12T17:23:15Z,HuffPost,"770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, USA"

Police Identify Vehicle in Near-Fatal Hit-and-Run in Westport,"Authorities are looking for a person who hit a woman, stopped to apologize and took off.

Investigators announced Saturday that they believe a gray BMW 3 Series vehicle was involved in a near-fatal hit-and-run accident that left a woman in critical condition in Westport, Massachusetts.

The vehicle, authorities say, is likely a model from 1999 through 2005 and should have sustained minor damage to its hood, front end and/or front passenger side.

The Westport Police Department said they were alerted to the crash around 8:15 p.m. Tuesday evening.

The victim, 30-year-old Stephanie Tripp, was located by first responders on Old Bedford Road lying facedown in the breakdown lane with serious injuries. The Fall River resident was taken to Rhode Island Hospital and remains in critical condition.

No Kidding: Goat Farm Sees Spring Baby Boom

Authorities said the victim was walking on the roadside when she was hit. The driver was reportedly male. A witness told police he left the car and told the witness that he did not intend to hit the woman and was sorry.

The witness told the driver to stay and wait for police, but officials said the man drove off eastbound while the witness was helping the victim.

A different witness tried to follow the suspect, who was reportedly speeding and swerving past cars by going into the opposite lane of traffic, but eventually lost sight of the suspect's car around Faunce Corner Road in Dartmouth.

The vehicle was last seen at the corner of Old Fall River Road and Faunce Corner Road in Dartmouth around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday. It may have minor front end damage.

Tripp's aunt released a statement Friday saying the family was overwhelmed with grief but hopeful Tripp would make a full recovery.

""Anyone who knows her will tell you she is a fighter. My family is hopeful that the person responsible for this accident will come forward,"" read the statement. ""This person must have panicked and fled and must be just as scared as we are. Please come forward. Our family is looking for answers and a sincere apology.""

Man claims self-defense after allegedly stabbing man who spit on his car,"- Hillsborough County Assistant State Attorney Jay Pruner says Teddy Baltimore Smith killed a man for no reason.

""If you believe the evidence, a person who stabs another person for spitting on a car window presents a danger to the community. [The victim] lost his life over nothing,“ Pruner told a courtroom Friday.

Smith, however, says the stabbing death of Gilbert Serna was self-defense. He's using Florida's controversial 'stand your ground' law to try and win immunity from prosecution.

Smith claims the day of the incident, Serna spat through the passenger's side window of a Dodge Ram pickup onto Smiths car.

An angry Smith got out of his car to confront Serna, but Smith claims Serna was the aggressor.

Continue reading below

""He believed [Serna] was reaching for what he believed was a machete in the bed of the truck,"" explained attorney Anthony Rickman, who is not involved in the case.

During Smith's bond hearing, detective Neal Smith described what happened next.

""He reached over with his right hand and stabs the passenger in the chest area,"" said the detective.

Serna died of his injuries and Smith took off in his black BMW.

Jeffery Hunter, who was the driving the pickup, confirmed his passenger, Gilbert Serna, was aggressive.

Now the question is: Was Smith justified in using deadly force?

Rickman says prosecutors have plenty to work with, ""if the defendant was in fear for hs life if he felt it was necessary that he was defending himself then why did he flee, why did he leave the scene, why did he run?"" questioned Rickman.

Police in a small Maine community are searching for the man who they say robbed an ice cream shop Thursday night while two teenage girls were closing up shop.

The incident happened at Route 160 Ice Cream in Hiram.

""From what I understand, they had shut the windows, it was basically eight o'clock,"" said Andrew Glidden, who co-owns the shop with his wife. ""They grabbed the flags, came in the back door, put the flags up here and it was then he entered through the back door.""

No Kidding: Goat Farm Sees Spring Baby Boom

A Pennsylvania farm is experiencing an unprecedented baby boom - just in time for spring. Three goats welcomed triplets, quadruplets and a set of quintuplets at the Amish Farm & House, which is planning on a ""baby goat shower"" to celebrate. (Published Friday, May 10, 2019)

""He told the girls he had a gun, to get on the floor, told them if they moved he would kill them,"" said Glidden.

The two teens were scared but not hurt and didn't move until police arrived and were sure the thief had left.

The robber stole about $80 in cash, the girls' cell phones and a purse before fleeing on foot.

Although no one was physically hurt, Glidden says the robber stole a lot of the shop's spirit. He and his wife had just bought Route 160 Ice Cream in the fall.

The couple reopened it to give high school kids a place to work and to restore the business to the popular spot they remembered while growing up in the area.

""My father helped out a ton with all the updates,"" said Glidden. ""It's been a long early spring getting everything ready.""

Now, just days into its season, the shop was closed Friday as the staff had to regroup.

""You think a small community in Maine, it's never going happen here,"" he said. ""It does, it did.""

Glidden said there is a plan to move forward and will be installing security cameras which they had planned to do anyway.

With Mother's Day on Sunday, the staff expect a big weekend crowd and are excited to move forward.

""We're going to show we have a strong backbone,"" said Glidden.

Anyone with information about the robbery suspect is asked to contact Maine's Oxford County Sheriff's Office.

“We commend the job well done by Detective Amy Hardwick and the Horry County Police Department,” said Seth Oskin, the assistant solicitor who prosecuted the case for the 15th Circuit Solicitor’s Office. “This was a tragic situation for all parties involved, and we hope the plea helps Mr. Sprott’s family take the next step in the healing process.”",http://www.wbtw.com/crime/grand-strand-crime/longs-man-pleads-guilty-receives-18-year-sentence-in-2017-shooting-death-of-fl-man/1992624019,2019-05-09T20:23:59Z,WBTW,"101 McDonald Ct, Myrtle Beach, SC 29588, USA"

Bicyclist injured by fishing line strung across Florida bike path,"(WESH) A Sunday bike ride through an Ormond Beach, Florida park was anything but pleasant for a woman and her boyfriend.

He said he rode right into a fishing line, tied off between a dock and a tree, that was at neck height.

The man said he had to fall off his bike to avoid a possible life-threatening injury.

""I'm lucky to walk away. It's just scary to think that something like that is out here,"" the man said.

""He could have gone right through it, and it could have taken his head off in all reality,"" his girlfriend added.

""It was burning, like somebody was like, taking fishing wire or something like that trying to decapitate me the whole time,"" he said.

The man and his girlfriend asked not to be identified since they ride bikes in Central Park almost daily, and fear reprisal for sounding the alarm.

BONIFAY, Fla. - A Bonifay man was arrested and charged with possession of child pornography Thursday.

Agents with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement arrested 54-year-old Mark Turberville, 54, of 1344 Gavin Road, Bonifay on 20 counts of possession of child pornography.

FDLE agents initiated an investigation in April when child pornography activity was identified on the internet. On Thursday, the FDLE Pensacola Cyber Squad and the Holmes County Sheriff’s Office executed a search warrant at Turberville’s residence. While on scene, computer forensic examiners conducted forensic previews on a computer belonging to Tuberville and located 20 images containing child pornography, officials wrote in a news release.

These images depicted children between three and 11 years old.



Turberville was arrested yesterday and booked into the Holmes County Jail.

Report: Florida needs to bolster health preparedness,"TALLAHASSEE — As the 2019 hurricane season looms and as hepatitis A cases continue to soar in Florida, a report issued Wednesday shows that more work needs to be done to ensure the health and safety of residents against emerging infectious diseases, terrorism and extreme weather conditions.

Florida scored a 6.7 on the 2019 National Health Security Preparedness Index, putting it on par with the national average. The report, issued by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, analyzed 129 different measures for each state and the nation. The measures are spread across six broad categories and tallied for an overall score.

Glen Mays, a professor of health policy at the University of Kentucky who worked on the index, said the information is being shared to try to improve the nation’s ability to ensure the public health and safety of citizens during disasters.

“Given that as a country we are facing more of these emergency situations, natural disasters, man-made disasters and more disease outbreaks, so raising awareness about what each state can do and where the strengths are and also where the weaknesses are, we hope that can mobilize some people to take some action,” he said. “That’s the major purpose. Because when it comes to disaster preparedness, it’s largely a voluntary effort. You’re trying to get organizations willing to work together to do their part. And this provides a way of showing where we are.”

The assessment was originally developed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2013. The goal is to attain a composite score of 9, which would indicate a “strong health security level.”

Florida earned a 9 in two categories: health security surveillance and incident and information management.

Health security surveillance encompasses the ability to monitor and detect health threats and to identify where hazards start and spread so that they can be contained rapidly. Incident and information management focuses on the ability to deploy people, supplies, money and information to locations where they are most effective in protecting health.

Mays said the state’s scores in those areas are buoyed by its experiences with hurricanes. “Practice makes perfect,” he said.

Florida lags the national average in half of the six categories and outperforms the nation in the other half. For example, Mays noted Florida’s lackluster performance in community planning and engagement, which involves developing and maintaining relationships among government agencies, community organizations and households.

Florida scored a 4.8 in the category, below the national average of 5.2.

“That’s foundational to everything else you do to be prepared for disasters,” Mays said. “In that domain, we are measuring how well organizations are communicating and coordinating their activities and if they are well-positioned to kind of share information and resources to better respond when disasters strike. So it’s really critical stuff.”

The state also lagged behind in two other categories: health-care delivery and countermeasure management.

Health-care delivery focuses on the ability to ensure access to high-quality medical services across the continuum of care during and after disasters and emergencies. Mays said the state’s overall performance in the category was hindered by worse-than-average nursing home performance and mental-health access.

Mays said Florida nursing homes in 2018 had a higher-than-average number of federal citations for failing to comply with emergency preparedness plans. Moreover, he said, “a larger share of the population in the state of Florida is underserved by mental-health professionals. They are very important in helping people, particularly in the aftermath of disasters.”

Countermeasure management evaluates the ability to store and deploy health-related products and supplies that protect people from diseases and injuries. The average score nationwide was 6.5 out of 10. Florida scored 6.1.

Mays said the performance on the measurement also was due to the state’s relatively low vaccination rates for seniors and young children. Though there is growing controversy about vaccines, they are one of the best countermeasures to keep people protected from disease.

“It’s a problem nationally, but it looks like Florida may have a little more of a problem in that area,” Mays told The News Service of Florida.

The score regarding vaccinations came amid an outbreak of hepatitis A. Florida has had a reported 1,037 cases of the liver disease this year, nearly double the amount reported for all of 2018, according to numbers posted on the state Department of Health website.

Hepatitis A can be spread through such things as food or drinks that have been contaminated with fecal matter from people with the disease. Health officials have urged people to get vaccinated against the disease.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190510/report-florida-needs-to-bolster-health-preparedness?rssfeed=true,2019-05-10T17:50:00Z,Daily Commercial,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA"

Deputies: Man accused of torturing little girl kills himself,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man accused of torturing his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter by burning her, shooting her with a BB gun and wearing a werewolf mask to scare her has killed himself.

An Escambia County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman says 37-year-old Andrew Bennett Ross Celauis died at a hospital Tuesday.



Celauis was arrested April 9. He tried to kill himself May 1 in his jail cell and was hospitalized. He died six days later.



Investigators say Celauis filmed himself torturing the child. They say he placed a dog collar on the girl and shocked her awake at night. Then he stood over her wearing a werewolf mask.



Investigators say the mother didn't know about the abuse. It was discovered when she brought the girl to the hospital for treatment of ringworm, which turned out to be burns.

"Cape Coral mom celebrates miracle daughter this Mother's Day, 9 months after dad's death","CLOSE Cape Coral mom welcomes girl after dad's death Ricardo Rolon, Fort Myers News-Press

Tiffany Bannworth looks into the faces of her seven children and sees her husband.

They are all she has left of the man who'd been her life partner for nearly 20 years. Stephen Bannworth died in August in a Fort Myers motorcycle crash.

This Mother's Day, the Cape Coral mother will celebrate each of the boys they created and the miracle daughter born nine months after his death with a nice dinner and family outing.

""We're replacing a bad memory with remembrance of happiness and celebration,"" she said of the holidays and anniversaries since their lives upended.

Tiffany Bannworth sits with her children Dante Alexander, 16; Cairo Hawthorne, 12; Jasper Constantine, 10; Roman Zhivago, 8; Quinton Phineas,7; Kipling Cicero, 5; and Amunet Corencia Pearl, 2.5 weeks. Bannworth's husband Steven died in a motorcycle crash last year. Calling him the ""perfect husband"" he left her a lingering gift: A baby girl, born on Good Friday.

The six boys look like their dad Stephen Bannworth at different stages of his life, she said, as she cradles his final gift in her arms.

Amunet Corencia Pearl Bannworth arrived on Good Friday. The 35-year-old mother gave her the moniker they'd decided upon if it was girl during a 2007 pregnancy, their third.

""He would recognize it anywhere,"" she said of their daughter's name. Amunet is the Egyptian goddess of mystery. She joins siblings Dante, Cairo, Jasper, Roman, Quinton and Kipling Bannworth. A seventh son, Gatsby Bannworth, died six years ago at 3 months old.

Oldest son Dante, 16, said last year started out ""great at first,"" the six boys and their parents taking weekend outings and enjoying their time with one another.

Then, his father's death abruptly changed their trajectory.

""Now it sucks because my dad wanted a girl,"" Dante Bannworth said, his father's prayers answered in death, only never to see her.

Stephen Bannworth was a stay-at-home dad. He and Tiffany met and courted, having Dante when Tiffany was 19. Stephen supported her dreams, saw her through college and her doctorate.

She is now executive director at Nicaea Academy of Southwest Florida, a birth through college education facility in Cape Coral. Amunet sleeps in her mother's office, all six boys always nearby, attending classes.

The family's closeness is no surprise. It's what Stephen Bannworth cultivated, Tiffany Bannworth said.

Tiffany and Stephen Bannworth were with each other every day — a streak of 3,992 of them — since Sept. 1, 2007, she said. If she went on a quick archaeology trip — one of her many interests and qualifications — she left Saturday morning and returned Sunday night, making sure they kissed good-bye and hello.

Tiffany, an only child, had always known Stephen wanted a big family.

The Bannworth family is nearly three times the size of the average family. The U.S. Census Bureau counted about 83.09 million families with an average of 3.14 persons in 2018, down from 3.7 in the 1960s.

Dante was the first baby Tiffany Bannworth ever held. Within weeks, she told Stephen she wanted more. Lots more.

Four years after Dante, the Bannworths had five more sons within six years.

Their sixth, Gatsby, died in his sleep three months after his birth.

""We thought that was the unthinkable,"" she said. But Stephen held the family together.

""He was so strong and cultivated a tight-knit family,"" she said. ""A part of our hearts were missing. He carried us through the grief.""

Within the year, son Kipling was born, and Stephen understood Tiffany's fears of losing another child.

""I was scared it could happen again,"" Tiffany Bannworth said. ""He said he would quit his job and watch Kipling until he went to school.""

He kept that promise: Kipling started kindergarten days after Stephen's death.

In the years between, Stephen Bannworth washed their clothes, cooked and cleaned and did all the home repairs himself.

""Some people thought he was just some schlub,"" she said. ""He was so incredible. He was more of a man than I could ever imagine meeting.""

Their passion lasted their entire marriage.

Over the summer, the family car needed replacing.

While waiting on a new vehicle to arrive last August, Stephen Bannworth would take Tiffany to work on the back of his motorcycle. He did so the Saturday before his death.

He would park across from the main building on campus and rev the engine as she walked across the lot.

""He'd blow kisses and wink,"" she said. ""I still got flustered. We were really love struck.""

She drove the new vehicle to school for the first time the morning he died. He had fixed the locks on the vehicle to prepare it for use the day before. He'd also repaired the curio cabinet glass, cleaned the house and washed every bit of laundry, not knowing he wouldn't return from his motorcycle ride.

She remembers the acute feeling of loss in the days after his death — she didn't have a single stitch of clothing remaining that carried his scent.

""The glaring absence of him was noticed by me,"" she said, adding she was in her bed, crying to God: ""Let me be pregnant with his last child.'""

Then, when her pregnancy was confirmed six weeks later, ""How blessed I felt. What a miracle it was.""

Friends, family and even strangers stepped up to help fill the void. A GoFundMe campaign raised more than $12,000; a woman linked to the Nicaea school paid for the entire funeral. Christmas came and people showered the family with gift cards.

People told her stories about how Stephen had helped them, without her ever knowing.

On the weekend that would have been their wedding anniversary, friends gathered to celebrate the couple. The next day, Tiffany Bannworth said, 50 people came to her baby shower.

On her birthday Tuesday, the school's students gathered around a store-bought birthday cake with the bright yellow icing, macaroons and doughnuts. Her sons surrounded her, Amunet on her lap, as everyone sang 'Happy Birthday.""

It's a new memory, to complement the other birthdays where Stephen would make any kind of cake she asked.

""It's difficult to be away from him,"" she said. ""There's never going to be another man like Steve.""

As Mother's Day loomed, she reflected on what she learned from the man she knew she could spend several lifetimes with and follow the example he set.

""He was very loving and doting and protective and very pure,"" she said. "" ... Co-parenting with him was a piece of cake.""

That they are a strong family and going through life together shows in how the brothers have welcomed Amunet.

""They are very protective of her,"" Tiffany Bannworth said, ""especially (Kipling). They don't want anybody to touch her.""

She will spend her Mother's Day, the first having a daughter, thinking about the man who helped her become a mom and making memories with the six versions of himself he left behind.

""This was a day that Stevie lavished me with gifts and attention,"" she said. He'd take the boys to a thrift store to look for antique glass.

""I have a big collection, but I refuse to spend a lot of money on it,"" she said. ""That used to bug Steve. He liked to buy me expensive things, but I liked the novelty of finding it for next to nothing.

""This year there will be none of that.""

She planned to cook a nice dinner on Saturday, inviting her mother to join them.

She cherishes the memories Stephen left her with, their last morning together and their final embrace.

""Boy, would I kill for another kiss from my husband,"" she said.

‘They didn’t find it funny’: Florida man regrets trying to pawn his baby for laughs on Snapchat,"

Brian Slocum, 43, became the subject of a Sarasota Police Department investigation after he wandered into a local pawn shop and asked how much money he could get for his seven-month-old baby. (Sarasota Police Department/Sarasota Police Department)

Brian Slocum thought he had a pretty good idea for a joke.

The 43-year-old was driving down the main commercial thoroughfare in Sarasota, Fla., on Tuesday evening when he spotted A&F Pawn Jewelry and Loan, nestled in between a vape shop and a beauty salon in a shell-colored strip mall. Nabbing a prime parking spot in front of the store, he breezed past a sign warning that no one under the age of 18 would be allowed inside, and plopped his infant son, Caden, on the counter.

“This is what I got,” he announced to the pawnshop’s owner. “I know, no one under 18 in here, but he’s barely used, 7-and-a-half months old. What do you think he’s worth?”

The single father figured the stunt would be prime material for the comedic Snapchat account that his nephew had recently encouraged him to start. But his attempt at dad humor went over like a ton of bricks.

Before long, Slocum learned that his face was splashed all over the local TV news and the Sarasota Police Department had asked anyone who recognized him or spotted his dark blue Nissan to call 911. As it turned out, the pawnshop had taken his questions about whether it was possible to pawn a baby completely seriously, and handed authorities surveillance footage that showed Slocum, clad in cargo shorts and a blue baseball cap advertising Corona beer, offering up a wide-eyed infant to a complete stranger.

“This is not funny!” Richard Jordan, the store’s owner, told WFLA after he learned the truth, his eyes flaring with disgust. “This is not funny, this is serious business.""

The new father was hardly the first to underestimate the stakes of what was supposed to be a harmless joke. Other pranksters have wound up injured or in jail as a result of poorly-conceived stunts that they cooked up in hopes of going viral, from the man who had to be rescued by firefighters after he cemented his head in a microwave to the YouTuber who was escorted out of his home in handcuffs after he decided it would be funny to film himself taking down stop signs.

Slocum, who got off relatively easy by comparison, had similarly thought of his stunt as lighthearted fodder for social media. Unbeknownst to the store clerk, he had surreptitiously been recording their exchange with his cellphone, and had anticipated that the man would get the joke and run with it.

""I was thinking I’d go in there and the guy would be like, ‘Oh, if it was my son, I’d give you ten grand,’ or something,” Slocum later explained to WFLA. In the Snapchat videos that he provided to the station, he can be heard telling the clerk that he only wanted the boy to be held as collateral: “Just pawn, I don’t want to get rid of him.”

Instead, his cavalier attitude toward the small boy in striped footie pajamas, who stamped his feet with obvious relish as he waited to learn his fate, set off alarm bells.

""It was the weirdest, strangest situation we’ve ever encountered,” Jordan told WFLA. “He put it on the counter, he was pretty serious about it. He spun the baby around, and said, ‘Can I pawn this?’”

Stunned to the point of speechlessness, Jordan didn’t respond. With a nod of resignation, Slocum hoisted the baby’s car seat back up off the counter.

“I just need a babysitter for like two weeks,” he reportedly complained as he left the store with his son in tow.

After the door slammed shut, the clerk picked up the phone to notify authorities that he was worried about the child’s safety. Equally alarmed, officers began using “vast resources” to track down the identity of the strange man who had asked about the retail value of a baby, a Wednesday statement from the Sarasota Police Department said. In an alert that was shared with the public on Tuesday night, police noted that they had no idea if he was even related to the infant that he had apparently been willing to treat like a flat-screen television or used guitar.

""They didn’t find it funny or hilarious at all and there was a lot of resources and time and money that went into it,” Slocum shamefacedly acknowledged in a Wednesday interview with WFLA.

['Did you get your hair cut?' Readers share their favorite, ridiculously awful dad jokes]

Just hours after he pulled out of the pawnshop’s parking lot, the lanky, lightly-bearded father was shocked to discover that law enforcement was searching for him, and it was all over the evening news. He called police to explain that the “suspicious incident” had actually been a prank intended for social media clout. Before long, he told WFLA, dozens of officers had surrounded his home.

Eventually, the officers confirmed that little Caden was safe, and not in any danger of being sold to a pawnbroker. Police announced Wednesday that they had contacted the Florida Department of Children and Families as a standard part of their investigation, but found no reason to press charges against the boy’s father. Making terrible dad jokes, it turns out, isn’t considered a crime.

Sitting on his porch later that day, Slocum told WFLA that he was very sorry for all the trouble that he had caused, and had learned his lesson. He warned other aspiring comedians not to make the same mistake.

""A lot of these young people don’t realize that doing things like this has a consequence,” he told the station, dressed in a T-shirt that proudly spelled out the letters “D-A-D” in bold capital letters across his chest.

“There’s nothing in the world I would trade for my son,” he added. “He’s my world.""

The boy bounced in his rocker and emitted delighted screams. “How could you want to get rid of that?” Slocum asked.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/05/10/they-didnt-find-it-funny-florida-man-regrets-trying-pawn-his-baby-laughs-snapchat/,2019-05-10T05:28:59Z,Washington Post,"1301 K St NW, Washington, DC 20071"

Clearwater man has warning for pet owners after Yorkie killed by coyotes,"CLEARWATER, Fla. (WFLA) - A Clearwater man is warning neighbors to keep their pets protected and yards secure after he says coyotes snatched and killed his small dog.

James Devito has lived on Sharkey Road for four years and says he's never seen as many coyotes running around as he has in the last six months. When he can, he tries to grab photos or videos of coyotes in his yard on his cell phone.

It's been a week and a half since Devito says coyotes carried off his tiny Yorkie named “Gucci.”

Devito said he let Gucci out to go to the bathroom in his screen-in pool area like he did every night. But suddenly, he heard a loud yelp.

He went outside and the dog was nowhere to be found.

“I mean, they're huge. One is like 40-50 lbs,” Devito said.

By law, Devito can hire a trapper to take care of the coyotes.

But he said he hates the idea of paying hundreds of dollars to have them killed.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission doesn’t offer a relocation program.

“What they should do is they should trap them and maybe neuter them. People say, ‘oh we're taking over their land.’ That's not true there’s been no new building here, they're just reproducing,” Devito said.

The day after Gucci disappeared, Devito installed motion sensor lights all around his property.

He’s also vowed to watch his other dogs like a hawk, never letting them out without having something to keep the coyotes at bay.

“If you've got a little dog 10 pounds and under, even if you have them on a leash, I'd be very hesitant about walking without having some type of a pole or bat or something. To just beat them off because they're hungry,” he said.

FWC said you’re allowed to hunt or trap coyotes year around if you are on your own property.

On Thursday, an official with Morgan's team confirmed to Fox 35 that the attorney would be holding a fundraiser for Biden.

HOLIDAY, Fla. (WFLA) - Authorities in Pasco County are searching for a man who approached two young girls before school Thursday and asked them for sex acts.

The sheriff's office says it happened just before 8 a.m. while the two girls were waiting for their bus. The girls were at the intersection of Ironware Drive and Pleasure Drive when they say the man approached them.

According to deputies, the man asked both girls if they would perform sexual acts on him. When the girls' bus started to approach the intersection, the man drove off.

""The brazenness of someone to pull up to juvenile females just waiting to go to school - it's getting toward the end of the school year - and just ask them outright for sexual things, that's absolutely disgusting,"" said Amanda Hunter, the public information officer for the sheriff's office.

Florida man faces foreclosure over fines for uncut grass,"What a pain in the grass!

A Florida man is facing possible foreclosure on his home due to fines over the height of the grass in his yard.

The city of Dunedin moved to foreclose on resident Jim Ficken’s home after Ficken racked up more than $29,000 in fines because his grass exceeded the 10 inches the city allows.

COUPLE MUST PAY NEARLY $600G FOR REMOVING OAK TREE FROM THEIR PROPERTY, JUDGE RULES

Ficken, 69, is fighting back, suing the city over what he and his attorneys with the Institute for Justice call abusive and excessive fines.

Ficken and his attorneys told FOX13 he amassed the fines during a 57-day period last summer while he was out of town settling his late mother’s estate. They said Ficken hired a friend to cut the grass during that time, but the friend passed away unexpectedly. The yard is now up to city code, they said.

”The grass did what grass does, and a code inspector saw it was more than the 10 inches the city allowed, and Jim was officially on the hook,” said Andrew Ward, one of Ficken’s attorneys.

Ficken, who is retired and lives on a fixed income, was fined $500 per day, totaling nearly $30,000. He claims he wasn’t aware of the fines until they were already out of control.

STATE'S POLICE CHIEF SAYS PROPOSED LAW WILL FURTHER PUT OFFICERS IN DANGER

The city on Tuesday began moving to foreclose on Ficken’s house.

”We're arguing in our lawsuit that limitless fines are, in fact, unconstitutional,” said Ari Bargil, another of Ficken’s attorneys.

“In February, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled the 8th Amendment prohibits cities from imposing excessive fines,” Ward said.

Ficken and his legal team said they will take the case all the way to the Supreme Court if that’s what it takes.

“It is outrageous…being fined this amount for being tardy cutting your grass,” Ficken said.

""Mr. Ficken was cited for repeat violations on his rental property,"" the city said in a statement to FOX13 News. ""On Tuesday, May 7, 2019 the City of Dunedin Code Enforcement Board authorized the City Attorney’s office to file foreclosure actions after resolution of the case could not be agreed upon with Mr. Ficken. The City Attorney’s office has not had an opportunity to review litigation filed by Mr. Ficken and as such has no comment at this juncture.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-man-faces-home-foreclosure-over-fines-for-uncut-grass-yard,2019-05-09T17:07:44Z,Fox News,"1211 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10036"

He was sentenced as a habitual felony offender on both counts which led to increased prison time, the release indicated.

The theft happened on Dec. 4 when the defendant entered the victim’s open garage at a Cape Coral home and removed a Nintendo Switch game system.

The theft was captured on home surveillance and Sullivan was identified based on a work shirt he had been wearing. The defendant’s employer confirmed his identity on the video.

After being arrested Sullivan showed where he had put the stolen item.

Here Is Trump Loving a Florida Man's 'Joke' About Murdering Immigrants,"Screenshot: The Guardian

President Donald Trump appeared before a raucous crowd of supporters for another one of his MAGA rallies in Panama City Beach, FL, on Wednesday. There, he joined the audience in laughing at an impromptu suggestion from the crowd: what if the U.S. just murdered undocumented immigrants?



“When you have 15,000 people marching up, and you have hundreds and hundreds of people, and you have two or three border security people that are brave and great,” Trump said. “And don’t forget, we don’t let them and we can’t let them use weapons. We can’t. Other countries do. We can’t. I would never do that. But how do you stop these people?”

At that point an as-of-yet unidentified member of the audience shouted “Shoot them!” Trump simply chuckled along with the crowd, noting, “That’s only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement.” Good lord.",https://splinternews.com/here-is-trump-loving-a-florida-mans-joke-about-murderin-1834635814,2019-05-09T12:28:00Z,Splinter,"8551 NW 30th Terrace, Doral, FL 33122"
Florida man gets life for slaying he blamed on sleepwalking,"A man who claimed he was sleepwalking when he stabbed his roommate to death has been sentenced to life in prison.

The Palm Beach Post reports 26-year-old Randy Herman Jr. was convicted Wednesday of first-degree murder and sentenced. Herman argued that he was sleepwalking when he stabbed 21-year-old Brooke Preston more than 20 times at an area home in March 2017.

He testified he had no memory of the attack, just being covered in blood with a knife in his hand.

A forensic psychologist testified that Herman's history of sleepwalking could explain the attack. Herman's defense argued there was no motive or history of violence between the two. Investigators said Preston was preparing to move to New York.

Prosecutors rejected the sleepwalking claim, saying the attack was deliberate.

“He literally could have been decapitated.

"Florida man fined $30,000 for tall grass. Now the city is foreclosing on his home.","Letting your grass grow too high might cost you — or at least it did for one Florida man.

The city of Dunedin’s Code Enforcement Board moved to foreclose the home of Jim Ficken, 69, Tuesday after he failed to pay nearly $30,000 in code violation fines he accrued in 2018, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

The city fined him $500 per day over the summer because his grass grew higher than 10 inches.

Ficken filed a lawsuit against Dunedin on the same day the city moved to foreclose his home.

The suit also hopes to end the city’s alleged practice of fining people “without considering a homeowner’s ability to pay.”

Ficken held a news conference in front of his home Wednesday to announce the filing of the lawsuit. His lawn was trimmed.

“It’s an excessive fine, and everyone I’ve spoken to says it’s outrageous,” Ficken, a retiree on a fixed income, said.

Dunedin mayor Julie Ward Bujalski defended the Code Enforcement Board by saying it’s a “citizen-driven body that reacts to complaints from other Dunedin residents.”

Ficken’s attorneys said they haven’t seen any evidence that neighbors complained.

'Florida Man' TV series in development at true-crime channel Oxygen,"CLOSE Florida is home to castles made of coral and aluminum printing plates. Visitors also can hunt a skunk ape and take photos of a headless dinosaur. Here is a list of unique places and attractions worth checking out in Florida. MAUREEN KENYON/TCPALM Wochit

The wacky, weird and wild world of Florida Man is getting its own show.

Oxygen Media, which announced in 2017 a full-time shift to true crime-related television, revealed Tuesday that a series based on ""America's most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State,"" has been added to the channel's projects.

There is no start date for the show, however, the series will be developed by Blumhouse Productions and Man vs. Robot. Blumhouse, founded by Jason Blum, an Academy Award nominee and Emmy Award winner, is known for producing low-budget horror films ""Get Out,"" ""The Purge"" and ""Insidious.""

Oxygen Media announced Tuesday a series called ""Florida Man,"" based on ""America's most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State,"" will be developed for the true-crime channel. (Photo: Vladone, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Officials at Oxygen say the series, with the working title of ""Florida Man,"" will focus on ""America’s most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State and will unravel the strange twists and turns and try in vain to reason how and why this breed of killers took their crimes to levels beyond comprehension.""

A description of the show reads: ""When the murder is so bizarre, the motive so far-fetched and the crime so outlandish that it sounds like something from a Hollywood screenplay, there’s a good chance it was actually committed by a ‘Florida Man.’ ""

Yep. Sounds about right.

For example, Googling ""Florida Man September 14,"" which is Gov. Ron DeSantis' birthday — by default he's Florida Man because he leads the Sunshine State — this wacky story is generated: ""Shirtless Florida man is back to take on Hurricane Florence because the internet made it so.""

New pastor fires up Stewart Road Church of God,"With his self-described “fiery” preaching style, Pastor Keith Hawes is growing Stewart Road Church of God.

“My delivery is more expressive and a little more passionate. I get excited, fiery,” said Pastor Hawes, who became lead pastor Feb. 3. “(We) are younger pastors. We are able to bring some fresh energy and passion. I’m thankful for the opportunity.”

His multi-generational congregation is responding.

Adults, seniors and teens alike are clapping, standing, crying and choosing to follow Jesus.

Each Sunday, about 500 people turn out for worship. About 900 came for Easter. The church seats 1,200.

“The Lord has sent a young man. The Lord has given him a special gift to preach and spread the good news,” said Joan Goble, a nurse and chaplain at the church. “Every Sunday since his arrival, the sanctuary is full and the Holy Spirit is alive. It is obvious that he loves the Lord and has dedicated his life to the Lord. His message is powerful.”

“I feel Monroe was sleeping until Keith Hawes showed up and woke up Monroe,” said Nathan Hanmore.

But Pastor Hawes isn’t taking the credit alone.

“It’s really the church. They are excited about what God is doing. It’s the visions of being a church that is reaching our city,” he said. “(The church) is in revival. We have a new youth pastor; a lot of teens are coming. We have a strong senior adult ministry. Even the seniors are so super excited,” he said.

A native of Louisiana, Pastor Hawes most recently served a church in Mount Pleasant. He came to Monroe to succeed Dr. Joseph Byrd, the longtime Stewart Road Church of God pastor who took a new assignment in Florida.

The two pastors served together on the board of God’s Pit Crew, a disaster relief effort.

“Pastor Byrd is a tremendous leader, a great pastor. He did a great job,” said Pastor Hawes.

Stewart Road Church is the fourth church Pastor Hawes has served. He also speaks across the country.

Raised non-denominational, Pastor Hawes entered the ministry at 15, he said, when he had “a significant experience with God. I knew I was called into ministry.”

He preached his first sermon as a teen, became a local evangelist and graduated from Oral Roberts University, Tulsa, Okla.

At 22, he had his first church.

Despite a brief stint as a middle school English and math teacher, he’s been a preacher most of his life.

Ten years ago he found the Church of God.

When he learned about the pastoral opening at Stewart Road, he began to pray.

“From the minute I was made aware of it, I committed to pray and discern the will of God. God moved in just several miraculous and powerful ways. I felt like this was God’s will for our life,” said Pastor Hawes.

So, he came to Monroe with his wife, Melissa, and 8-year-old daughter, Olivia.

“Monroe seems to be a family-oriented community. We’ve fallen in love with the church and the community. Monroe’s a great town,” he said.

He plans to make it even better.

“A lot of what I hear is that drugs are a problem. We would love to do anything that we can to help strengthen and help families and let them know Stewart Road is a church welcome to all,” he said.

To that end, the week before Easter, the church held Love Week. Gifts were given to mail carriers, teachers and others in the community.

The church also sponsors medical missions.

But, there are plans for much more.

“Our heart is to be a church that brings transformation to our church and our city,” said Pastor Hawes. “We’d like to partner with schools and other organizations to help provide for people in need. We will have a disaster relief team — God’s Pit Crew — in the church that would help with disasters. We’d love to build a community center with 24/7 outreach center. I think it’s an amazing church, and we’re excited to see what God is going to do here.”",https://www.monroenews.com/news/20190512/new-pastor-fires-up-stewart-road-church-of-god?rssfeed=true,2019-05-12T22:21:00Z,Monroe News,"20 W 1st St, Monroe, MI 48161, USA"
Arizona man pleads guilty to taking money from Gadsden City High,"There’s probably a coaching lesson in the almost-four-year journey Gadsden City Schools traveled to recoup money stolen from it in connection with an out-of-state football game in 2015.

The booking agent who contracted to arrange plane tickets and hotel rooms for players and coaches of the 2015 team for its game against Goose Creek High School in South Carolina failed to do so, leaving the team to make bus travel arrangements and get lodgings near time for the September game.

When Director of School Operations Keith Blackwell and then-Gadsden City High School Principal Jeff Colegrove started checking into it, they learned the same agent had done the same thing to nine other schools, from Daytona Beach, Florida, to Los Angeles.

“What he did was flat-out wrong,” Blackwell said. “We couldn’t let him get away with it.”

With the help of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Etowah County District Attorney Jody Willoughby and Deputy District Attorney Brynn Crain, who handled the prosecution, Brian Hercules of Scottsdale, Arizona, won’t get away with it.

Hercules entered a plea agreement Tuesday in Etowah County Circuit Court, pleading guilty to three counts of theft by deception for three payments made to him by the school.

The prosecution recommended a 40-month suspended sentences, with Hercules to serve three years of supervised probation.

He was ordered to pay Gadsden City High School restitution of $44,700 — $9,655 of it to be paid immediately.

Sentencing was continued for six months, and if Hercules pays the remaining balance of the restitution, he will be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea and the case will be dismissed.

Coaches and schools officials worked well in advance to set up the game in South Carolina — a first-ever out-of-state game for the Titans — and did what several other state teams did: turned to Hercules to handle travel and lodging.

“He came highly recommended,” Blackwell said, having handled such trips for Hoover High School before.

Planning for the trip started while Blackwell was principal at Gadsden City High, and continued after Colegrove took over the job. Colegrove now is principal at Etowah High School.

As it got closer to game time, Hercules stopped returning calls from Gadsden City.

After some investigation, Colegrove said, they learned he hadn’t made hotel arrangements. He had purchased maybe 15 plane tickets, Blackwell said.

Colegrove said some of the money that went toward the trip came from regular fundraising activities for the football team, and the rest from the school — and it was gone.

“We had to fund the trip,” Colegrove said.

Arrangements had to be made to take students to South Carolina by bus, and hotel rooms had to be found.

There were a few students whose tickets had been purchased, and that led to some hard feelings at home, from parents and supporters who didn’t understand why some had tickets and some didn’t.

And it was not the school system’s fault — it was all owing to Hercules’ failings, Blackwell said.

It took a long time to get the issue settled, he said, but they didn’t feel they could drop it.

“He ripped off all our kids,” Blackwell said, by not giving them the experience — the flight included — that he was paid for.

Blackwell said he learned nine other schools had similar experiences with Hercules.

“I called all nine,” he said. To his understanding, schools paid a total of about a quarter-million dollars to the agent for trips that were mishandled.

“I don’t know if any of the other schools are going after him,” Blackwell said.

“We had to,” he said, to do what was right for the school system.",https://www.gadsdentimes.com/news/20190511/arizona-man-pleads-guilty-to-taking-money-from-gadsden-city-high?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T19:56:41Z,Gadsden Times,"401 Locust St, Gadsden, AL 35901, USA"
"North Fort Myers, Dunbar and Riverdale knock the rust off in spring football scrimmage","CLOSE North Fort Myers hosted Dunbar, Riverdale and perennial power Venice as part of a controlled scrimmage in spring football workouts leading up to spring games the next 2 weeks. Bryan Cooney, bcooney@news-press.com

After a play that resulted in a North Fort Myers defensive lineman jumping offside and a Red Knights assistant coach throwing his hands up in disbelief, Red Knights head coach Dwayne Mack flashed a big smile.

""It's just the spring man!"", Mack bellowed out. ""We're going to be fine!""

Saturday morning was not your ordinary spring practice session for three of Lee County's top programs as North Fort Myers hosted Dunbar, Riverdale and perennial power Venice in a structured scrimmage setting. With teams getting a total of 20 practice days including their official spring game to work with before the summer, Mack touted the session as a success for all.

""I think today was a huge success for everybody because you're getting reps on a Saturday and usually you are at home,"" Mack said. ""You only get 20 days and your 20th day is your spring game so we wanted to get a competitive edge going inviting these teams. We tried to bring some of the best teams from the area from last year together.""

In 2018, the four programs went a combined 37-12 and all made state playoff appearances. While the scrimmage was just an opportunity for the teams to get to practice against a different colored jersey, the three Lee County programs will see each other in the regular season.

Dunbar head coach Sammy Brown and his Tigers will meet the Riverdale in their season opener at home on Aug. 23 and will travel to play Mack's Red Knights on Oct. 11. Entering his fourth year at the helm for Dunbar, Brown has been very pleased with the work his team has put in throughout the spring.

""So far, we've been doing pretty well as the spring is a good evaluation period of where your team is at,"" Brown said. ""Today, everyone got a lot of reps and the kids got to knock some of the rust off. It was a big deal to have four very good programs together, see everybody. We've been practicing well, we've been pretty fortunate with the weather.""

The Tigers will have to replace a number of key seniors from a season ago as Derick Hunter Jr., Seneca Milledge and Major Williams all will be college freshmen. Brown pointed to a few standouts in the spring that fans will need to pay attention to as the next wave of Dunbar standouts.

""Jarques Riggins at quarterback, Greg Thomas at receiver and Bobby Dennis also at receiver has been a bright spot for us,"" Brown said. ""We're happy with what we've got. We'll finish up spring with our game at Port Charlotte next Friday, get into our summer lifting and then head into 7-on-7's. We'll be at UCF (June) the first, Miami on the eighth and Florida State on the 15th.""

Riverdale will also need to rely on newcomers to step into the place of multiple contributors that graduated including running back Quantavious Brown. Raiders defensive coordinator Steve Howard said that Saturday was an important day to get a gauge of where the team is at.

""To see our guys going up against quality opponents like North, Dunbar and having Venice come down here was really good,"" Howard said. ""It was a really good atmosphere and a good way to test the mettle of our kids.""

Riverdale's spring will conclude with their game next Friday against Hardee, another team that had an undefeated regular season in 2018 but fell in their opening round game in the state playoffs. The challenge of replacing not only playmakers such as Brown but having depth in key areas in the trenches and in the secondary will be a challenge for Raiders head coach James Delgado and company.

""We don't have a big group of seniors, but they are taking the younger guys under their wing,"" Howard said. ""I think overall we're moving in the right direction, we lost a lot to graduation and we've got a lot of young kids year-wise but also experience-wise. Today was a live test to not say that you're a young pup anymore and Hardee will be another test for them moving forward as a team.""

North Fort Myers will be another program needing to fill in holes left behind by a talented senior class that included Shomari Mason, Jesse Charles, Clayton Savinsky, Hunter Kobylanski and James Buchanan. Experience at the quarterback position will be there in 2019 as Parker O'Dell transferred in from Cape Coral, and he will have a veteran offensive line headlined by Blaise Sparks to protect him.

For Mack, building off a strong first year at North Fort Myers will be a challenge that he looks for the Red Knights to meet as they will finish their spring with their game against Cypress Lake May 23.

""It's been a positive spring, but there's a lot for us to work on,"" Mack said. ""Today I saw some good things that were exciting, the kids were physical, getting to the ball. I hope we can carry this energy with us to Cypress Lake on the 23rd.""

Man claims Deltona wastewater plant noise keeps him from sleeping,"DELTONA —Keith Lawhun envisioned a quiet, semi-rural lifestyle when he purchased several acres of property near the city's border with unincorporated Osteen in 2007.

He had dreams of developing a residential community for people with physical disabilities. Lawhun hasn't had use of his arms since he was in his early 20s. He had Hodgkin's disease at 13, and the amount of radiation he received caused significant damage. While he didn't let it slow him down, he's seen how disabilities can make the people who have them feel out of place.

But Lawhun's idyllic plans have not developed. Shortly after he moved onto his property on Keelhaul Road, the city of Deltona purchased 52 acres of land next door, the future site of a wastewater treatment plant.

The wastewater plant went into operation in the spring of 2016. Lawhun claims it's so noisy it interferes with his sleep. And when the wind blows the wrong way, the stench is unavoidable.

""I'm supposed to be able to enjoy the outdoors and indoors of life here after they built the plant as I did before,"" Lawhun said while standing in his yard on a recent night, the wastewater plant humming loudly in the background. ""The crickets that you hear? That's what I should be hearing.""

The 60-year-old unsuccessfully sued the city in 2017 — the third legal action he's taken against Deltona related to the property. Lawhun's attorneys, George Trovato and Tanner Andrews, are working on an appeal, which they expect to file this month, court records show. Lawhun and his lawyers assert the city is violating its own noise ordinance with the plant, as well as the Florida Administrative Code's chapter on domestic wastewater facilities.

But Lawhun has nearly given up on finding the peace and quiet that once existed when he traveled down Keelhaul Road — a pine tree- and palmetto-lined dirt road where lightning bugs make appearances. He his wife, Emma, hope to find eventual solitude on a rural property they purchased in Kentucky.

With years gone by and about $30,000 he estimates he's spent fighting the city, Lawhun hopes to win his appeal, sell his property, write a book, and move to a place where development is harder to find.

Sound expectations

Lawhun's property is zoned agricultural, but it's also where he and his wife live. According to Deltona's city code, ""all premises containing habitually occupied sleeping quarters shall be considered residential use.""

The couple's bedroom is on the end of the house closest to the wastewater plant. Before going to bed, they turn on the exhaust fan in their nearby bathroom in an effort to drown out the plant's sharp humming.

Deltona spokesman Lee Lopez said city officials wouldn't comment for this story, citing the ongoing litigation.

But according to Deltona ordinances, sound level limits for residential property are set at 60 decibels from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. and 55 decibels from 10:01 p.m. to 6:59 a.m. That's about the sound level of a normal conversation from 3 feet away, according to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Agency.

In contrast, the wastewater plant resides on a parcel that also is zoned agricultural. There, the city sound limit can be 75 decibels at all times. That's somewhere between classroom chatter and a freight train at 100 feet, according to OSHA.

Lawhun hired sound expert Dave Parzych as part of his most recent legal effort. According to Parzych, noise from the plant often exceeds 55 decibels on Lawhun's property, and levels inside of the couple's bedroom are typically 40-plus decibels. That's about the sound of a soft whisper from 5 feet away, according to OSHA.

Parzych, founder, president and principal acoustic consultant of Power Acoustics, Inc., monitored Lawhun's property for 24 hours on June 5, 2018. Lawhun left the property for that period so as to not contribute to any sound readings.

""What we found was the sound exceeded the city of Deltona noise ordinance for residential properties relatively frequently, and inside his home the sound was well exceeding what would typically be thought of as an annoying sound by the World Health Organization,"" said Parzych, who has testified in several dozen cases related to sound.

Levels in a bedroom should be less than 30 decibels for a person to get good quality sleep, according to the World Health Organization.

During one of a reporter's visits, noise on Lawhun's property standing outside at 9 p.m. from the wastewater plant ranged from 56 to 62 decibels, according to Lawhun's digital sound meter.

Human perception of sound is such that every time there's an increase of 10 decibels, the noise seems twice as loud, Parzych said.

In Lawhun's lawsuit, he requested the city operate the wastewater plant in a manner that would not produce noise greater than 55 decibels at any time; that it not emit sounds from motors, generators and alarms between the hours of 7 p.m. and 7 a.m.; that it not make noise louder than the average volume of conversation at the property boundary; and that it not emit sound that violates the Florida Administrative Code.

The Florida Administrative Code's chapter on domestic wastewater facilities was included in the permit the city received from the state Department of Environmental Protection. In part, it states, ""new treatment plants and modifications to existing plants shall be designed and located on the site so as to minimize adverse effects resulting from odors, noise, aerosol drift and lighting."" Also, treatment plants ""shall not cause odor, noise, aerosol drift or lighting in such amounts or at such levels that they adversely affect neighboring residents, in commercial or residential areas, so as to be potentially harmful or injurious to human health or welfare or unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of life or property.""

In October 2016, the Department of Environmental Protection noted in an inspection report summary that Deltona's wastewater plant had a minor out-of-compliance issue because of a ""rising intermittent cycling noise"" that could be deemed offensive.

In February 2017, Matt Doan, the city's public works director at the time, emailed an environmental specialist with the Department of Environmental Protection about the various efforts the city made to reduce or manage noise at the wastewater plant after it was designed. Those efforts included rotating the generator 180 degrees so the exhaust would face away from Lawhun's home, changing the generator exercise start time and changing how often the air release valve blows.

Lawhun and his attorneys contend those efforts didn't improve things.

Parzych also said that while the wastewater treatment plant doesn't exceed the city's sound limits every second of the day, it does exceed them some of the time, and even when it's not louder than the limits, often it's barely under them.

""The problem that I see with this is that noise ordinances are put in place to be protective of the people, and what they (the city of Deltona) have done is interpret the ordinance to be protective of the noise maker,"" Parzych said.

B. Scott George, an attorney with Fowler, O'Quinn, Feeney and Sneed, P.A., the Orlando-based law firm representing the city, argued in a January 2019 memorandum that Lawhun's claims ""are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.""

Res judicata, according to Cornell Law School, is ""a matter that has been adjudicated by a competent court and may not be pursued further by the same parties.""

Lawhun's attorney Tanner Andrews said the city is arguing that Lawhun should've raised his noise issue with the wastewater plant in an earlier lawsuit he filed in January 2016 against Deltona regarding access to an easement that connects both the plant and Lawhun's property to 11th Avenue, which in turn connects with State Road 415. The issue with that argument, Andrews said, is the plant wasn't fully operating at that time, so Lawhun had no idea the level of noise that wastewater plant would emit at that time.

The final judgment in the 2016 easement case, which was filed in November 2018, was that the city couldn't block Lawhun's access to 11th Avenue at any time, court records show.

George also argues in the memorandum defending the city that the wastewater plant's noise is reasonable under common law nuisance doctrine, and Lawhun hasn't properly pleaded his case for relief or proved that it's necessary the court issue a permanent mandatory injunction against the city. Additionally, George argued that the court hearing the case was lacking in subject matter jurisdiction regarding the Florida Administrative Code's chapter on domestic wastewater facilities.

But Andrews said the plant's noise is a textbook example of a nuisance.

""It's hard to live in a house where there's so much racket you can't sleep,"" Andrews said. ""The zoning doesn't change the fact that it's producing way too much noise and thereby interfering with Mr. Lawhun's use of his property.""

In February, Volusia County Court Judge Christopher Kelly denied one of the three counts in the lawsuit and granted the city's motion for involuntary dismissal of the other two. Kelly said he wasn't sure res judicata applied in the nuisance case and was basing his ruling on Lawhun carrying the burden of persuasion, which Kelly didn't feel was met, according to court transcripts.

""I have no doubts whatsoever that Mr. Lawhun's use of the property has been disturbed by the building of the water treatment plant there,"" Kelly said, according to court transcripts. ""The question is, does it rise to the level of inducements and such that the law would support this court issuing a mandatory injunction directing the city to take certain steps?""

He said, they said

Lawhun said he knew when he purchased his property in April 2007 that the city was considering purchasing an adjacent parcel for a wastewater plant. He also said the city told him if the plant was constructed, it would be some distance from Lawhun's property, with plenty of trees in between.

While the agricultural zoning of the city's property allows for water treatment plants, the structure should ""in the absence of an appropriate natural vegetation screen, be visually screened from adjoining properties ... with an appropriate fence, decorative masonry or plant material,"" according to Detona's city code.

The small amount of vegetation the city planted between the wastewater plant and Lawhun's property does nothing to mitigate the treatment plant's noise, Parzych said.

""You have to have several hundred feet of trees that are mature, dense trees before you get any substantial noise reduction from buffering and vegetation,"" Parzych testified, according to court transcripts.

Parzych said the layout of the treatment facility was ""poorly designed,"" and ""there's things that could've been done to mitigate the noise."" But ""any time you put in mitigation, there's a cost associated with it.""

George, the city's attorney in the case, said if the city made efforts to lessen the sound just so Lawhun can enjoy his property, it could potentially open the city up to regulatory issues, court records show.

Trovato, who previously worked for the city, said the frequency of the sound has increased with the elevated usage of the plant.

""Nobody really cares at this point about what's going on,"" Trovato said. ""And since it's only one neighbor out in the woods, it's like 'maybe he'll just get tired and go away.'""",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190511/man-claims-deltona-wastewater-plant-noise-keeps-him-from-sleeping?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T11:11:35Z,Daytona Beach News,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA"
Mom accused of tossing newborn in dumpster held without bond,"A Brazilian woman who told Florida detectives she delivered a baby girl, then put the newborn in a plastic bag and tossed her into a dumpster was ordered to be held without bond Friday.

Palm Beach County sheriff's detectives arrested Rafaelle Alessandra Carbalho Sousa, 35, late Thursday on attempted murder and child abuse charges.

Earlier this week, the 6-pound, 8-ounce baby was found alive and taken to a local hospital. She is in custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families.

Sousa appeared Friday before 15th Judicial Circuit Judge Ted Booras, who ordered her not to have contact with the baby. A Portuguese interpreter translated Booras' orders.

A receipt from a beauty supply store, and a bundle of napkins with a large amount of blood in the same dumpster and in a garbage bag like the one where the baby was found led detectives to Sousa. The store gave the detectives the customer's information, leading them to the mother's address in Boca Raton, Florida.

Through a Portuguese translator, Sousa told detectives that she tried to get the baby to respond, waiting three hours for her to breathe. A report says she said she went back to the dumpster two times to make sure the baby was dead, but she never approached the bag because there were other people nearby.

A man interviewed at the residence where detectives served the warrant told them he ""had no idea"" Sousa was pregnant. The report says Sousa is a married nail technician who was born in Brazil.

Two maintenance workers heard the baby crying and found her in the dumpster Wednesday, the arrest report says. It's not clear how long the baby had been there or when she was delivered.

Under Florida law, newborns can be dropped off anonymously at a hospital or fire station with no questions asked.

The public defender's office is representing Sousa, but an attorney had yet to be assigned to the case.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/mom-accused-of-tossing-newborn-in-dumpster-held-without-bond,2019-05-10T18:20:59Z,Fox News,"1211 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10036"
Former Palm Bay deputy manager Dave Isnardi arrested,"PALM BAY, Fla. - An arrest warrant has been issued for former Palm Bay Deputy City Manager Dave Isnardi on charges of racketeering, conspiracy to commit extortion and conspiracy to possess controlled substances including oxycodone, News 6 partner Florida Today reported.

Isnardi is the husband of Brevard County Commissioner Kristine Isnardi.

It is unclear whether or not Isnardi has actually been arrested.

A second man, Jose Aguiar, a former candidate for the Palm Bay City Council, was arrested Friday morning and charged with racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering. Aguiar was convicted of conspiracy to sell cocaine in Massachusetts in 1997 and was sentenced to three years and one month in federal prison. It is not clear when he moved to Palm Bay.

The arrest warrants for the two show that the FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement have been investigating allegations of corruption and undue influence on city officials in Palm Bay since at least 2015. The warrants draw heavily from secret recordings made by a confidential source working with investigators.

The arrest warrants for the two paint a picture of Palm Bay’s city government embroiled in scandal. Though not arrested or charged, the warrants allege that City Councilman Jeff Bailey had an addiction to oxycodone and that former Councilman Tres Holton regularly had sex with prostitutes and used cocaine. It also alleges that Holton had obtained prostitutes for Mayor William Capote while the men were in Tallahassee.

The arrest warrants allege Isnardi and Aguiar were plotting to record Holton and Bailey having sex with prostitutes at “the Clubhouse,” a Canova Street home then owned by Aguiar, where Holton, Bailey and other Palm Bay officials hung out. They then planned to use those recordings to blackmail Holton and Bailey into voting the way Aguiar wanted on various issues including rezoning a property that Aguiar owned to allow him to open a scrap metal business that Isnardi would be a partner in.

“Is this a joke?” Holton said, when contacted by Florida Today and told the allegations against him in the arrest warrants. “You’re going to have to call me back,” Holton said, not responding further to questions.

The warrants also say that Isnardi and Aguiar plotted to plant drugs in Bailey’s car and arrange for a Brevard County sheriff’s deputy to perform a traffic stop on Bailey and to discover the drugs. The warrants also state that former City Manager Gregg Lynk was aware of the plot to set up Bailey, but didn’t want to know the details or participate in the effort.

Capote said he was surprised to learn from Florida Today that his name was mentioned in the arrest warrant as being connected with prostitutes.

He said those allegations are untrue.

“I don’t know who would tell someone that,” Capote said. “That’s profound. This is all new to me. That accusation has no validity.”

Capote said he has been in Tallahassee in the past on city business, meeting with state legislators and other state officials, but he did not hang out with Holton while he was there.

LAS VEGAS (KLAS) -- A Lake Tahoe man quit his job and is pursuing his dream of travel, but this time he has a life-saving message and some furry friends as companions.

His first stop was in Las Vegas. This is road trip number two for dog lover Lee Asher. He is crisscrossing the country -- in an RV -- with his nine rescue dogs. There is everything from a Saint Bernard to a Chihuahua. His message is simple. Adopt a dog. Save a life.

Asher visited the Nevada SPCA, a Las Vegas no kill shelter, Thursday to highlight some of the dogs that people often overlook, which include older dogs.

One dog, Cinnamon has lived half her life at the shelter waiting for a family to adopt her. Asher wants people to know that the dog you might see scared in a cage will blossom once it has a forever home.

""Whether the dog is barking or laying on its belly, the dog is in a very uncomfortable situation. Once you bring that dog home, it's completely different. No matter how much, how beautiful the dog looks, times that by 1,000 when you bring him into a home,"" Asher said.

His goal was to get 49 dogs adopted on his first mission. He ended up getting more than 200 dogs adopted.

Asher packed up Queen, Butters, Bobo, Cali, Penny, Molly, Tony, Lillie and Stella into the Asher house RV and set out to do it again. His thousands of fans on Facebook and Instagram follow their escapades -- and hope to meet them -- at shelters all over America.

He'll be on the road for the next four months. He is now headed to Texas and Florida with a lot of stops in between. Donations keep him going. However, more than money, he wants people to consider adopting an animal from a local shelter.

FOLEY, Ala. (WKRG) — The man accused of leading several agencies on a chase across Baldwin County on Thursday was in a stolen truck and may be linked to more crimes, according to Foley Police.

The chase was called off Thursday morning when the driver, identified as William McGinley, crossed into Florida. Later in the day, officers spotted McGinley was back in Baldwin County in the Miflin area. Police say he once again drove off toward Florida.

Foley Police worked with the Escambia County (FL) Sheriff's Office and located him near Highway 98 and Fairfield Drive, west of Pensacola.

They watched as McGinley drove back into Alabama, still in the same truck, which appeared to be breaking down from damage it sustained during the chase.

Police said McGinley got out of the truck and tried to run away. They say he resisted arrest as officers caught up with him.

The truck was recently stolen in Foley, police said. Investigators found evidence inside that could link McGinley to other crimes.

McGinley is facing charges that include attempting to elude, receiving stolen property, and several traffic violations.",http://www.wkrg.com/news/baldwin-county/new-details-chase-suspect-tried-to-run-away-after-stolen-truck-broke-down/1994675650,2019-05-10T17:19:07Z,WKRG,"555 Broadcast Dr, Mobile, AL 36606, USA"
"Former Palm Bay deputy manager Dave Isnardi arrested, charged with racketeering, other charges","CLOSE FLORIDA TODAY's Wayne Price talks about David Isnardi's resignation as deputy city manager of Palm Bay and how it will affect his wife, Brevard County Commissioner Kristine Isnardi. Video posted Aug. 29, 2017, by Jennifer Sangalang, FLORIDA TODAY. Wochit

Former Palm Bay Deputy City Manager Dave Isnardi has been arrested on charges of racketeering, conspiracy to commit extortion and conspiracy to possess controlled substances including oxycodone.

Isnardi is the husband of Brevard County Commissioner Kristine Isnardi.

A second man, Jose Aguiar, a former candidate for the Palm Bay City Council, was also arrested Friday morning and charged with racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering. Aguiar was convicted of conspiracy to sell cocaine in Massachusetts in 1997 and was sentenced to three years and one month in federal prison. It is not clear when he moved to Palm Bay.

The arrest warrants for the two show that the FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement have been investigating allegations of corruption and undue influence on city officials in Palm Bay since at least 2015. The warrants draw heavily from secret recordings made by a confidential source working with investigators.

The arrest warrants for the two paint a picture of Palm Bay’s city government embroiled in scandal. Though not arrested or charged, the warrants allege that City Councilman Jeff Bailey had an addiction to oxycodone and that former Councilman Tres Holton regularly had sex with prostitutes and used cocaine. It also alleges that Holton had obtained prostitutes for Mayor William Capote while the men were in Tallahassee.

The arrest warrants allege Isnardi and Aguiar were plotting to record Holton and Bailey having sex with prostitutes at “the Clubhouse,” a Canova Street home then owned by Aguiar, where Holton, Bailey and other Palm Bay officials hung out. They then planned to use those recordings to blackmail the Holton and Bailey into voting the way Aguiar wanted on various issues including rezoning a property that Aguiar owned to allow him to open a scrap metal business that Isnardi would be a partner in.

“Is this a joke?” Holton said, when contacted by FLORIDA TODAY and told the allegations against him in the arrest warrants. “You’re going to have to call me back,” Holton said, not responding further to questions.

The warrants also say that Isnardi and Aguiar plotted to plant drugs in Bailey’s car and arrange for a Brevard County sheriff’s deputy to perform a traffic stop on Bailey and to discover the drugs. The warrants also state that former City Manager Gregg Lynk was aware of the plot to set up Bailey, but didn’t want to know the details or participate in the effort.

The warrants also indicate that Aguiar had previously supplied Bailey with drugs.

In a subsequent interview with the FBI, set up by Isnardi's attorney John Murphy, Isnardi admitted to participating in discussions about trying to record Holton and Bailey in compromising positions, according to the arrest documents.

But he denied there was an actual plot plant drugs in Bailey's car. He did admit, though, that contacted Brevard County Sheriff's Office Agent Jason West about the possibility that there were drugs in Bailey's car and noted that Bailey ""was doing drugs anyway.

Ultimately, Isnardi claimed the plot was only ""guys talking s---, drinking beers and smoking cigars,"" according to the arrest documents.

Capote said he was surprised to learn from FLORIDA TODAY that his name was mentioned in the arrest warrant as being connected with prostitutes.

He said those allegations are untrue.

“I don’t know who would tell someone that,” Capote said. “That’s profound. This is all new to me. That accusation has no validity.”

Capote said he has been in Tallahassee in the past on city business, meeting with state legislators and other state officials, but he did not hang out with Holton while he was there.

Capote says people may have been trying to taint him for political reasons.

Capote said he was never interviewed by investigators, and that he has no reason to secure a lawyer in this matter.

PENSACOLA, Fla. -

A Florida man accused of torturing his girlfriend’s 2-year-old daughter while wearing a werewolf mask died Tuesday, six days after he attempted suicide in his jail cell, authorities said.

Andrew Bennett Ross-Celaius, 37, of Pensacola, was hospitalized May 1 after spending nearly a month behind bars. Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan told The Pensacola News Journal that Ross-Celaius was found hanging in his cell around 11 p.m. that night.

The inmate was taken to a local hospital, where family members opted to remove life support Tuesday, Morgan told the newspaper. He died at 1:13 p.m. that day.

The sheriff said a preliminary investigation indicates Ross-Celaius’ injuries were self-inflicted. Surveillance footage and activity logs showed deputies had been walking the cell blocks and inspecting individual cells according to policy, the newspaper reported.

Morgan said Ross-Celaius used something available in his cell to hang himself but declined to say what he used.

Ross-Celaius was arrested April 9 and charged with six counts of aggravated child abuse, four counts of child abuse, a variety of drug charges, possession of a weapon, tampering with evidence and a probation violation, according to the Escambia County Sheriff’s Office. Another man, Eric Everett Furnans, 36, of Pensacola, was arrested April 30 and charged with destroying evidence in the case after Ross-Celaius was taken into custody. Furnans was later booked on drug charges.

Eric Everett Furnans Escambia County Sheriff's Office

Morgan said last week that the evidence Furnans is accused of destroying is cellphones that contained images of the alleged abuse. Investigators believe Furnans acted at the request of Ross-Celaius, who contacted him from jail.

Morgan said investigators were also looking into suspicions of possible sexual abuse committed against the young victim.

Editor’s note: The following contains graphic details of alleged child abuse that may be difficult for some readers.

‘Systematic abuse, if not torture’

Morgan said the allegations against Ross-Celaius began in the emergency room of Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola after the girl’s mother, identified by WEAR-TV as Maranda Lyn Mixson, 27, of Cantonment, took her there April 5 for treatment of what she said she thought was ringworm.

“When she took the child to the ER, the ER physicians, who are well versed in spotting child abuse, quickly determined that was not any form of ringworm. It was abuse,” Morgan said. “In this case, it was burn marks.”

WEAR-TV reported that hospital staff told deputies the burn marks resembled marks made by an e-cigarette. When Mixson was asked about the marks, she “was very hostile and stated the circle marks were ringworm,” according to an arrest report obtained by the news station.

In addition to the burn marks, Mixson’s daughter had bruises on her stomach, back, arms, elbows, legs and forehead. A large bruise across the girl’s throat appeared to be a rope burn, the station reported.

Maranda Lyn Mixson Escambia County Sheriff's Office

Mixson was arrested for child neglect but jail records show she was released on $5,000 bond two days later. Sheriff’s Office detectives launched an investigation into the girl’s injuries.

Morgan said the alleged abuse by Ross-Celaius was captured on video and stored in the cloud. Some of the recordings may have been shared with other people, the sheriff said.

The sheriff characterized the abuse as “indescribable.”

“It’s the thing nightmares are made of, and no child should ever be subjected to this,” Morgan said.

Chief Deputy Chip Simmons said investigators who went to the child’s home spotted surveillance equipment and cameras, for which they obtained search warrants. What they found was horrifying, he said.

“We found some systematic harassment, if not torture, of a 2-year-old child as this child tried to sleep,” Simmons said.

The chief deputy said video footage showed the child being woken from a sound sleep by having bottles of milk -- some full, some half full -- thrown at her in an overhand fashion. The objects struck the child, waking her and making her cry.

Ross-Celaius was seen in other footage shooting the child with an airsoft gun as she slept, “for no other reason but to wake the child up and to hurt the child,” according to Simmons.

Pictured in a 2013 Street View image is the home on Betty Road in Pensacola, Fla., where authorities allege Andrew Bennett Ross-Celaius, 37, abused and tortured his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter. Google

The girl was also forced to wear a dog training collar, which emits an electric shock to force an animal into submission.

“You can hear the sounds of the dog collar being activated, and then the shrieking and the pain that the child has suffered as a result of this,” Simmons said.

Worse still was footage of Ross-Celaius burning the girl with a small torch, he said.

“I have been in law enforcement for over 30 years, and when I looked at the evidence that we saw here, me and members of my staff were speechless,” Simmons said. “When you look at this, it hits you in the heart and you wonder how anyone can be so mean.”

Morgan said Ross-Celaius tried to achieve a higher level of terror by wearing a werewolf mask as he tortured the girl.

“If you want to think of something you could do to a child to terrorize her, this child lived through that,” the sheriff said.

Simmons said his investigators were still combing through the evidence found on multiple storage drives. Additional charges were pending against Ross-Celaius when he died.

The victim in the current case was not the first toddler Ross-Celaius is accused of harming. According to WKRG in Mobile, Ross-Celaius was charged with murder in the June 24, 2006, death of 2-year-old Kyler Janes after the boy, whose relationship to Ross-Celaius was not immediately known, was hospitalized with bruises all over his body and bleeding in his brain and eyes.

The boy had been seen in the emergency room at Sacred Heart Hospital five times before for a variety of injuries.

Ross-Celaius was tried for the baby’s murder but found not guilty, the news station said.

"Dog walker, 5 dogs killed when man fleeing police slams into car","Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Pet owners and others gathered at a Southern California intersection to mourn a popular dog walker killed along with five of six dogs she was transporting when a motorist fleeing police crashed into her car.

Dog owners and friends of Jessica Bingaman held candles and sang at a Wednesday night vigil in Long Beach, south of Los Angeles.

“She was a beloved human being that cared for dogs; that cared for everybody,” an emotional Ann Hovatter told KABC-TV .

Hovatter’s dog Scout was among the pets killed.

“She loved Jessie so much,” Hovatter told KTLA-TV as she showed a photo of her German shepherd.

Bingaman’s mother arrived from Frackville, Pennsylvania, and was amazed by the turnout. “I know she was loved,” said Donann Lawson.

Lawson told KCBS-TV in an interview before the vigil that seeing video of the suspect sitting handcuffed on the curb while her daughter had to be cut out of the wreck “did no justice for me.” She also said she understands police have a job to do, but questioned what warrants a pursuit.

Police Chief Robert Luna came to the vigil and spoke to the mother, the station reported.

“On behalf of the men and women of the Long Beach Police Department — our condolences. We’re hurt, and to mom, I’m so sorry. On behalf of our city, so sorry,” he said.

Alisha Blanchard, a friend of the victim, said she created a GoFundMe page to raise funds for Bingaman’s 10-year-old daughter as well as the families’ whose dogs died.

The crash happened Tuesday morning as officers were pursuing a stolen van whose driver refused to stop, police said.

Bingaman, 41, was pronounced dead at a hospital. Four dogs died at the scene and a fifth died at a pet hospital.

A police statement said the sixth dog was released from the hospital to its owners.

After treatment for minor injuries, Javier Olivarez, 43, of Los Angeles was booked into jail for investigation of evading a police officer, felony DUI, vehicular manslaughter, and grand theft auto. Police said he also had an outstanding no-bail warrant for violation of a supervision order following release from a case involving a robbery. No details of that matter were provided.

The police statement said detectives were expected to present their case to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office. Olivarez remained jailed with no bail. It was unclear if he had retained legal representation.",http://www.wfla.com/national/dog-walker-5-dogs-killed-when-man-fleeing-police-slams-into-car/1994040557,2019-05-10T08:37:08Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"
A child abuser faked a Golden Gate Bridge suicide. The three-year manhunt ended in Key West.,"

Three years after his disappearance in California (left), Michael Patrick Manning was discovered this month in Florida (right). ((Chico Police/Monroe Sheriff) /(Chico Police/Monroe Sheriff))

The tripped alarm triggered a call to police. It was last Friday, around 1:30 a.m., just outside Key West, Fla. Deputies from the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office pulled onto Shrimp Road, a sweaty strip of broken concrete on Stock Island where a large hangar-like industrial building squatted across from a canal.

As the sheriff’s office detailed in a recent news release, the deputies picking through the property discovered an unlocked storage trailer sitting off to the side of the main building. A man — his short light hair messed up, his face charred red from the sun and dotted with small cuts — was living inside.

He told the Monroe deputies his name was William Wallace Littlejohn. He said he had no identification. No record came back when the deputies punched his name into the system. They were dealing with a mystery man.

Searching through the trailer, the deputies discovered a military contractor ID card in the name William W. Littlejohn. They also found checks written out in the name, as well as a U.S. passport. The deputies, however, felt the documentation was fake. When they ran the details through a U.S. Border Patrol system, Littlejohn turned out to be a man living in Utah.

The individual from the trailer refused to speak to deputies, and he was booked into the local jail as “John Doe,” held on suspicion of giving police a false name.

Palm-shaded and joyfully beer-sloshed, Key West’s debauched reputation as a Tommy Bahama-clad vacation destination runs parallel to another identity as the perfect place to lay low. As the southernmost point in the continental United States, the Florida Keys have been longtime safe havens for drifters, burnouts, fugitives and anyone eager to live as far off the grid as possible.

But the man from the trailer did not remain a John Doe for long. Running his fingerprints, Monroe County deputies learned he had been wanted by the U.S. Marshals Service for the last three years — in reality, he was 58-year-old Michael Patrick Manning.

In 2015, Manning had been charged in California with both sexually abusing a minor under the age of 14 and creating child pornography. But he had slipped away from authorities the next year after elaborately staging a suicide at the Golden Gate Bridge, more than 3,200 miles from the trailer where he was recently discovered.

Manning’s problems with the law began when he was living in Chico, Calif., a Central Valley city of around 112,000 north of Sacramento. In 2015, the local police department began investigating him after a young woman said she had been sexually assaulted by Manning in 2008 and 2009, when she was between 12 to 14 years old, according to a recent news release from the Chico Police Department.

On Sept. 3, 2015, Manning was arrested on "" multiple counts of lewd and lascivious acts with a minor under the age of 14,” the Chico Enterprise-Record reported at the time.

During his arrest, police searched his home. According to the Enterprise-Record, investigators discovered more than 600 images of child pornography at the residence. He was later charged with possessing and manufacturing child pornography, the Chico police news release said. He posted a $215,000 bail and was let out of jail.

More than a year later, in June 2016, Manning pleaded no contest to the charges he faced, including oral copulation of a person under 14, possession of more than 600 images of child/youth pornography, and two counts of solicitation of a minor to engage in the preparation of sexual images, the Enterprise-Record reported. His sentencing date in Butte County Superior Court was scheduled for Oct. 6, 2016.

Manning was a no-show at his court date.

The next day, about a three-hour drive south of Chico in San Francisco, members of the National Park Service discovered an abandoned car near the Golden Gate Bridge, according to the Chico police release. The car was a rental taken out in Manning’s name. Inside, they discovered a suicide note written in the wanted man’s hand.

Authorities did not buy the scenario. A search turned up no body. So police tapped the FBI and the Marshals Service Fugitive Task Force to help track Manning down. According to the release from Chico law enforcement, the hunt hopscotched across California — Yuba City, Sacramento, San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland and Alameda.

Investigators believed a “close associate” of Manning was helping the fugitive slip away. This same associate “was involved in international travel,” according to the release. Investigators seemed always to just miss Manning.

“Residences, storage facilities, and vehicles tied to Manning’s associate were frequently found full of personal property, and hastily abandoned,” the release noted. Authorities believe they once almost caught up him at a marina in Alameda, Calif.

Since his 2016 disappearance, it is unclear why or how Manning traveled to Florida, or much less his final destination, a storage trailer in Key West. After his arrest in Florida last week, he was charged locally with giving law enforcement a false name and identification.

His extradition back to California is underway.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/05/10/child-abuser-faked-golden-gate-bridge-suicide-three-year-manhunt-ended-key-west/,2019-05-10T06:00:20Z,Washington Post,"1301 K St NW, Washington, DC 20071"

Florida State coach Willie Taggart discusses state of the program during Fort Myers trip,"CLOSE FSU football coach Willie Taggart visited Fort Myers during Seminoles Boosters 2019 Spring Tour on Thursday. Adam Regan, AREGAN@NEWS-PRESS.COM

Willie Taggart wasn’t hiding Thursday. The Florida State coach wasn’t ducking any questions from any Seminoles fans.

In fact, that’s what the Seminoles Boosters 2019 Spring Tour that kicked off in Fort Myers at the IMAG museum is all about.

Facetime with loyal supporters, discussing the state of the football program, answering questions and concerns they had about a team that missed out on a bowl game for the first time in 36 years in Taggart’s first season.

Taggart characterized 2018 as a teaching moment for his staff and players, but emphasized the focus was on 2019 while speaking to local alumni.

""We've moved on. We don't live there anymore,"" Taggart said of the 5-7 2018 campaign. ""We're in 2019. This is a totally different team and we understand the issues we have and we're working to correct those things. And we've made improvement in those things.

""Again, we're not going to be able to show everyone until the season starts. But we know within ourselves that we're doing the thing that it takes to be able to be the winning team that we all want. One thing we can't do is stay on '18. We have to move forward.""

After the Dunbar High band serenaded fans with the FSU fight song, Taggart faced questions about the program head on about the program’s status as the worst Power 5 program when it comes to APR (Academic Progress Rate), discussed his recent success on the recruiting trail as well as his staff’s dominance over Florida and Miami in recruiting Lee County.

The former USF and Oregon coach described FSU as his dream job when he was hired in December 2017 following the departure of national championship-winning coach Jimbo Fisher to Texas A&M. And with that job came high expectations.

“You don’t want to be at a place where they don’t care,” said Taggart, who added the job was everything he wanted it to be.

With Fisher’s departure, there were some issues the new staff understood it had to clean up.

FSU saw its multi-year APR fall to 936 after posting a single-year APR of 922 for 2017-18. Should it drop below 930 the Seminoles could be in danger of not being eligible to participate in championships according to NCAA rules.

""We're making sure our guys are going to class and we're recruiting the right guys who want to come there for both,"" Taggart said. ""I think, more importantly, it's holding our guys accountable. Our guys had a heck of a semester in the classroom. We had 29 guys get their personal best this semester. We had over 24 guys with over a 3.0 or better. That's just with 87 guys on the team.

CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalism

""I think with the APR you don't get there in one year and you don't change it in one year. But you put a plan together and you work to get it done. We've always had a plan. Academics have always been first. No matter where we were we're going to work to get it better and it will be better. I think as that gets better you'll see better play as well.""

In terms of recruiting, Taggart and his staff jumped 10 spots to No. 4 in the 247Sports composite team rankings with five recent commitments of four-star wide receiver Malachi Wideman, four-star cornerback Jalen Harrell, four-star Jaylon McCluster, three-star defensive end Josh Griffis and three-star Derek Bermudez.

""Our recruits are showing they're enjoying this too and excited about Florida State and where we're going,"" said Taggart, who couldn’t comment on any specific recruit. ""I think you're seeing young men that want to be a part of the culture, want to be a part of the vision we have and get Florida State football back to where it belongs.""

Taggart, a Bradenton native, particularly has had success recruiting the Fort Myers area, bringing a number of recruits to USF and was instrumental in helping bring Fort Myers High running back Darrian Felix to Oregon.

""These young guys down here, they love football. Football is really important to them,"" Taggart said. ""They're coached well by some good coaches. I think those are the guys you want playing the game of football, the guys that love to compete. Tough guys, not just physically but mentally as well.""

He was thrilled four-star Lehigh defensive end Quashon Fuller stuck with the Seminoles over Alabama this past National Signing Day.

""Besides he's a good football player, I think he's a great young man who loves Florida State University,"" Taggart said. ""I think it's important as we continue to build our program and built the culture the way that we want to we get really good football players who love Florida State University. He's a young man who's been committed to us for a long time. He stayed true to us. To me, those kind of guys are going to give you everything you have and make sure we play like we're supposed to.""

So, what should Seminoles fans expect of FSU this year as they open with Boise State in Jacksonville on Aug. 31?

That was the question Taggart was waiting on.

""We should expect the football team we all wanted,"" Taggart said. ""That we've all wanted for a long time and that's a winning football team. A team that's playing with passion, playing Florida State football. The thing is you're not going to see that team unless you're there. Be there, support us like we know you will.

Investigators in South Florida are looking for a man who dumped a bag of kittens next to a restaurant dumpster in Palm Beach County last week.“Three little kittens all balled up, all wet and stuck together,” said Mel Pfirman, a cook.Mel Pfirman is the cook at the Cup and Saucer Café at the corner of Lantana and Jog roads.“I came out to dump the grease and thought I heard something, little mauling, crying sound,” said Pfirman.He didn’t think anything of it, until he noticed a brown paper bag between the two dumpsters. “It was folded over so I looked at it because it looked odd, when I was standing there I heard something again, looked like the bag kind of moved, so I walked over and grabbed it, and felt weight it in, so I opened it up,” said Pfirman.Inside, three scared kittens.“Animal abandonment is a crime in the state of Florida, and this is a situation that we would prosecute someone for, so we need to know who they are and put the rest of the pieces of the puzzle together. But there is no excuse for leaving animals in bag next to a dumpster, this was a brown paper bag balled up, they couldn’t escape, they couldn’t fend for themselves,"" said Capt. David Walesky, with Animal Care and Control.Officials say the suspect was driving a newer model, white Audi. He faces three counts of abandoning an animal if caught. ""We are treating them for parasites, they were a little dehydrated when they were first found so we are working through those issues, and in a matter of a few weeks, they will be able to be spayed and neutered and hopefully they will find them homes from there pretty quickly,” said Walesky.Once they are healthy enough, they will be given back to the pet store, next to the restaurant, which helped care for them.

"Dog dragged from back of truck suffers road rashes, bloody paws; homeless driver, 58, charged, police say","A Florida homeless man was arrested on animal cruelty charges Wednesday after allegedly dragging a pit bull behind his pick-up truck, badly injuring the dog.

Police said Gregory Tousignant, 58, was driving while his pit bull was standing in the bed of the truck. Witnesses saw the 1-year-old pup named Ollie jump from the truck, and then get dragged by a rope tied to his collar before slipping out of the collar.

Florida dog dragging suspect in custody,"- A man accused of dragging a pit bull behind his truck in Spring Hill is now in custody.

Gregory Tousignant, 58, was arrested on Wednesday night, according to jail records.

Deputies in Hernando County say Tousignant, a transient, is the man who dragged a 1-year-old dog behind his moving truck before the animal slipped out of his collar.

""He came loose and flew into the median at which point he was rescued,"" wrote Jan Harwood, owner of Nature Coast Animal Wellness & Surgical Center, who witnessed it.

The dog, now named Ollie, was rushed to the vet clinic where he has been recovering from severe road rashes on his body as well as bloody paws.

“He’s doing really well, he doesn’t have any broken bones or internal injuries,” Harwood said.

Michael Terry, a spokesman for the Hernando Sheriff’s Office, says this doesn’t appear to be intentional because the dog was standing in the bed of the truck before jumping. A rope was tied to his collar.

“[Witnesses] saw the dog jump out of the truck as he was traveling down the road, and they actually tried to stop him. [Tousignant] didn’t hear him,” Terry said.

It is illegal in Florida to carry a pet in the bed of a truck that is not properly secured.

Man accused of breaking into Wilton Manors thrift store,"WILTON MANORS, Fla. - A man has been arrested after detectives said he broke into a popular Wilton Manors thrift shift shop that funds a nonprofit organization last month.

According to police spokesperson Jennifer Bickhardt, Devante Allen was arrested early Wednesday morning and taken to the Broward County Jail.

Allen faces a charge of burglary.

Surveillance video from April 14 shows a man in a T-shirt and shorts breaking into the front door of the Hidden Treasures Thrift Store in the 2200 block of Northwest Ninth Avenue, then taking the cash register once he makes his way inside.

Executive Director Sue Martino said she received a phone call from her alarm company and directed them to call police.

Martino said proceeds from the thrift store fund the Pet Project, a nonprofit organization that helps people who can't take care of their pets because of illness or financial hardship.

"Social Security impostor scam: It's growing, and this is how they trick you","CLOSE The FTC is warning of a new phone scam where the caller will fake a call from the SSA to trick you into giving up your personal information. ERIC ROGERS/TCPALM Eric Rogers, Florida Today

To scammers, your Social Security number is gold-plated and diamond-encrusted asset, and now they have a new way to try to steal yours and get paid.

Consumer advocates are raising an alert about a twist to an old impostor phone scam. It's called the ""Social Security impostor scam."" A blog at the Federal Trade Commission recently wrote: ""In the shady world of government, the SSA scam may be the new IRS scam.""

Your Social Security number is a precious asset. (Photo: Kameleon007, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Here's how it works:

You get a call with a warning that your Social Security number has been suspended because of suspicious activity or because it's been used in a crime. You are asked to confirm you number or told you need to withdraw money from the bank and buy gift cards.

The phone call may be a robocaller with a message to ""press 1"" to speak with a ""support representative"" from the government to reactivate your Social Security number. The scammers use technology to spoof your Caller ID to make it look like the Social Security Administration is really calling.

In the last 12 months, people filed more than 76,000 complaints about Social Security impostors, reporting $19 million in losses. The median reported loss last year was $1,500, the FTC said.

People are asked to give up the personal identification numbers (PINs) on the back of gift cards or use virtual currencies like Bitcoin to pay. (According to the FTC's consumer alert, people withdrew money and fed cash into Bitcoin automatic teller machines.)

After handing over the gift card numbers to the ""Social Security office,"" one consumer interviewed by Fraud.org was told he would receive a refund equal to the amount he paid to unfreeze his account from the Federal Reserve. Of course, the refund never came and the man lost nearly $20,000.

Readers of Press on Your Side know that once you hand over gift card PINs or wire money to a scammer, your cash is gone.

""One scammer will try a new twist on an old scam or try one new wrinkle that gets them more money,"" said John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecommunications and fraud with the National Consumers League. ""Scammers like to keep up with the Joneses when it comes to using the latest techniques to defraud consumers.""

The scammers can be clever. With numerous data breaches that have hit corporate America, fraudsters may already have accurate personal information about you, including your real Social Security number, Breyault said. The information is used to build trust and make the call seem more legitimate, he added.

According to Fraud.org and the FTC, here are some important things to remember:

Don't trust your phone's caller ID. Scammers can make it look as if the Social Security Administration is calling and even use the agency's real number.

Don't give your Social Security number, other personal information, to a caller on the phone.

Social Security will never suspend your number, according to Fraud.org. If anyone tells you something different, you're being scammed.

Social Security will never call you and demand money. No government agency will demand you pay something using gift cards or Bitcoin either.

If you have a question, check with the real Social Security Administration. The administration will never contact you out of the blue. The agency's number is 1-800-772-1213.

Talk about the scam with friends, family and neighbors. Report government impostor scams to the FTC at ftc.gov/complaint.

Mayfaire by-the-Lake art fest draws thousands,"LAKELAND — Alexis Rayelle has driven from Tampa every year for about the past six years for one thing: to shop at the annual Mayfaire by-the-Lake art festival, a juried show that features $17,000 in cash prizes.

""I love all the artists,"" said Rayelle, sporting a colorful lace scarf and straw hat with a red ribbon.

She also loves to have conversations with the artists. ""The artists are so friendly,"" she said.

Rayelle said she likes to create things as well, and does a lot of sewing.

""I bought a scarf from Foxxy Chic six or seven years ago, and I plan to look for another one,"" she said.

The banks of Lake Morton draw thousands for the two-day, Mother's Day weekend show with some 165 artists, including 46 who were new to Mayfaire by-the-Lake.

Gillian Fazio, who grew up in Lakeland, attending Rochelle School of the Arts, Lois Cowles Harrison Center for the Visual and Performing Arts, and Lakeland High School, she eventually made her way to the University of Florida.

This was Fazio's first year displaying her art at the show, she said, and she admits she was a little nervous.

""I didn't have pro-panels to display my art,"" she said, noting she took a six-hour drive Thursday night to pick up her panels.

While at UF, she said, she had always dabbled in art, drawing, and painting, but as a college student, she said, ""I can do this,"" and went for a bachelor's degree in fine art.

She works at Painting with A Twist, and does art on the side. Classifying herself as a ""studio artist and muralist,"" she said she took part in Lakeland's Tapestries program recently.

Then there is Andre La Salle of New Orleans, Louisiana, who said this is only his fourth show ""on the road.""

His metal works of art could be thought of as simiiar to Steampunk, but he describes his art as more like taking ""modern"" pieces of the world we live in"" to create his works.

Skulls, butterflies, gears, and other symbols are part of his art. He said he prefers to sell art face to face.

A serious artist, he said he considers his works his children, and said he likes to know where they are going.

Can he tell a serious buyer from an onlooker?

""I can read people's body language,"" he said. ""and their relationship to my work. They may love it, but it has no place for them.""

But there are others who immediately connect with a piece. ""Their eyes lock on a piece and they are unable to separate themselves from it,"" he said.

Art buyers were out in number Saturday, as many carried a canvas, or a sculpture. One man carried his large and quite heavy metal spider he just purchased, with a smile on his face and no time to talk.

Not every artist was a newcomer to Mayfaire-by-the-Lake. Lorrie Mason, a metal crafter of gold, silver, and copper, has been to Mayfaire numerous times, and said she used to be a vocational rehabilitation counselor. She also has a degree in psychology, but she left all that to become a stay-at-home mom. It was then she took her hobby to a new level for income, she said.

Mason said she is the kind of person who sees trash on the side of the road and wants to rescue it and fix it. Her findings, and things her friends give her like old skeleton keys, became the media for her work.

""I am astounded to call myself a jeweler and an artist,"" she said. Three years ago, she opened her boutique, ""On the Fringe,"" in Tampa to sell her jewelry, ""groovy clothing,"" and local products.

Andrew Clever, a youth worker with Lake Morton Community Church, was busy providing free parking and bottled water to the community, and said the event is always well attended. The church sought to be a help, as many either would avoid parking in the church's lot because they did not know they could, or they would park here and there, and it would be a mess. Clever said the church had assigned someone to help people park.

A family- and pet-friendly event, dogs here and there could be seen munching on ice cubes provided by their owners.

A 3-year-old yellow lab named ""Chuck"" wore a royal blue scarf that said ""Don't just stand there, pet me,"" and toured the show with his owner, Cynthia Grimes of Lakeland. ""Almost every weekend, I take him to an event,"" she said. Chuck made his way to other well behaved art show dogs, on leashes beside their owners, as Grimes chatted with various people she met and children who wanted to give Chuck a hug. ""He loves the attention,"" she said.

With temperatures in the low 90s, one person said the show is often called the ""bake by the lake"" by some artists because of the heat. But organizers of the show did much to cool things down with numerous ""Power Breezers"" that misted cool air and water for anyone who wanted to stand in front of them. The line at one Breezer increased as the noon hour approached, as some made their way to various tents and chairs with cold drinks and food they purchased from vendors. Proceeds from the sale of the food and beverages help support the programs of the Polk Museum of Art at Florida Southern College. Shade trees along some of the sidewalks beside Lake Morton provided comfort and scenery as well.

Shuttle service was provided free from Florida Southern College.

The event, presented by Polk Musuem of Art, was sponsored by Citizens Bank & Trust. For more information on Mayfaire-by-the-Lake, visit www.mayfairebythelake.org. Mayfaire-by-the-Lake will run on Sunday as well, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Ormond Beach man charged in Flagler hit-run death,"An Ormond Beach man suspected of being the driver in a hit-and-run accident last year that killed a Flagler County school bus driver was arrested Thursday and charged with leaving the scene of an accident with death.

BUNNELL — An Ormond Beach man suspected of being the driver in a hit-and-run crash in 2018 that killed a Flagler County school bus driver was being held in the Flagler County jail Friday charged with leaving the scene of an accident with death, booking records show.

Brian Brown, 59, of Sunny Shore Drive in Ormond Beach, was arrested Thursday. His bail was set at $25,000.

[READ ALSO: Flagler school bus driver killed in I-95 hit-run wreck]

Florida Highway Patrol investigators described Brown as ""remorseful"" when they tracked him down the day after the March 26, 2018, hit-and-run crash on Interstate 95 in Flagler County.

Troopers armed with a search warrant showed up at Brown's Sunny Shore Drive home and seized the 2010 Jeep Wrangler they suspected he was driving when it crashed into a Toyota Corolla that had struck a guard rail and veered into northbound traffic.

[READ ALSO: Suspect found in hit-run wreck that killed Flagler school bus driver]

Raymond Almodovar, 68, of Ormond Beach, a Flagler County school bus driver, was driving the Toyota and died at the scene.

Witnesses told troopers that the driver of the Wrangler got out to assess the damages before climbing back into his vehicle and leaving.



Brown told troopers who showed up at his house the next day that he left the scene of the accident because he had a suspended license and stated, ""it's me, I had my boss give you guys a call.""

Almodovar was a well-known bus driver who had worked for the Flagler County school district since July 2013. He drove three routes, ferrying students at Flagler Palm Coast High, Buddy Taylor Middle and Old Kings Elementary schools.

The crash occurred at mile marker 282, about a mile south of State Road 100 in Palm Coast, just before 6 a.m. March 26 and closed the interstate’s northbound lanes as far south as northern Volusia County for several hours.

PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man accused of torturing his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter by burning her, shooting her with a BB gun and wearing a werewolf mask to scare her has killed himself.

Jury finds Florida man guilty in alleged sleepwalking homicide,"A 12-person jury found Randy Herman Jr., 26, guilty of first-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Brooke Preston in March 25, 2017.

After about five hours of deliberations, a 12-person jury found Randy Herman Jr. guilty of first-degree murder this week in the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Brooke Preston in 2017, rejecting the defense that he was sleepwalking when he attacked her in suburban West Palm Beach.

After the verdict was read Wednesday, both Preston’s family and Herman’s family teared up silently on opposite sides of the courtroom as Circuit Judge John Kastrenakes thanked the jury for its service of more than a week in the case. Before the judge sentenced Herman, 26, to the mandatory term of life in prison, Preston’s sister, Jordan, spoke briefly before the court.

As she tried to stifle her tears, she explained nothing has been the same since her sister was killed. The sisters and Herman had know each other since they were teenagers and lived together for more than six months at the home where she was attacked. Jordan Preston was not in the residence at the time of the fatal stabbing.

“The last few years without her have been awful. Our lives are totally different,” she said.

Outside the courtroom, Preston’s father, John, walked surrounded by more than a dozen family members and friends who came down from Pennsylvania for the trial.

“There’s no winners in this whole situation. Everybody’s losers,” he said.

Herman and his lawyers had argued he was sleepwalking when he stabbed Preston more than 20 times on the morning of March 25, 2017, and should be found not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors told the jury Herman’s actions were deliberate and not the product of an alleged sleepwalking episode.

Investigators said Preston had finished packing up and was ready to move to New York when Herman sent her a text message, asking her to pick up a shirt before she left to give to a friend. When Herman testified last week, he said he thought Preston had come back to the house that morning, he had given her a shirt, then they had hugged goodbye, she left and he went back to sleep.

“The next thing (I know), I’m standing over top of her and I have a knife in my hand, covered in blood,” Herman said. “I was confused. Scared. Didn’t know what to do. Didn’t know what happened.”

Herman then drove to a nearby park, called 911 and told them that even though he didn’t remember what had happened, he said he must have been the one that killed Preston because no one else was home.

Over the course of the trial, which began with testimony April 30, the jury heard from Palm Beach County sheriff’s detectives; Herman; Jordan Preston; Kyle McGregor, the man who last saw Preston alive; as well as from experts who testified both for against the sleepwalking defense.

In his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant Public Defender Joseph Walsh said there was no logical answer to what happened. There was no motive, no history of violence and no issues between Herman and Preston.

“There is no other rational explanation for this killing other than this could have been sleepwalking,” Walsh said.

Dr. Charles Patrick Ewing, a forensic psychologist, testified Monday that he was “truly puzzled” by the case until he learned of Herman’s history of sleepwalking.

“That really made sense to me, because I really couldn’t make any other sense of the case,” Ewing said.

He said while sleepwalking is uncommon and sleepwalking homicides are even less likely, they do happen and Herman met the criteria: The person attacked was well-loved by the attacker, there appeared to be no motive in the case, Herman said he couldn’t remember anything from the attack and he had a history of sleepwalking.

Herman’s mother, Kathi Adams, testified that she had witnessed several episodes as Herman was a child, but Jordan Preston said in the years she had known him and lived with him, she never saw him sleepwalk.

On Tuesday, prosecutors had Dr. Wade C. Myers, a forensic psychiatrist, testify and say that there’s no way Herman could have slept through the 20-plus stabs he inflicted on Preston because it was too complex of an action.

Instead, he suggested the motive in the killing may be sexually based, drawing from an alleged incident the night before the stabbing where Herman reportedly hid in Brooke Preston’s closet naked after a day of drinking heavily. No one saw the alleged incident and it was only known because Preston reportedly told McGregor and asked to spend the night with him.

Preston’s sister testified that there was no sexual or romantic interested between herself, her sister or Herman.

Over the years, there have been several high-profile murder cases where those accused have claimed sleepwalking as a defense for their actions and have had their juries rule both for and against them.

In 2015, Joseph Mitchell was found not guilty of strangling his 4-year-old son to death after his attorneys argued he was sleepwalking at the time of the attack in North Carolina. In 1999, an Arizona man was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of his wife after he claimed he was sleepwalking when he stabbed her and then dragged her to the pool and held her head under water.

During his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant State Attorney Reid Scott said Herman was not sleepwalking and that he knew what he was doing.

“This is skin, this is bone, this is muscle (he’s stabbing,)” he said. “You’re not going to sleepwalk through that.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/zz/news/20190510/jury-finds-florida-man-guilty-in-alleged-sleepwalking-homicide?rssfeed=true,2019-05-10T04:20:00Z,Sarasota Herald,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA"

Video: Man throws concrete paver through woman's car window,"- Deputies say they are looking for the man who threw a concrete landscaping paver through the driver's side window of a woman's car.

In surveillance video released by the sheriff's office, the man can be heard yelling at the woman to return his property, however, it's not clear to what property he is referring.

""Give me my [explitive!] Give me my [explitive]!"" the man yells at the woman after smashing the block into her vehicle.

The video, recorded Thursday, May 8, shows a tan vehicle parked sideways on San Miguel Drive in Port Richey, Florida. A black car is parked on the roadway in front of the tan car. The man, standing with his hand on the side of the tan vehicle, appears to yell at the person driving the black vehicle.

""Back up! Back up! Back up!"" he yells.

Then he sprints toward a house where some landscaping pavers are stacked. He picks one up and runs back toward the tan vehicle, smashing it into the window.

He then reaches into the vehicle and begins screaming at the woman.

She can be heard insisting she does not have the man's property.

The Pasco County Sheriff's Office said the incident was a case of road rage, but it's unclear how the incident began.

Florida State coach Willie Taggart discusses the state of the program in Fort Myers trip,"CLOSE FSU football coach Willie Taggart visited Fort Myers during Seminoles Boosters 2019 Spring Tour on Thursday. Adam Regan, AREGAN@NEWS-PRESS.COM

Willie Taggart wasn’t hiding Thursday. The Florida State coach wasn’t ducking any questions from any Seminoles fans.

In fact, that’s what the Seminoles Boosters 2019 Spring Tour that kicked off in Fort Myers at the IMAG museum is all about.

Facetime with loyal supporters, discussing the state of the football program, answering questions and concerns they had about a team that missed out on a bowl game for the first time in 36 years in Taggart’s first season.

Taggart characterized 2018 as a teaching moment for his staff and players, but emphasized the focus was on 2019 while speaking to local alumni.

""We've moved on. We don't live there anymore,"" Taggart said of the 5-7 2018 campaign. ""We're in 2019. This is a totally different team and we understand the issues we have and we're working to correct those things. And we've made improvement in those things.

""Again, we're not going to be able to show everyone until the season starts. But we know within ourselves that we're doing the thing that it takes to be able to be the winning team that we all want. One thing we can't do is stay on '18. We have to move forward.""

After the Dunbar High band serenaded fans with the FSU fight song, Taggart faced questions about the program head on about the program’s status as the worst Power 5 program when it comes to APR (Academic Progress Rate), discussed his recent success on the recruiting trail as well as his staff’s dominance over Florida and Miami in recruiting Lee County.

The former USF and Oregon coach described FSU as his dream job when he was hired in December 2017 following the departure of national championship-winning coach Jimbo Fisher to Texas A&M. And with that job came high expectations.

“You don’t want to be at a place where they don’t care,” said Taggart, who added the job was everything he wanted it to be.

With Fisher’s departure, there were some issues the new staff understood it had to clean up.

FSU saw its multi-year APR fall to 936 after posting a single-year APR of 922 for 2017-18. Should it drop below 930 the Seminoles could be in danger of not being eligible to participate in championships according to NCAA rules.

""We're making sure our guys are going to class and we're recruiting the right guys who want to come there for both,"" Taggart said. ""I think, more importantly, it's holding our guys accountable. Our guys had a heck of a semester in the classroom. We had 29 guys get their personal best this semester. We had over 24 guys with over a 3.0 or better. That's just with 87 guys on the team.

""I think with the APR you don't get there in one year and you don't change it in one year. But you put a plan together and you work to get it done. We've always had a plan. Academics have always been first. No matter where we were we're going to work to get it better and it will be better. I think as that gets better you'll see better play as well.""

In terms of recruiting, Taggart and his staff jumped 10 spots to No. 4 in the 247Sports composite team rankings with five recent commitments of four-star wide receiver Malachi Wideman, four-star cornerback Jalen Harrell, four-star Jaylon McCluster, three-star defensive end Josh Griffis and three-star Derek Bermudez.

""Our recruits are showing they're enjoying this too and excited about Florida State and where we're going,"" said Taggart, who couldn’t comment on any specific recruit. ""I think you're seeing young men that want to be a part of the culture, want to be a part of the vision we have and get Florida State football back to where it belongs.""

Taggart, a Bradenton native, particularly has had success recruiting the Fort Myers area, bringing a number of recruits to USF and was instrumental in helping bring Fort Myers High running back Darrian Felix to Oregon.

""These young guys down here, they love football. Football is really important to them,"" Taggart said. ""They're coached well by some good coaches. I think those are the guys you want playing the game of football, the guys that love to compete. Tough guys, not just physically but mentally as well.""

He was thrilled four-star Lehigh defensive end Quashon Fuller stuck with the Seminoles over Alabama this past National Signing Day.

""Besides he's a good football player, I think he's a great young man who loves Florida State University,"" Taggart said. ""I think it's important as we continue to build our program and built the culture the way that we want to we get really good football players who love Florida State University. He's a young man who's been committed to us for a long time. He stayed true to us. To me, those kind of guys are going to give you everything you have and make sure we play like we're supposed to.""

So, what should Seminoles fans expect of FSU this year as they open with Boise State in Jacksonville on Aug. 31?

That was the question Taggart was waiting on.

""We should expect the football team we all wanted,"" Taggart said. ""That we've all wanted for a long time and that's a winning football team. A team that's playing with passion, playing Florida State football. The thing is you're not going to see that team unless you're there. Be there, support us like we know you will. And you'll see a football team every Seminole fan will be proud of.""

Man arrested for shooting girlfriend in back in Dade City,"DADE CITY, Fla. (WFLA) - A Hernando County man is facing several charges after deputies say he shot his girlfriend in the back and claimed it was an accident.

Hernando County deputies say a 911 hang-up call came in just after 6 a.m. Wednesday. When operators called the number back, 40-year-old Ronald Crisp answered.

Deputies say Crisp told 911 operators he was cleaning his gun when he accidentally shot his girlfriend. Operators say they heard a woman scream in the background and the call disconnected. Operators attempted to get back in touch with Crisp several times. When he finally answered, operators say a woman was heard screaming in the background asking for the phone. The call was then disconnected again.

Hernando County deputies who responded to the home on Reynolds Street in Dade City say they found a woman bleeding from her lower back. The woman was treated at the scene and was then taken to a local trauma center for advanced care.

When detectives spoke with Crisp at the scene, they say the man claimed he was ""clearing"" his gun when it accidentally went off, sending a round through the wall into the living room area. Crisp told them he then heard the woman screaming that she had been shot.

Once the victim was out of surgery, she spoke with detectives and told them the shooting was not accidental. Deputies say the woman told them she and Crisp had been arguing for a few days. According to a report from the sheriff's office, the woman said Crisp had a pocketknife in his hands during the argument.

The woman claims, at some point, Crisp got a handgun. She told deputies she exchanged words with Crisp and walked out of the bedroom, closing the door behind her.

Detectives say the woman told them she ""immediately heard a shot, then felt pain in her lower back."" When she screamed for Crisp to call 911, the victim told deputies he hesitated and then told her to go get his gun cleaning kit.

During a search of the home, detectives say they found a .380 caliber handgun with an altered serial number, a hidden short-barreled rifle with no identifiable serial number and a pocketknife. Deputies noted there was no hole in the wall where Crisp claimed there would be. A bullet hole was found in the bedroom door, deputies say.

Crisp was arrested and charged with aggravated battery with a firearm, shooting a deadly missile, tampering with a witness, possession of a firearm with an altered serial number and possession of a short-barreled rifle.

A convicted sex offender arrested Sunday in the brutal killing of a 77-year-old man in Miami Beach, Florida, has confessed to six more murders during a police interview this week.

Nicholas Gibson, 32, was tracked to and later arrested in New York City while exiting a subway train after getting into a fight with officers, according to the Miami Beach Police Department. One NYPD officer was injured in the struggle, police said.

Gibson allegedly killed 77-year-old Erik Stocker in South Florida on April 20, but his body wasn't found until 10 days later when neighbors noticed a foul smell from his apartment. Authorities have not said how Stocker died, but the Miami Herald reported the man was mutilated with a sword.

The suspect was also wanted by U.S. Marshals for failing to register as a sex offender, police said.

Gibson is expected to be returned to Miami to face charges for the murder of Stocker, while Miami Beach police said he also could face charges for assaulting a New York police officer and resisting arrest.

During the course of an interview this week with Miami Beach police, who traveled to New York to speak with Gibson, the 32-year-old confessed to six more murders in Florida, Georgia and California, police said.

""In that interview, he admitted to his involvement in the murder of Mr. Stocker,"" Ernesto Rodriguez, Miami Beach Police Department public information officer, said in a release. ""We also recovered physical evidence to support the murder charges that will be filed against him once he is returned to Miami.""

Rodriguez added, ""Mr. Gibson also made additional statements about his involvement in six other murders during earlier times in his life.""

Miami Beach police said it will be ""working with law enforcement in these locations in an attempt to determine the credibility of his statements.""

Florida man says he's sorry after trying to pawn baby as prank,"Florida man says he's sorry after trying to pawn baby as prank Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Video

SARASOTA, Fla. (WFLA) - A massive manhunt ensued after a Sarasota man tried to pawn his baby. Turns out, it was a prank gone wrong and the man is now speaking out. He's very sorry for what happened.

On Tuesday evening, a man entered the A&F Pawn shop in Sarasota and made a strange request to store owner Richard Jordan.

""The weirdest, strangest situation we've ever encountered,” said Jordan. ""He put it on the counter, he was pretty serious about it. He spun the baby around, and said- can I pawn this?""

It lasted less than a minute, but after he left Jordan called the police. A few hours later, Brian Slocum realized he was all over the news. He called authorities to explain and soon dozens of officers were outside his home.

""They didn't find it funny or hilarious at all and there was a lot of resources and time and money that went into it,” said Slocum.

Slocum is a single dad with a seven month old son named Caden.

At the urging of his nephew, he started making silly videos on Snapchat. On Tuesday, Slocum recorded his latest stunt.

In the Snapchat video Slocum says: “This is what I got, I know no one under 18 in here but he's barely used, 7 ½ months old, what do you think he's worth?""

He didn't think the manager would take it seriously.

""I was thinking I'd go in there and the guy would be like, oh if it was my son, I'd give you ten grand or something,” said Slocum.

Slocum says his joke obviously fell flat.

""This is not funny! This is not funny, this is serious business,” said Jordan.

""There's nothing in the world I would trade for my son, he's my world. Nor any money is worth him,” said Slocum.

Sarasota police are not charging him, and Slocum has learned his lesson. He has a warning for others.

""It was a prank, it was skit and a lot of these young people don't realize that doing things like this has a consequence,” said Slocum.",http://www.nbc4i.com/news/u-s-world/florida-man-says-he-s-sorry-after-trying-to-pawn-baby-as-prank/1990792915,2019-05-09T00:45:34Z,WCMH,"3165 Olentangy River Rd, Columbus, OH 43202, USA"

"Weston man sentenced to 5 ½ years in prison for bank robberies, attempted carjacking","The FBI says David L. Brasher robbed a Bank of America in Fort Lauderdale.

BROWARD COUNTY, Fla. - A Weston man was sentenced Wednesday to 5 ½ years in federal prison for two bank robberies and an attempted carjacking.

David Brasher, 36, pleaded guilty on Feb. 22 to two counts of bank robbery and one count of attempted carjacking.

U.S. District Judge William P. Dimitrouleas sentenced Brasher to a total of 66 months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release. Dimitrouleas also ordered Brasher to pay a total of $18,826 in restitution.

According to prosecutors, Brasher robbed a teller at a Wells Fargo Bank in Sunrise on Oct. 30, 2018.

Prosecutors said he handed the teller a note demanding cash and stating that he had a bomb.

He also raised his shirt and displayed what the teller thought was a handgun, prosecutors said.

According to court record, Brasher fled the bank with $18,613.

Prosecutors said he robbed a Bank of American in Fort Lauderdale on Nov. 6 and once again handed a teller a note demanding cash and warning that he had a bomb.

Prosecutors said he got away with $2,815 during that robbery.

Brasher was also convicted of trying to carjack a woman and her daughter in a parking lot in Fort Lauderdale hours after the robbery at the Bank of America.

Prosecutors said he threatened her with a beer bottle and told her he would kill her if she didn't hand over her keys.

The woman screamed for help and her husband, who was a short distance away, ran over and punched Brasher in the head.

Brasher then ran away, authorities said.

"Dog recovering after Florida man drags him behind truck, deputies say","HERNANDO COUNTY, Fla. - A dog that was dragged behind behind a truck is recovering and in good spirits, but the search is still on for the man accused of abusing him.

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office on Wednesday announced that they were seeking the dog's owner, 48-year-old Gregory Tousignant, on an animal cruelty charge.

Deputies said Tousignant tied a piece of rope that was attached to the 1-year-old pit bull's collar to the back bumper of a truck then drove down Northcliffe Boulevard in Spring Hill Friday morning. The dog was eventually able to get loose from his collar.

Jan Harwood of Nature Coast Animal Wellness & Surgical Center in Weeki Wachee told WFTS that she saw the incident happen and immediately rendered aid to the dog, now named Ollie.

""It’s the most horrific thing I honestly have ever seen and I can’t get it out of my head,"" Harwood told the TV station.

The dog is now recovering at the veterinary clinic. Photos posted on the clinic's Facebook page show road-rash type injuries to Ollie's left side, including on his paws and face.

Since then, more recent updates show Ollie cuddling with clinic staff, wagging his tail and wearing the cone of shame to stop him from licking.

Despite being sore, staff said Ollie appears to be in good spirits and loves attention.

""He is tolerating his treatment without hesitation and that tail is wagging like nothing ever happened,"" the clinic posted on its Facebook page. ""What a sweet baby we have here.""

WTSP reports that Ollie will be available for treatment once his wounds heal.

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office is asking anyone with information concerning Tousignant's whereabouts to call 352-754-6830.

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - A South Florida man on business in the Tampa Bay area claims he was harassed by Starbucks employees at the company's Brandon store.



Lorne Green says he's been to that location before, usually with his white colleague, and never had any problems.



At a news conference on Wednesday, Green explained that his trip to the Starbucks at 2350 W. Brandon Blvd. went horribly wrong on April 22.



Green claims he walked in to use the bathroom before placing his order, and heard an employee say ""the big black guy is headed for the bathroom.""



As Green used the restroom, he told reporters that employees kept banging on the door asking if he needed fire and rescue.



Green called Starbucks corporate to explain what was happening, and he recorded that phone call, playing part of it for reporters Wednesday afternoon.



He said he began to fear for his life when employees said they were calling the police.



""I felt humiliated,"" Green said. ""Completely defeated. They had wronged me, and now they were going to call the cops on me?""



Hillsborough County deputies arrived and issued him a citation for trespassing, according to Green's attorney, civil rights lawyer Jasmine Rand.



He was told not to return or he would be arrested.

Florida man arrested after refusing to remove 'obscene' sticker from window,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Dillon Webb. (Columbia County Jail)

LAKE CITY, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say a Florida man was jailed after refusing to remove an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window.

A Columbia County Sheriff's Office report says 23-year-old Dillon Shane Webb was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence.

It says a deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite. The sticker said ""I eat a--,"" according to the Lake City Reporter.

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court.

Officials say the deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part but Webb refused, citing his First Amendment free speech rights. The deputy then charged Webb with resisting and took him to jail.

Webb was later released on $2,500 bond. Jail records didn't list an attorney.",https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-man-arrested-after-refusing-to-remove-obscene-sticker-from-window/1988430814,2019-05-08T10:58:04Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"
A Florida Man television series will happen this year,"Oxygen will pick up a television series based on Florida Man crime.

Florida’s most notorious will make it to Oxygen, the crime-focused cable television network, The Hollywood Reporter stated.

Since rebranding in 2017, Oxygen has created original content focusing on true crime. When it comes to Florida Man, Blumhouse TV will produce a series that focuses on “the most outrageous, notorious and craftiest killers from the Sunshine State.”

The Hollywood Reporter adds: “When a crime sounds like it came straight from a Hollywood screenplay, there's a good chance it was committed by a Florida Man.”

Oxygen’s Executive Vice President of Original Programming and Development, Rod Aissa, told the Hollywood Reporter, ""This year we’ve increased our original hours by more than 30 percent, and we'll keep ramping up our programming efforts as more fans flock to the network to experience best-in-class content.""

So, which Florida Man stories might be featured on the true crime-themed doc series? We don’t know for sure, but based on reports, the series will focus on murders and not the silly antics many love.

"Tallahassee 'water person' pursues mermaid dreams, tail and all","Buy Photo Jo Ostrov, a woman who always wanted to be a mermaid at Weeki Watchi Springs State Park, swims in the springs as a mermaid. (Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

Sometimes you have to wait for what you really want. You may not have told everyone about your dream. You might have been hesitant to reveal the depth of your fantasy. But if you’re ready when the magical opportunity comes — you’ll jump at the chance and your dreams can come true.

Especially if you want to be a mermaid.

A mermaid? OK. An unusual obsession perhaps, but where is it written that a 67-year-old grandmother, wife of a prominent retired physician, a garden designer, former beekeeper and environmentalist can’t also have fantasized about living the good life under the waves, wriggling her tail in graceful arcs and fraternizing with benevolent turtles and fish?

For one Tallahassee woman who has actually worn the flippers — nowhere is it written!

Jo Ostrov sits on the edge of a hot tub beneath a garden gazebo. Above her is a sign indicating we have entered an outdoor sanctum she calls her Mermaid Lagoon. Though not a watery lagoon per se, it is where Ostrov repairs to soak up the ambiance she has created in the little garden grotto.

Surrounded with table-sized clam shells, and smaller exotic shells from the Phillippines, Hawaii, Costa Rica, and Japan, Ostrov has adorned herself with colorful, exotic mollusk jewelry at her wrists, neck and ears. Mermaid statuary is nearby and the entire “lagoon” palette is touched with aqua… including the color of Ostrov’s nails. “I am a “water person,” she says matter-of-factly. “My husband is a land-man, but he respects my need to be near and in the water every day.”

Buy Photo Jo Ostrov, a woman who always wanted to be a mermaid at Weeki Watchi Springs State Park, in her backyard which she turned into a mermaid lagoon Friday, April 26, 2019. (Photo: Alicia Devine/Tallahassee Democrat)

And she means it. Ostrov swims at Premier Health and Fitness pool four or five times a week. Her five garden venues include small ponds, bubbling fountains, and winding streams. And she is never happier than when on the yearly vacations the couple has made to Hawaii since the '80s, Ostrov finds herself swimming in the clear, warm waters of Kauai.

Other favorite venues to interact with dolphins, turtles, and commune with whales, will find her snorkeling, scuba-diving, or body surfing beside youths a third her age. Jo Ostrov was most definitely cut out to be a mermaid. Yet it might not have been so.

“I was born in Akron,” she says. “One of nine children, we didn’t go to fancy country clubs to learn to swim, but rather to one of Ohio’s muddy lakes where a Red Cross instructor would oversee our progress. My mother, sitting on the sand, never really learned.”

In high school, Ostrov was in the school pool every day of summer, later becoming a life guard at Ohio State. She added swimming with the synchronized team and got her scuba certification before heading off for her initial experience with the “real ocean,” her first visit to Hawaii. The underwater beauty of corals and animal life, the colors, the currents touched something in Ostrov that she has yet to still. Nor would she want to.

Fast forward nearly 50 years. Along with other trends like Princesses, Unicorns and Pet Rocks, Mermaids began to have their day. Everyone from little girls, to big girls and their mothers seemed to have awakened to Ariel and the allure of the deep. Mermaid toys, blankets, jewelry, even pet outfits came to market.

Even more unusual, adult women could pop for $300 “seamless, neoprene/Silicone, swimmable tails.” And three and half hours south of Tallahassee, though marginally operational, there existed a venerable Florida attraction that for all the ways time had passed it by, knew that at least it had something the public could still get excited about. Weeki Wachee Springs State Park had Mermaids!

In 1947, Newt Perry had built the roadside “pull-‘um’in” in the crystal clear waters of Weeki Watchee Springs. Within its craggy underwater geography, he contrived a giant shoot called the “Tunnel” through which 35 mostly local girls would drop themselves into the water and emerge from under a stony shelf to frolic and wave at visitors behind giant plate glass windows, awing Midwestern holiday crowds at seeing “real mermaids” cavorting in the deep. And then Disney Inc. brought the whole operation to a near sputtering stop.

Yet despite the competition to the south and the mermaid vogue’s slow wane, Weeki Wachee has carried on — and parlayed a certain nostalgia into good business. Today Junior Mermaid camps and Sirens of the Deep camps, for those over 30, are $450 Sold Out affairs. From April to October, two-day “camps” are organized by former Weeki Wachee mermaids who mentor and coach those whose fantasies might have only grown over the years. Jo Ostrov, one of eight in each class, says the oldest woman in her camp group was 80.

“It was wonderful,” enthuses Ostrov. “I had practiced my dolphin kicks in the pool for a month before I went so my stomach muscles were ready! The hardest part really, was getting into the mermaid tail and hopping backwards on the deck to get into the water.” But once in, she says she found her joy. With clear spring water rushing from beneath the earth from a vent the size of a car, the water is 72 degrees.

“It feels wonderful when you first enter, but for every 45 minutes you spend in the water, you loose three degrees of body temperature,” said Ostrov. The amateur mermaids, all in their confining tails, spent four such sessions in the water each day practicing their “underwater pinwheels, backward dolphins, and flower swimming.”

Ostrov says that though campers don’t learn to use the long oxygen tubes reserved for the professional mermaids who are putting on shows right beside the campers, they did master keeping their eyes open for long periods, wearing a constant beatific smile, and slowly letting air out of their mouths so as not to pop to the surface in an unmermaid-like eruption.

“It was so definitely a delight,” says Jo Ostrov, who in the future yearns to take a granddaughter or two back to Weeki Watchee to wiggle into a tail. “Swimming with the ancient white flounders that live at the bottom of the springs, being shadowed by the huge turtles who seem to love to spend time with the “mermaids” was wonderful.”

And for Jo Ostrov, committed water person, it seems a basic bucket-list item has been checked off. One can perhaps even hear her humming the signature song of the mermaids of Weeki Wachee, a tongue-in-cheek, but very heart-felt, “I’ve Got the World by the Tail… sittin’ on a rainbow…” And in her case, it would very definitely be true.

"Treat Muscovy ducks with respect, not mistreatment: your say","0511 CARTOON (Photo: Doug MacGregor)

Duck decorum

The News-Press has published stories concerning the Muscovy duck and its designation as an “invasive pest”. The stories don't mention that these ducks are very gentle, trusting, and intelligent animals.

The Florida Wildlife Conservation Commission decided in 2010, that these ducks are a non-native, invasive species ignoring evidence that they have been in the area for hundreds of years. They eat bugs, plants, roaches, mosquitoes, all kind of creatures we really don't want. Their main offense is they are messy.

If we, as a society, start killing living things because they are messy, we are in trouble. The News-Press article gave the idea that it is acceptable to kill these gentle ducks with pellet guns. The ducks scare easily by yelling at the or using a water gun.

In a day where in our society mass murders seem to be frequent, maybe the idea that shooting these ducks is way off base. A culture can be judged by how it treats living animals. If you don't want them around, don't feed them, spray them with water to scare them, and yell at them. They are pretty smart and will get the idea quickly that you don't want them around.

Missed opportunity

My wife and I just came back from our first Lee-Collier County Honor Flight. I was a guardian for a five-tour Vietnam veteran. Spent the day in Washington, D.C., at all the memorials then came home to RSW to a true heroes welcome.

Between two thousand and three thousand men, women, children, infants, including other veterans in uniform greeted them with cheering, hugging and kissing our veterans, giving them candy and home made letters from the kids.



Finally, they were properly thanked for their sacrifice for all of us. The only thing missing was the media. No TV cameras etc. Is it only death and blood and guts violence that sells?



Missed opportunity for our community to share a very special moment.

In politics, as in life, priorities matter. The 2017 tax law, which heavily favored large corporations and the wealthy, is a perfect example of putting the wrong things first.

But the new Working Families Tax Relief Act does it right. It would significantly boost income for working families by expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, and give families an additional tax credit for raising young children. That's more money for basic necessities, home repairs, maintaining a car to get to work, and in some cases, education to get a higher-paying job. This bill would benefit 44 million families and lift 11 million children above the poverty line.

Priorities matter. It's time we fixed our tax laws to give working people and children a fair shot to get ahead. Congress should make expanding the EITC and CTC a priority in any upcoming tax legislation.

Truth test

We are a politically divided electorate, but one thing we ought to agree on is that the President of the United States should not be a serial liar. Yes, presidents lie; there are abundant examples, but Trump’s predecessors lied selectively, lied to cover up personal indiscretions or bad policy; they didn’t lie frequently and gratuitously.

When Eisenhower lied about U-2 flights over Russia, he lied to prevent covert CIA missions from becoming public. When Lyndon Johnson lied about military operations in the Gulf of Tonkin, he was trying to advance his war agenda in Vietnam. When Bill Clinton lied about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, he was trying to save his family and himself from embarrassment.

The Washington Post reports that, as president, Trump has told over 10,000 lies, averaging about two dozen a day. Unlike his predecessors, Trump latches onto conspiracy theories and lunatic fringe nonsense and presents the ideas to the American people as truth. Among his many lies at the Saturday rally in Wisconsin, Trump offered the vile assertion that Democrats support infanticide.

Maybe the difference between Trump and other presidents is that they knew they were lying; Trump, on the other hand, probably believes the falsehoods he spews. But is this the person we want as president, someone who doesn't know the difference between a lie and the truth, and doesn't care?

There's hope

Regarding the News from the North item from Virginia in The News-Press on April 29:

Let's get this straight. A former presidential statue park went belly up. So an individual moved them to a private park where there is a small fee for visitation. A visitor walked off with a bust of Obama. Why?

When word got out that the bust had been stolen an individual came forward and said he had it. The thief wanted to return it. He was praised for his honesty (wow).

Quote: There is hope for people in this country. It is amazing that the thief actually returned the object.

Facts first

I have been thinking about this for the past few weeks. Several people have written to the Mailbag with opinions of what is and is not stated in the Muller report. In most cases views expressed were repeats of the political rhetoric from one side or the other.

When Muller was appointed both sides of the aisle proclaimed he was the right person for this assignment.

Before anyone offers their opinions of what is in the report or what if any followup action should be taken or not taken – I urge them to actually spend the time to read it. It is available on line and although dry reading it details what was investigated, what criteria was used to determine the impact of actions, what the impacts were. It is well written and detailed.

We should all be basing our opinions on facts and not just repeating others views. Spend the time to do your own investigation before trying to influence others and support your view with data not rhetoric of others.

By the way, I just finished reading all 448 pages.

Very unfair

Am I the only one who finds it jarring when a grown man uses the expression very unfair? That expression is something a 5-year-old uses when his sister got a bigger slice of cake. It sounds odd every time it is used by a candidate, let alone officeholders in our country.



It’s very unfair that hundreds of thousands of us survivors are repeatedly re-victimized every time we hear his voice after having heard him brag about how women “let him” sexually assault them. No, that’s not very unfair, it’s heartbreaking.



It’s very unfair that thousands of parents, siblings, children and others cry themselves to sleep every night because their loved ones were murdered on this presidents’ watch. No, that’s not very unfair, it’s contemptible. Its very unfair that people who come to America seeking sanctuary from violence are incarcerated, likely split from their family, and sleeping tonight on cold concrete with a foil blanket. No that’s not “very unfair.”. That’s despicable.



I have some news for you, Mr. President, and I am kind of surprised that you don’t already know this. Life is unfair. And America is not 5 years old.



Jennifer Smith, Fort Myers

Ominous threat

A recent letter offered assurances about the continued existence of the Electoral College. I share the writer’s support for the electoral process, but have some concerns.

The mostly Democrat opposition to the electoral process is making progress. The most prominent movement is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC). This initiative intends to guarantee the candidate winning the national popular vote is elected. NPVIC must get states to enact legislation whereby states pledge all their electors to the national popular vote winner. They need to sign on enough states to theoretically control 270 (50% plus one) of the 538 electors. They have 189 electors so far from approval by a mere 14 states. That’s threatening progress.

The Constitution seems to prohibit interstate agreements such as NPVIC unless Congress consents, but legal scholars aren’t in agreement about that. In order to eliminate the Electoral College by Constitutional Amendment, it would require three-fourths of the states, or 38. So NPVIC does seem easier.

Destruction of the Electoral College isn’t likely, but it does face an ominous threat. We must resist these efforts in order to preserve this “linchpin” of our “representative republic” form of government.

Drug dilemma

We understand that a large percentage of generic drugs are manufactured in Turkey and India. Are these prescription drugs going to be outlawed if this imported drug bill is passed?

My wife takes three different inhalers for her COPD. Even with insurance they are too expensive for us to buy in the U.S. However, we can get (namebrand inhalers) through mail order that originate in the UK, but are probably manufactured elsewhere, at almost half the price of the same brand in the U.S.

Is this new bill going to take these opportunities away from us? I would bet that it is the big pharmaceuticals that are promoting this movement.

Taxpayer folly

As I write these words, the Florida State budget is now on its way to the governor’s desk for signature. Inevitably, the crowing about “who-got-what” will start to pop up on editorial pages all across Florida. Politicians will brag to their constituents about how they brought home the bacon. Lobbyists will be hugged by their employers.

And the taxpayers will foot the bill.

This is as good a time as any to remember that the State budget is NOT a giant pinata, with goodies cascading down on the participants as the prodding ends. It is supposed to do the absolute necessary, and nothing more.

We have strayed badly from our original founding principles of limited government, individual initiative, and personal responsibility.

Next time, vote Libertarian. Thank you.

Good example

Thank you for the excellent article today about teen mental health and the mental health system. The article highlighted the scandalous and dangerous lack of mental health providers, facilities and resources in this area. We must be advocates for people that cannot advocate for themselves.

I would hope that readers would start demanding that our political leaders address funding for resources and treatment, and improve access to mental health professionals. Journalists are a pillar in maintaining our democracy, and this article was a good example of education and advocacy that we sorely need.

Undermining future

Thank you for bringing attention to the extreme shortage of mental health services for children and adolescents in our area. As a social worker who specialized in children's services in Fort Myers prior to my retirement, I saw firsthand the devastation experienced by children and youth, as well as their siblings, parents, and the larger community, because there were no services available locally.

Families, no matter how motivated, can only do so much. Public schools, already stressed by inadequate resources, cannot cope with the unmet psychiatric needs of students and the education of other pupils is compromised. When we don't provide timely access to required care, we undermine our own future.

Amy Palmer Henry, Fort Myers

Sour deal

Why are we continuing to subsidize the sugar industry to the tune of $3 billion-$4 billion a year?

We consumers spend twice the amount for sugar as the rest of the world because of these subsidies. In return for this sweet deal, they send us polluted, nutrient laden water. This is insanity.

Drop the subsidies and trade protection thus letting free market forces fall where they may and import sugar. You do not need WaterTask Force for this, you need an economist.

This is nothing more than corporate welfare. My guess is until the state suffers greater than $3 billion-$4 billion in economic losses because of this insane policy, nothing will change.

Mom of Maleah Davis makes shocking allegations against ex-fiance,"- Four-year-old Maleah Davis has been missing for a week and now community activist Quanell X is speaking out with Maleah's mom, Brittany Bowens.

At a press conference Friday, they threw several allegations at Darion Vence, Maleah's stepfather and Bowen's ex-fiance.

Vence, who is a person of interest in Maleah's disappearance, told police that he, Maleah and his 1-year-old son were abducted by three men. Vence and the boy were released, but Maleah remains missing.

Quanell X and Bowens allege that they have security footage from a neighboring apartment that shows Vence walking in and out of their apartment with multiple bottles of bleach. Later, he's said to be seen walking out with a garbage bag stuffed into a laundy hamper.

Bowens said that he told her he was cleaning the apartment. This would have been during the time that Bowens was out of town.

The footage is said to be in the hands of law enforcment to aid in their investigation.

Quanell also claims Vence had a history of violence against Maleah, that included spankings and beatings.

Bowens thinks Vence may have snapped because they got into a fight after she says she caught him sending explicit pictures to another man. She confronted him about being gay and then broke things off with him.

This comes just a day after police discovered the car that was stolen from the family in a Missouri City parking lot.

Little Maleah has been missing for a week.

NASA is using the same spacesuits astronauts wore 30 years ago. Experts say that needs to change.,"When astronauts Story Musgrave and Donald Peterson conducted the space shuttle program’s first spacewalk in 1983, they probably wouldn’t have imagined their spacesuits would still be in use on the International Space Station some 36 years later.

Not only are they still in use but the suits, intended to last 15 years, are currently the only ones available for astronauts whizzing around Earth at thousands of miles per hour.

Now, as NASA prepares to head back to the moon, the agency must scramble to develop a next-generation suit or the next American astronauts will be forced to don some hand-me-down, 1980s equipment.

Sure, the suits get updated after six years in orbit or 25 spacewalks, but with outdated technology and only a limited quantity available, the fact of the matter is the nearly 40-year-old suits NASA employs will not serve the needs of future moonwalkers.

The current spacesuits are expected to last until 2028 – four years after NASA hopes to land astronauts on the moon again.But a series of incidents and issues from the spacesuits suggests the need for change is more urgent. A recent example is the all-female spacewalk cancellation in March, which instead had a male and female astronaut perform the walk.

NASA has known for a while that it needs to update its spacesuits. The agency's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel reiterated the urgency to develop the next-generation suit during a meeting last month.

In 2017, a similar report by NASA's inspector general came to the same conclusion and stated ""the agency remains years away from having a flight-ready spacesuit capable of replacing the EMU or suitable for use on future exploration missions.""

EMUs, or Extravehicular Mobility Units, are the current suits used on the ISS.

Considered to be a “mini spacecraft” in itself, the spacesuit astronauts currently wear to survive the harsh environment of space is complex and requires major modifications based on the user.

""The EMU, of course, is very bulky. It's a big, bulky, awkward suit to work in,"" former NASA astronaut Winston Scott told FLORIDA TODAY. ""But your life depends on it. It is a totally self-contained life support system.""

Since the retirement of the shuttle program in 2011, ""NASA has had limited ability to return the EMUs from the ISS because only one of the commercial vehicles that ferry supplies to the station has the capability to return items to Earth,"" according to the inspector general's report.

""As a result, astronauts are using the EMUs for much longer periods of time between maintenance and refurbishment than originally intended,"" the report reads.

And only 11 of the 18 ""EMU Primary Life Support System units,"" backpack-like structures required to keep astronauts alive when conducting spacewalks, are still in use. Five were destroyed in the Challenger and Columbia disasters as well as the SpaceX cargo mission that broke apart in 2015. Another was lost during ground testing and the last was built for certification only and is not suitable for flight.

NASA has had years to develop a next-generation spacesuit, but a ""lack of a formal plan and specific destinations for future missions has complicated spacesuit development,"" the report noted.

Starting in 2005 with the establishment of the Constellation program, which called for the development of a suite of vehicles to take astronauts back to the moon and beyond, NASA has spent almost $200 million on three spacesuit development efforts.

On May 1, NASA said on Twitter there would be a ""transition suit"" for the first mission to return to the moon that would include modern designs for astronauts to explore the lunar surface. As to what those advancements will be or what the transition suit will entail, the agency is still unsure.

""We’re looking at internal and external options for a transition spacesuit for the Moon 2024 landing with American astronauts as well as options for modern spacesuits for sustainable surface missions,"" NASA spokeswoman Cheryl Warner said.

Possible future spacesuits

On the local front, Florida Institute of Technology academics have their own ideas on how to upgrade NASA's spacesuits.

In 2016, Ondrej Doule, director and founder of the university's Human Spaceflight Laboratory, along with students and team members, won the grand prize for their design of the interior of a single-person spacecraft in the Genesis Engineering Solutions competition.

The ""Wholly Human Integrated Single Person Spacecraft"" could replace the current spacesuits, Doule said. Instead of modeling the single-person spacecraft to look like a suit, the device would essentially become a mini-spacecraft with robotic arms and would have enough room for one astronaut.

Not only could any astronaut perform spacewalks regardless of their body shape, the walks would also be safer to perform because the robotic arms, operated by the astronauts, would do all the repairs needed outside of the space station instead of actual people, Doule said.

Though NASA does not know what the next spacesuit will look like, the agency is casting a wide net in its search.

As part of the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program, the agency is funding 18 studies, one of which includes the development of a ""SmartSuit,"" an intelligent suit designed with self-healing skin and data collection for spacewalks in extreme environments, NASA said last month.

The SmartSuit could be used to travel to other celestial bodies like the moon and Mars, and will incorporate ""soft-robotics technology that allows astronauts to be highly mobile and better interact with their surroundings,"" according to the release.

The $125,000 project, however, is only in the first phase and can only receive additional funding after successful studies and a transition to the second phase.

Scott, who conducted three spacewalks in NASA's current spacesuit, has his own wishes for how future suits should operate.

""An ideal spacesuit would be one that you don't even think about while you're wearing it,"" Scott said. ""So that means the suit would be light. It would fit you, it wouldn't be big and bulky.""

Instead of inhibiting movement, vision or restricting the astronaut in any way, Scott hopes for a much lighter, tighter-fit suit that still protects the astronaut. He also wouldn't mind an ""Iron Man"" version of a spacesuit.

""Perhaps the suit will be smaller and lighter than what we have, but maybe with some human assist functions like some robotics inside the suit to help you move,"" Scott said. ""Like the suits we develop for our military, the super soldier suits. Like the real version of Iron Man.""

Current suits won't work for deep space missions

With the race back on to send humans to the moon again by 2024, why won't the current spacesuits work if they've already been approved to last until 2028?

According to the inspector general's report, spacesuit requirements vary for each mission. A spacesuit designed for the moon has different needs than one for Mars since ""each destination has different temperatures, radiation levels, pressures, mobility requirements, and exposure to dust and debris.""

Though the current spacesuits are sufficient for use aboard the space station, it won't suffice for deep space exploration missions.

""For example, the current EMU lacks the hip and flexibility needed to walk on and explore planetary surfaces,"" the report reads.

Typically, spacesuits are designed with the mission in mind.

Custom-fit suits were made specifically for astronauts of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions. But with the shuttle program, NASA took a different approach.

As the astronaut class grew larger, it became too expensive to custom-tailor each suit to each astronaut. Instead, NASA’s current suits are a combination of several detachable parts that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.

This allows multiple astronauts to wear the same suit, something the agency has done since the 1980s. But that's not to say they haven't come with their own sets of issues.

Past incidents and current issues

CLOSE Astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch were to make landmark history, but NASA canceled it keeping their safety in mind before anything else. USA TODAY

In March, NASA was planning the first all-female spacewalk with astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch. But a lack of readily available spacesuits aboard the space station prevented a historic event from occurring.

With limited sizes available, sometimes astronauts — usually females — cannot perform spacewalks due to sizing issues with available spacesuits, NASA design engineer Elizabeth Benson said in a 2009 paper named ""Complexity of Sizing for Space Suit Applications.""

This was essentially the problem with the planned all-female spacewalk – both McClain and Koch required mediums, but there was only one on board that would be ready in time, NASA spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz said. The spacewalk did happen, just not with two female astronauts. Instead, NASA astronaut Nick Hague took over McClain's spot and accompanied Koch on the walk.

A simple solution would have been making more sizes available, but due to high costs, NASA had to downgrade the options to only medium, large and extra large sizes, preventing smaller astronauts from wearing the suits and conducting spacewalks.

And if limited sizing and quantity weren't already issues, according to NASA, a spacesuit weighs approximately 280 pounds on the ground. In space, it may not weigh anything, but that still doesn't mean astronauts aren't carrying around all that mass, Scott said.

""Its bulk makes it difficult to work in and some of the smaller stature people or some of the weaker physical people can't manipulate the suit,"" Scott said. ""And of course, they may or may not be able to conduct a spacewalk.""

Kathryn Sullivan, the first American woman to perform a spacewalk in 1985, had her own issues with the suit. In an interview with Outside Magazine in April, Sullivan explained how the suit never fit her correctly.

""The suit's knee was a bit above mine,"" she told the magazine. ""Every time I needed to bend, I wasn't bending a natural joint.""

Astronaut Linda Godwin also told the magazine the shoulders of the spacesuit were the biggest issue.

The suits were initially designed to fit a wide variety of both women and men, but that changed after the agency cut back in sizes.

Astronaut Peggy Whitson, who holds the American record for time spent in space, said in a documentary interview: ""As a woman, doing spacewalks is more challenging, mostly because the suits are sized bigger than the average female.""

So why is this a big deal?

As men and women of different shapes and sizes join NASA's astronaut corps, a poorly fitted suit not only prevents certain astronauts from conducting spacewalks, but ""can also increase the effort that a wearer must exert to move in the suit, since their joints are not lined up with the suit joints,"" Benson said.

""Also, a poorly fit suit has the potential to actually impinge on the wearer during motion and lead to a reduction in mobility and risk of injury,"" she said.

In space, astronauts are essentially floating within their pressurized spacesuit, Scott said. Because the suit is pressurized, which basically means the suit is inflated like a balloon, a common problem astronauts find when wearing the suit is the ability to bend their joints.

""Imagine you're trying to reach for a tool in space and you're reaching to wrap your fingers around the tool. When you try to close and open your fingers, your suit is working against you because it's pressurized,"" Scott said.

In fact, since they were designed in the 1970s, there have been more than 3,400 anomalies with the current spacesuits, according to the inspector general's report. They range from a loose boot thread to glove damage, uncomfortable body temperatures and helmet water intrusions.

Such was the case in 2013 when European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano reported water, a little over a third of a gallon, in his helmet while conducting a spacewalk. A similar instance occurred again in 2016 with NASA astronaut Timothy Kopra. Both spacewalks were terminated early.

None of the incidents that occurred during spacewalks have resulted in deaths or serious injuries, and only five were terminated early. But that's not to say a new spacesuit isn't necessary for future space exploration.

""As we go forward in space, we need to figure out ways to build suits that provide the protection that you need,"" Scott said. ""But also that are lighter and more flexible and better able to allow a person to work in them.""

Now and Then: Leesburg's Getzel's had Holocaust survivor history,"LEESBURG — When Getzel’s Department Store in downtown Leesburg closed its doors in February, it was the end of an era.

Getzel Mularsky, a Holocaust survivor, moved to Florida in 1949 with the family of his wife’s uncle, which raised her. The move not only led to a business career of more than 50 years, it led to a religious vocation as well.

His wife’s uncle, Max Idelson, wanted to do something for Mularsky since he agreed to follow the family south, so Idelson bought a business for him to run.

Leesburg was a very busy town then. Wolf’s clothing store for men was for sale and Mularsky’s father-in-law bought it.

It opened Feb. 1, 1950 and was named Idelson's Dry Goods Store until 1959, when the uncle died. It was then renamed Getzel's Department Store.

But that wasn’t the only business Getzel Mularsky was in. The Lithuanian-born man soon entered God’s business and became a rabbi.

There were only 10 Jewish families in town in 1949 and they took turns holding services on Friday evenings at the homes of the different members.

""When I came here, they found out I could read Hebrew, and the people, they drafted me. That's how I got started as a rabbi,"" Mularsky said in an interview more than 15 years ago. ""I went to seminary in Baltimore. But most of my training was in the old country. In the old country, they start training when you are 5 or 6 years old. You go to Hebrew school.""

He was a teenager living in Lithuania when his family was sent to Concentration Camp Dacha.

Three years later, he was the only family member who left after the camp was liberated.

""I lost my father, my mother and my older sister;"" he said. ""They all perished. I'm the only survivor from my family.""

Mularsky came to the United States in 1947 and stayed with an uncle in Baltimore. His short stay in Baltimore led to his 50-plus-year marriage, his long career as a clothier and his spiritual vocation.

After they were married, they moved to Florida with Betty's father. Her family had lived in Florida, between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach. And her father had property there.

There had been some problem with the real estate office that was taking care of the rental property and Mularsky's father-in-law felt he needed to be close so he wouldn't lose the property.

While there, they visited an uncle in Leesburg and liked what they found. A few months later Mularsky's father-in-law opened up a department store in the old Larsen's Men Store.

In 1953, the fledgling congregation raised $4,000 and borrowed another $4,000 from First National Bank. They built their synagogue for $8,000. And they continue to meet there.

He remained the rabbi for more than 50 years. Mularsky died Dec. 22, 2004.

Pinellas County deputies conducting death investigation in Seminole,"SEMINOLE, Fla. (WFLA) – Pinellas County deputies are conducting a death investigation Thursday night.

According to the sheriff’s office, deputies responded to a call to assist fire crews around 5:30 p.m. at Oakhurst Road and 82nd Avenue North in Seminole.

The deceased is an adult man.

The investigation is still in a very preliminary stage and no further information was released.

Video shows K-9 chomping on grand theft suspect's leg after pursuit,"MARION COUNTY, Fla. - Video released from the Marion County Sheriff's Office on Thursday shows a K-9 chomping down on a grand theft suspect's calf then violently shaking its head back and forth as the man cries out in pain.

Deputies said the bite came after Daniel Eugene Bolden fled from a traffic stop in a stolen Ford F-150 on April 30.

Dashcam video shows deputies speeding after Bolden on Northwest 100th Street, chasing the suspect for about seven minutes before using stop sticks to puncture three of his tires, forcing him to pull over.

Deputies said they yelled for Bolden to surrender or else they would release K-9 Duder, but video shows Bolden hopping over a fence he crashed into and running to a wooded area.

About two minutes later, Duder caught up with the suspect.

""Get the dog off me, ahh,"" Bolden yelled while his leg was clenched between Duder's teeth, according to the video.

Deputies were able to get the K-9 to release its grip shortly thereafter.

""Moral of the story: Don’t run…Air-One will find you and the K-9s will catch you,"" the Marion County Sheriff's Office wrote in a Facebook post.

Bolden is facing charges of fleeing and eluding, resisting an officer without violence, criminal mischief, burglary, grand theft auto and petit theft.

UCF's Milton: 'I'll be playing at a high level again',"- University of Central Florida senior quarterback, McKenzie Milton, is back home in Hawaii for the first time since his leg injury. His rehabilitation started in Florida, and he says he is progressing nicely.

""I felt great, man. It's been a long time coming. Slow, grueling process, but I look at it just knocking it down, block by block, and just taking it one step at a time, literally,"" he said.

Milton says he is as far along as anyone would expect in the recovery process, adding that he doesn't like to stay too comfortable with the status quo.

""I thinking, being an athlete, you have to put yourself in uncomfortable situations and relish in those,"" he says. ""I'm working to get better every day. If it hurts, it's just pain leaving the body, so I'm working my butt off to get back on the field.""

When asked if the rehab has been as painful, if not more painful, than the actual injury, Milton says emphatically, ""one hundred percent"" yes.

""When they're ranking on the leg trying to get range of motion back it's much more painful than the initial injury, but...it's a good pain, because you know you're getting better.""



Milton wants to return to the field as soon as possible, but mostly wants to be functional and healthy at the end of the day.

""Obviously, I want to play football again, but I want to be able to run around one day when I have kids and play in the passes, play soccer....but I still dream about playing football again, and I'm confident I'll get there. I'll be playing at a high level again.""

We all hope so too.

Man Charged in Chelmsford Home Invasion,"Police in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, are investigating an armed home invasion at an apartment building.

The incident happened around 10:45 a.m. Thursday morning on Tyngsborough Road. Police say the victim and suspect didn't know each other.

When police arrived, they spotted the suspect, 45-year-old Cedric Edwards of Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, running from the scene.

Authorities say he forced his way into the apartment and assaulted the male victim at gunpoint, strangling him.

Police do not knows why Edwards came to Chelmsford from Dorchester, but neighbors say he may have been disguised.

Luis Tavares ran to help from a nearby apartment.

""I said, 'What's going on?' He said, 'This guy with a UPS jacket and hat and box in his hand ran this way,'"" Tavares recalled.

Police were able to chase Edwards down and catch him on Tyngsborough Road. They say A K-9 found a gun ditched in some nearby brush, along with Edwards' clothing and zip ties.

Edwards is now facing multiple charges, including armed home invasion and armed assault in a dwelling and strangulation.

A woman who answered the door at the alleged victim's apartment had no comment.

Girl's father confronts ice cream truck driver. What happens next?,"JACKSONVILLE BEACH, Fla. - An ice cream truck driver was arrested Tuesday evening after Jacksonville Beach police said he pushed a girl's father, resisted arrest and had marijuana in his ice cream truck.

According to police, the driver of the ice cream truck, 43-year-old Murat Tastan, was trying to get a girl to come to his vehicle near Seawalk Pavilion.

The 13-year-old girl’s father, who wished to remain anonymous, told News4Jax that she was there with other girls, participating in a gymnastics class, and he was sitting up against a tree nearby when it happened.

""At one point, I heard him play something over his microphone that said, 'Hey, baby.' It was in a baby's voice -- very creepy -- and then he whistled, so my daughter says, 'Hey, Dad. I’m a little bit worried,'"" he said.

The father told police that when he told Tastan to leave, the ice cream truck driver jumped out of his vehicle and aggressively approached him. He said Tastan bumped into his chest, knocking him backward, and cursed at him.

Police said that, when the first officer arrived, the officer saw Tastan try to go after the father again. When the officer tried to calm Tastan down, he resisted, according to an arrest report.

""It took that officer a few minutes. He requested backup because the guy was fighting with him. Another officer came. Then another officer came,"" the girl's father said. ""They finally got him to roll over and comply.""

Cellphone video shows the struggle between the ice cream truck driver and the officers as he continued to yell and move as police tried to handcuff him. Officers said they finally got Tastan to cooperate and placed him in handcuffs.

Tastan was arrested on charges of battery, resisting arrest without violence and possession of marijuana. Police said 2.2 grams of the drug were found inside the ice cream truck.

According to police, a special license is needed to operate an ice cream truck in Jacksonville Beach and Tastan hadn’t renewed his license since 2011.

Fernando Sola, another ice cream truck driver in the area, said not only do ice cream truck drivers need to be licensed, but they need to have a good attitude for the job.

""Police stop me all the time, even if they know me already, but they want to make sure every year that I have the license for Jacksonville Beach and I have all the papers. I have the insurance,"" Sola said. ""If you can’t be good with kids and you can’t be friendly with people, then you have to do something else.""

The 13-year-old’s father, as well as another man who witnessed Tuesday's incident, said they both were already concerned about Tastan, as they had each had other run-ins with him in the past. They said they hope Tastan's arrest will keep him away from the area.

The father said he is relieved he was there when the incident happened, so he could protect his daughter. But he added she's still shaken up.

Tastan, of Jacksonville, was released from the Duval County jail Wednesday on $4,500 bond, online jail records show. He is scheduled to be in court for arraignment at 9:30 a.m. May 22.

On Thursday, News4Jax went by to the address listed on the report for Tastan and a man said he had kicked Tastan out over a year ago because he wasn’t paying rent and that he is likely living out of his truck, which was impounded Tuesday evening.

A closer look at the animal perched atop an electrical pole on Alligator Alley in Collier County confirms that it was a bobcat, and not a Florida panther.

Live traffic camera video footage from the Florida Department of Transportation showed the feline near mile marker 78 on eastbound I-75. The bobcat could be seen sitting atop the pole, scanning the area in.

A utility worker attempted to nudge the bobcat to move it down the pole. Eventually, the bobcat crawled down the pole and ran into the brush.

Florida Wildlife Commission officers are on the scene.

Starbucks' history of racial harassment makes its way to Hillsborough County,"MORE ABOUT THE LAWSUIT Man claims he was harassed by Starbucks employees in Brandon

TAMPA, Fla. - A South Florida man is claiming he was the subject of racially-driven harassment at a Brandon Starbucks but it's not the first time the coffee giant has been in hot water.

Last year, two African-American men were arrested for tresspassing while waiting for a friend at a Starbucks in downtown Philadelphia, after an employee refused to allow him to use the restroom, saying it was for paying customers only.

Days later, another viral video surfaced showing an African-American man in the Los Angeles area trying to show that he was denied use of a Starbucks restroom while a white customer was allowed access.

The series of incidents prompted Starbucks to show its 175,000 employees a film about racial bias to lead into a full curriculum on the topic.

In May of 2018, more than 8,000 Starbucks locations, including more than 20 in Hillsborough County, closed for training on the subject of racial bias.

Starbucks later update it's policies, saying anyone could sit in its cafes or use its restrooms, even if they didn't buy anything.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Florida law protects anyone from discrimination based on virtually any personal factors:

""All persons are entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, handicap, familial status, or religion.""

While most lawsuits pertaining to race discrimination stem from employment or racial bias in the workplace, Florida has had seven major lawsuits involving racial discrimnation in the laws ten years ranging from everything to stop-and-frisk situations in Miami to violating the rights of minority voters.

Registered sex offender accused of publicly masturbating at UCF's campus,"Malik Gaither seen in a surveillance photo and in a mug shot, according to UCF police.

ORLANDO, Fla. - A registered sex offender is accused of publicly masturbating in front of students at the University of Central Florida on Tuesday, according to authorities.

The UCF Police Department said a woman reported that she was getting into her car, which was parked in a lot near Garage I, when she noticed a man, later identified as Malik Gaither, touching himself inappropriately while looking in her direction.

Police said they searched the campus and noticed a man who matched the description provided by the witness. Gaither, 25, abandoned a backpack and began walking faster when he noticed an officer approaching him, according to the report.

While investigating, police said they found surveillance video that showed Gaither masturbating near a woman who was on the phone and appeared to be unaware outside Trevor Colbourn Hall.

The backpack in Gaither's possession had been reported stolen by a student, according to the affidavit. It contained a laptop, headphones, $300 cash and a plane ticket with the victim's name on it, authorities said.

Police said Gaither has no ties to the university. He was trespassed from campus and arrested on charges of exposure of sexual organs, grand theft and loitering/prowling.

Records from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement show Gaither was adjudicated on a sexual battery charge in 2007, when he was a juvenile.

Deputies seek man who allegedly dragged a dog behind his truck,"- Deputies are searching for a Florida man who dragged a dog behind his truck.

Over the weekend, a pit bull was found covered in scrapes and cuts after being dragged by a truck down Northcliffe Boulevard in Spring Hill. While being dragged, the dog came loose and flew into the median.

Thankfully, Oliver was found and brought to Nature Coast Animal Wellness & Surgical Center for treatment. He is now healing and is expected to make a full recovery. He will be put up for adoption once healthy.

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office says that although a suspect was not immediately identified, deputies have now identified Oliver's owner as 58-year-old Gregory Tousignant.

Witnesses reportedly said that it appeared that Tousignant was unaware that Oliver jumped out of the bed of his truck. However, it is illegal to carry any pet in the bed of a truck that is not properly secured and prevented from jumping out of the moving vehicle.

An arrest warrant has been issued for Tousignant on a misdemeanor charge of Cruelty to Animals, which carries a $1,000 bond.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact the Hernando County Sheriff's Office at 352-754-6830.

Sex offender in 'unusually gory' murder of elderly Florida man is nabbed in NYC: police,"A convicted sex offender wanted in the grisly murder of a Florida man was arrested in New York City this week after a reported struggle with city police officers.

Nicholas Brent Gibson, 32, was wanted in the April murder of 77-year-old Erik Stocker, according to the Miami Herald. Stocker’s body was reportedly in the elderly man's home for 10 days before neighbors called authorities about an odor coming from inside the building. A source told the newspaper police found an “unusually gory” scene and it appeared the elderly man was killed by a sword of some kind.

FLORIDA WOMAN PULLS ALLIGATOR FROM HER PANTS DURING TRAFFIC STOP

Miami Beach police identified Gibson, who was the victim’s caretaker, as a suspect and also learned he was wanted by U.S. Marshals for failing to register as a sex offender in an Illinois case that goes back nearly two decades, the Miami Herald reported.

Police in Florida notified the NYPD on Friday that Gibson had traveled to New York City.

Gibson was spotted Sunday morning on an L train platform by transit officers and when the officers tried to take him into custody he became combative, the New York Post reported, citing a law enforcement source.

Once he was in custody, Gibson was charged with resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration and being a fugitive in another state, police said.

Pete Buttigieg says Donald Trump's white 'identity politics' creating a 'crisis of belonging',"CLOSE Pete Buttigieg, a two-term mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is now running for president at the age of 37. Here's what we know about the man and his campaign. Dwight Adams, dwight.adams@indystar.com

Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg accused President Donald Trump of dividing America and creating a ""crisis of belonging"" for people of color, immigrants, gay people and others.

While Trump's proposed border wall is a fantasy, the South Bend, Ind. mayor said, the administration is erecting real walls with what he called the most divisive form of ""identity politics"" – white identity politics.

That can leave black women, immigrants, the disabled, displaced auto workers and others feeling like they're living in a different country, Buttigieg told a gala of gay rights activists.

Buttigieg, who is openly gay, said there is also some schismatic thinking in the Democratic Party, such as when ""we're told we need to choose between supporting an auto worker and supporting a trans women of color, without stopping to think about the fact that sometimes the auto worker is a trans woman of color and she definitely needs all the support that she can get.""

Buttigieg said at the Human Rights Campaign gala in Las Vegas that each person has a story that can be used to either separate – or connect – them to others.

""What every gay person has in common with every excluded person of any kind is knowing what it’s like to see a wall between you and the rest of the world and wonder what it’s like on the other side,"" he said. ""I am here to build bridges and to tear down walls.""

Buttigieg's remarks were a continuation of a unity theme he's emphasized since officially launching his presidential campaign last month. His campaign logo includes a bridge that encapsulates his first name.

Trump sounded out his potential rival's harder-to-pronounce last name at a campaign rally in Florida Wednesday, while ticking through Democratic presidential contenders: ""Boot-edge-edge,"" the president sounded out, ""They say 'edge-edge.'""

On Friday, Trump compared Buttigieg to the longtime mascot of Mad Magazine, a freckled-faced cartoon boy.

""Alfred E. Neuman cannot become president of the United States,"" he told Politico.

Buttigieg, who had to Google the character that was popular long before he was born to understand the jab, made an oblique reference to it Saturday.

He said his teenage self would not have been able to comprehend the fact that he would wake up in Las Vegas one day ""to reports that the president of the United States was apparently trying to get his attention.""

""Let alone if you told him that the president somehow pronounced his name right,"" Buttigieg said as the audience laughed.

Rising star? 7 hurdles facing Democrat Pete Buttigieg's 2020 presidential campaign

The Human Rights Campaign Foundation, the educational arm of the nation’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer civil rights organization, will co-host a forum for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates this fall.

“Anyone in this room understands that politics isn’t theoretical; it is personal,"" Buttigieg said. ""So many of us have a marriage that exists by the grace of a single vote on the U.S. Supreme Court.""

That's why, he said, what matters in Washington is ""not the show."" But ""the way a chain of events starts in one of those big white buildings and reaches into our lives, into our homes, our paychecks, our doctors' offices, our marriages,"" he said. ""That's what's at stake today.""

While just behind the livestock exchange building, Texas Longhorns practice for their 11:30 a.m. cattle drive.

Jaworski said each year, The Herd’s programming teaches 17,000 students about cowboys’ life on the Chisholm trail, which was used to drive cattle from ranches in Texas to railheads in Kansas.

For the last 20 years, that history has been honored with twice-daily cattle drives down Exchange Avenue in the Stockyards National Historic District.

""Fort Worth is cowboys and culture and there's nothing much more Texas than Long Horn Cattle,"" said Betsy Price, Fort Worth Mayor.

According to Visit Fort Worth, ""9 million spectators have watched 14,148 cattle drives,"" during the twice-daily event over the last 20 years.

""You're going to see the cattle walk down at a very slow pace because that's the way it actually occurred 150 years ago,"" said a man with a megaphone to onlookers gathering along the sidewalks before the drive started.

Among the crowd, is the family of Chee Nguyen, who recently graduated from Texas Christian University. Her parents are visiting from Vietnam, and she brought them to the Stockyards.

""Because my parents, they want to explore the history of each place where they come to visit,"" Nguyen said.

"1 arrested, 3 sought in Vero Beach on 'breach of peace' charge alleging sex in public area off 14th Avenue","Vero Beach Police Department (Photo: LAMAUR STANCIL/TCPALM)

VERO BEACH — One woman has been arrested and three other people have warrants out for their arrest, all accused of having sex in public view downtown one afternoon on 14th Avenue.

Police said they got two calls about two couples, about 10 feet apart, engaging in sexual intercourse in a grassy area of a parking lot in the 1900 block of 14th Avenue in full view of passersby and across the street from a restaurant at about 3:20 p.m. April 28.

Myra Olin, 56, who is homeless in Vero Beach, was arrested Thursday night on a charge of disorderly breach of peace.

Francis Rhinehart, 57; Peter Jankowski Jr., 47; and Lisa Goldenberg, 52, all homeless in Vero Beach, according to police, have open warrants for their arrest on the same charge. As of Friday afternoon, they had not been arrested.

A woman who called police said she was driving by the area when she saw the two couples and was shocked. The woman called police and sent pictures to them.

When officers arrived, they said they saw each couple together.

Jankowski Jr. and Olin told the officers ""we were just messing around.""

Officers said Rhinehart and Goldenberg told them they got ""caught up in the moment.""

Vero Beach police Lt. John Pedersen said the incident is ""unique"" for downtown Vero Beach in broad daylight.

""It's not a call that we typically get,"" he said. ""I mean we have had calls over the years of people on the beach or in a car or something where it was in a more private setting, but this was pretty appalling of these people to be engaged in this type of activity.""

Photos and a video of the two couples were circulated on a Vero Beach community Facebook page, prompting many comments from concerned residents. The images were taken down and reposted a few times before being removed for good.

Pedersen said from what he observed and understood from speaking to two witnesses, sexual organs were not plainly observed. He said one of the men's buttocks was clearly seen, but that isn't enough to charge someone with anything more than disorderly breach of peace.

""Do we normally have people having sex openly out in public, no, the answer to that is no,"" Pedersen said.

Former Palm Bay Deputy City Manager Dave Isnardi has been arrested on charges of racketeering, conspiracy to commit extortion and conspiracy to possess controlled substances including oxycodone.

Isnardi is the husband of Brevard County Commissioner Kristine Isnardi.

Dave Isnardi is being represented by Bryan Lober, an attorney who is also a county commissioner. Lober said he has told the Isnardis not to comment on the case to the media.

A second man, Jose Aguiar, a former candidate for the Palm Bay City Council, was also arrested Friday morning and charged with racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering. Aguiar was convicted of conspiracy to sell cocaine in Massachusetts in 1997 and was sentenced to three years and one month in federal prison. It is not clear when he moved to Palm Bay.

All told, Isnardi is charged with two first-degree felonies, which each carry potential penalties of 30 years in prison and three third-degree felonies, each of which carry a potential five-year prison sentence.

The two are being held without bail until they can appear before a judge.

The arrest warrants for the two show that the FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement have been investigating allegations of corruption and undue influence on city officials in Palm Bay since at least 2015. The warrants draw heavily from secret recordings made by a confidential source working with investigators.

The arrest warrants for the two paint a picture of Palm Bay’s city government embroiled in scandal, as Aguiar attempted to influence city officials. Though not arrested or charged, the warrants allege that City Councilman Jeff Bailey had an addiction to oxycodone and that former Councilman Tres Holton regularly had sex with prostitutes and used cocaine. It also alleges that Holton had obtained prostitutes for Mayor William Capote while the men were in Tallahassee.

The arrest warrants allege Isnardi and Aguiar were plotting to use a hidden camera to record Holton and Bailey having sex with prostitutes at “the Clubhouse,” a Canova Street home then owned by Aguiar, where Holton, Bailey and other Palm Bay officials hung out. They then planned to use those recordings to blackmail Holton and Bailey into voting the way Aguiar wanted on various issues including rezoning a property that Aguiar owned to allow him to open a scrap metal business that Isnardi would be a partner in.

It isn't clear from the arrest documents whether the two ever did set up a camera or make any recordings.

“Is this a joke?” Holton said, when contacted by FLORIDA TODAY and told the allegations against him in the arrest warrants. “You’re going to have to call me back,” Holton said, not responding further to questions.

Bailey could not be immediately reached for comment.

The warrants also say that Isnardi and Aguiar plotted to plant drugs in Bailey’s car and arrange for a Brevard County sheriff’s deputy to perform a traffic stop on Bailey and to discover the drugs. The warrants also state that former City Manager Gregg Lynk was aware of the plot to set up Bailey, but didn’t want to know the details or participate in the effort.

Lynk could not be reached immediately for comment. He was fired in November after the city council voted to remove him by a 3-2 vote. Bailey introduced that measure and Capote voted in favor of the firing along with newly elected Councilman Kenny Johnson.

The warrants also indicate that Aguiar had previously supplied Bailey with drugs and that he also offered Bailey money to make a down payment on a house, which Bailey declined.

During a subsequent interview with investigators, Bailey admitted that Aguiar offered him a house and that he received $300 in cash from Aguiar, according to arrest documents. Bailey didn’t report Aguiar’s donation, which he held onto until turning it over to the FBI during the interview.

In a subsequent interview with the FBI, set up by Isnardi's then attorney John Murphy, Isnardi admitted to participating in discussions about trying to record Holton and Bailey in compromising positions, according to the arrest documents.

But he denied there was an actual plot to plant drugs in Bailey's car. He did admit, though, that contacted Brevard County Sheriff's Office Agent Jason West about the possibility that there were drugs in Bailey's car and noted that Bailey ""was doing drugs anyway.""

Ultimately, Isnardi claimed the plot was only ""guys talking s---, drinking beers and smoking cigars,"" according to the arrest documents.

The arrest documents show that Aguiar was angry about how Bailey was voting during council meetings and was determined to drive him from office.

""I’m going to kick his ass, he ain’t winning again.” Aguiar was quoted as saying during one recorded conversation. “I don’t know if I should just approach him and grab him by the throat and tell him how it is, or we should, or I should just avoid him…set this m-----f----- up or something?”

Capote said he was surprised to learn from FLORIDA TODAY that his name was mentioned in the arrest warrant as being connected with prostitutes.

He said those allegations are untrue.

“I don’t know who would tell someone that,” Capote said. “That’s profound. This is all new to me. That accusation has no validity.”

Capote said he has been in Tallahassee in the past on city business, meeting with state legislators and other state officials, but he did not hang out with Holton while he was there.

Capote says people may have been trying to taint him for political reasons.

Capote said he was never interviewed by investigators, and that he has no reason to secure a lawyer in this matter.

Lober, the county commissioner representing Isnardi, said that being accused of something is the same as being convicted.

""Dave hasn’t been convicted of anything in relation to these years-old hyper-political allegations. Given the number of individuals allegedly involved and the complexity of the allegations, this is not a case which is likely to be resolved quickly. I have no doubt that the facts will become increasingly clear in the coming months.”

Shows



Flashlight Cabaret image courtest of Orlando Fringe.

From comedy to musicals to spoken word and dance, there are endless performances to attend. The selection can be a bit overwhelming, but luckily, there's a tool to help. The masterminds behind the festival designed the Fringe-O-Matic website to help you plan your festival schedule. To use it, go to the list of shows and choose the options that interest you the most. You have the option to filter by genre and age rating to help you narrow the titles down. Once you've made your selections, you can generate a schedule based on your interests and availability.

Keep in mind that some shows do feature nudity, flashing lights, adult themes and more, so you'll want to chose shows that are most suited with your comfort level.

Among the standout titles are ""Florida Man,"" an interactive comedy based on the Sunshine State's anti-hero; ""Winnie’s Rock Cauldron Cabaret,"" featuring the Sanderson sisters from the Disney Halloween classic ""Hocus Pocus;"" and ""American Homelessness,"" an immersive experience designed to highlight the perils a homeless person faces all while educating the audience on how they can help solve the epidemic.

Tickets

There are two things you need to get into any Fringe show: a ticket and a button. Artists set the price for tickets, ranging anywhere from free to $12. A $1.25 fee added to the cost of the ticket is given to the ticketing company, while the base cost goes directly to the artist. Buttons are available for $10 each and can be used to get into multiple shows, meaning you don’t have to buy individual buttons the way you would tickets, so one button can last you the duration of the festival.

Tickets can be purchased at the venue, at any of the boxes and online in advance, which is recommended for popular showings. Children 12 and under don’t need a button but do need a ticket, while babies don’t need either. Ticket sales are final, so the only time a refund will be issued is if the performer cancels.

Even if you have a ticket, you won't be admitted into the venue if you're late and there's no re-entry if you decide to leave at any point during the performance, so make sure you get there on time.

Holiday creeper asks young girls for sex near bus stop,"Holiday creeper asks young girls for sex near bus stop Video

HOLIDAY, Fla. (WFLA) - An incident near a Pasco County school bus stop has an entire neighborhood frightened.

Two young girls told deputies a man in a car asked them to perform sexual acts.

It happened just before 8 a.m. Thursday morning.

Two girls walking along Ironware Drive near Pleasure Drive got the scare of their lives when a creeper stopped and asked for sex.

A neighbor's security camera recorded the girls, ages 12 and 14, walking to their bus stop.

A man driving a silver 4-door, possibly a Hyundai Genisis, slows, then stops.He takes off when he spots the school bus.

“They were scared. They were in shock. And they tell me they wish they would have done more. But they were scared,” said the girls' mother, Jill, who asked we not use her last name.

She said the incident traumatized them and it makes her wonder about safety in the neighborhood.

“It scares me to think that my daughters can't even walk down the street to get on the school bus, ya know? 7:40 in the morning, my children should be able to walk down the street,” said Jill.

Parents are convinced, this isn't the first time the same guy has struck.

Two months ago, another mother believes he approached her 14-year-old daughter as she checked the mailbox.

“By the time I heard her screaming, that I came out, I ran a little bit towards where the car was, he was too fast for me. I couldn't get his tag or anything,” said Natalie, who also asked not to use her last name.

This time, the creeper didn't mention sex.

“She says that what she heard him say was 'come here, come here.' And that's when she ran and started screaming,” said Natalie.

The school bus stop incident is prompting these parents to make changes in their routines.

“They're not leaving my sight. I'm [driving] them to the bus stop every day,” said Jill.

For the creeper, Natalie has this message.

“He really needs to stop doing this. He needs to turn himself in. I think this is very very very wrong, what he's doing. Especially to little girls.They're terrified,” said Natalie.

The sad thing is, their bus stop is only two streets away.",http://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/holiday-creeper-asks-young-girls-for-sex-near-bus-stop/1993375277,2019-05-10T00:31:08Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"
Jaguars release backup QB Cody Kessler along with 5 others,"- The Jacksonville Jaguars released quarterback Cody Kessler on Thursday, clearing the way for rookie Gardner Minshew to become Nick Foles' backup.

Kessler started four games in place of Blake Bortles last December, completing 64 percent of his passes for 553 yards and a touchdown. He also threw an interception and fumbled four times.

Minshew, a sixth-round draft pick, signed his rookie contract and will take part in a three-day rookie camp beginning Friday.

Tight end Josh Oliver (third round), running back Ryquell Armstead (fifth) and defensive tackle Dontavius Russell (seventh) also signed rookie deals Thursday.

To make room for them on the team's 90-man roster, the Jaguars released linebacker Blair Brown, guard Parker Ehinger and running backs Dimitri Flowers and back David Williams. They also parted ways with linebacker Donald Payne after he failed a physical.

Police chase suspect on foot after vehicle pursuit,"- A man wanted out of Pennsylvania is behind bars, after a big takedown in Florida. It surprised many residents in the Town of Windermere, who were just getting ready to start their day.

It began as a traffic stop for a speeding violation. Officers say 41-year-old Jason Baldwin refused to stop, but when he did eventually pull over, he got out of his vehicle and fled on foot.

A chase in a usually quiet, residential neighborhood ensued, as children headed to school. Officers say Baldwin tried hiding outside Gracie Freeman’s home, in an effort to elude officers.

""He saw my dad was checking the sprinklers and he rolled out and went there and tried to go through this gate here,” explained Freeman. “We locked all the doors and just sat in the closet and waited.”

Freeman said she saw the suspect run away from the house, across the street, jumping over a fence into people’s yards.

“Everyone was freaking out.”

”He had gone into several back yards. We had school children waiting at the bus stops in the area. We had individuals walking through the side streets,”

said Deputy Chief Jennifer Treadwell of the Windermere Police Department.

During the chase, an officer suffered a cut to his leg, Treadwell said.

“When he was running after the suspect, he threw the trash cans in his path to toward his efforts to take him into custody, so fortunately his injuries are minor.”

A K-9 officer was able to track Baldwin and catch him nearby. He is wanted for an occupied burglary in Harrisburg, PA. Now, he faces additional charges of fleeing and eluding, aggravated battery, burglary, and resisting with violence. Authorities said he was also driving on a suspended license.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/police-chase-suspect-on-foot-after-vehicle-pursuit,2019-05-10T00:13:51Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA"

"Men accused of stealing cars, fleeing arrest face judge","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - A man accused of stealing two vehicles and speeding through multiple counties as authorities tracked his movements by air was ordered to be held without bond during a court appearance Thursday morning.

Orange County deputies said Wednesday's incident began when they saw a stolen truck in the area of East Colonial Drive and Avalon Park Boulevard. As authorities followed the vehicle without their lights activated, the occupants parked the truck and got into a white Dodge Charger.

Jacob Scott, 22, was driving the stolen Charger with passengers 19-year-old Roil Cambio and a 13-year-old boy inside on Wednesday, according to the affidavit.

Sky 6 video from the incident showed the Charger speeding on State Road 520 as authorities tracked it by air.

Records show Scott bailed out of the Charger on Wednesday and hopped onto a stolen motorcycle. The two other suspects fled on foot but were eventually caught, according to authorities.

Deputies said Scott was arrested at about 11:40 a.m. in the 16300 block of East Colonial Drive, where he abandoned the motorcycle.

Scott and Cambio are both facing multiple charges of grand theft. Cambio's bond was set at $11,450 on Thursday.

Court records show Scott has gone to jail at least three times since January.

The 13-year-old suspect is expected to face a judge at the Juvenile Justice Center on Thursday afternoon.

Jesse Watters Finds a Way to Jeer Ilhan Omar's Death Threats,"Screenshot: Fox News

Fox News host Jesse Waters—known for spewing racist, sexist putrid garbage all over the network—simply couldn’t help himself on Wednesday evening’s episode of The Five, shit-talking Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and shrugging off the arrests of people who have made threats on her life.



Speaking about Meghan McCain’s appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers, where Meyers challenged McCain’s comments tying Omar to anti-Semitism, including the California synagogue shooting, Watters questioned why “the left” would stand up for Omar.



“I think the reason they do that, it’s not because they want to protect her personally, because she’s not that talented, she doesn’t raise a lot of money, she’s not that likable or empathetic,” Watters said. “The left wants to protect the ability of the left to traffic in anti-Semitism.”

Only on Fox News would a woman being “likable” and a “money maker” be a necessary excuse to defend her against threats on her life.

“I don’t think you want to be [to the left] when you’re in line for that late night show, and when everybody gets death threats. McCain gets them big time. We get them, we don’t whine about them,” Watters said, willfully minimizing the credible threats against Omar and the multiple arrests made in connection to them.



In New York, a man was arrested in April for calling Omar’s office and threatening to “put a bullet in her fucking skull,” later telling FBI agents “if our forefathers were still alive, they’d put a bullet in her head.” Two weeks later, a second man was arrested in Florida after making threats to Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib in a voicemail he left for Tlaib.

Officers responded to the area of to the 8900 block of Riverlachen Way in Riverview sometime around 1:45 p.m. The house deputies responded to is being remodeled and no one currently lives there.

"Suspect in Miami Beach murder claims he's a serial killer, police say","MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - A convicted sex offender accused of killing an elderly Miami Beach man last month has confessed to the crime along with six other murders in Florida, Georgia and California, authorities said.

Ernesto Rodriguez, a spokesman for the Miami Beach Department, said officers could not corroborate the claims of 32-year-old Nicholas Brent Gibson.

Gibson was arrested in New York City on Sunday after a struggle in which at least one officer was injured. The U.S. Marshals Service was also searching for Gibson for a probation violation for failing to register as a sex offender.

Miami Beach detectives interviewed Gibson in New York, where he confessed to the additional killings. Officers are now working to determine whether the confessions are credible, Rodriguez said.

Police said he killed 77-year-old Erik Stocker. Officers found Stocker dead April 30 inside his unit at the Tribeca apartments in the 1500 block of Michigan Avenue after neighbors noticed a foul order coming from the apartment. Police said he had been dead for about 10 days.

Detectives have not said how Stocker was killed or released a motive for the killing. However, the Miami Herald has reported that sources said Gibson used ""some type of sword"" to kill Stocker.

Rodriguez said detectives have found additional physical evidence linking Gibson to the murder. He said Gibson will be charged once he is transported back to Miami Beach.

"Florida man arrested, refused to remove bumper sticker from vehicle","LAKE CITY, Fla. - A Lake City man who was jailed after refusing to remove what authorities called an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window said Tuesday that he is fighting the charges and will defend his constitutional right to free speech.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence, a Columbia County Sheriff's Office report said.

Webb told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he plans to file a wrongful arrest lawsuit against the sheriff's office.

""I'm tired of police forces thinking they are above the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,"" Webb said.

A deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a vehicle sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite, the sheriff's report said. When told about the reason for the stop, Webb reportedly said, ""They're just words.""

Wedd said the deputy seemed angry from the start of the traffic stop.

""Like the whole time, he was just really rude,"" Webb told the AP. ""It just felt to me like his goal was to get me in jail.""

The deputy said he asked Webb how a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words, and Webb said that ""it would be up to the parent.""

Webb told the AP that he didn't imagine the sticker doing any serious damage to children.

""I've had parents drive by me with their kids taking pictures,"" Webb said. ""They point and laugh and giggle, and they go on about their day.""

Webb said he had the sticker on his truck for less than a week before his traffic stop. He said he and several friends had all decided to get similar stickers as a group joke.

""I guess this cop just didn't find it funny, and he just thought he has to put me in jail,"" Webb said.

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court, the report said. The deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused.

""I said I'm not removing any letters on my sticker because that's in violation of my First Amendment rights as a tax-paying citizen,"" Webb said.

The deputy then charged Webb with resisting and took him to jail. Webb was released an hour later on $2,500 bond.

Webb's vehicle had been towed when he was arrested. He said the sticker was still in place when he retrieved the vehicle.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida released a statement Tuesday questioning why the sheriff's office was wasting resources on such a traffic stop.

""Shouldn't police officers spend their time serving and protecting communities and not pulling Floridians over for speech that is already protected by the First Amendment?"" ACLU spokeswoman Casey Bruce-White said in a statement. ""Using the excuse that a child would see and ask questions about this particular bumper sticker is absurd.""

The sheriff's office told the AP that deputy had probable cause of a violation of criminal law and took action. ""If the law is faulty then the legislature can address that or if the law is unconstitutional then the judiciary will address it, Sgt. Murray Smith said, adding that the defendant will have his day in court.

Webb said he wasn't even aware of the state's obscenity law, but after reviewing it since his arrest, he said it needs to be changed. He acknowledged that his sticker could be considered vulgar by some, but the law doesn't really define what that is.

""What's vulgar to me might not be vulgar to somebody else,"" Webb said.

"German, Urshela help Yanks top Rays 4-3, Glasnow exits early","Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (Photo by Julio Aguilar/Getty Images)

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - Domingo German became the majors' first seven-game winner, Gio Urshela got a key hit set up by a pair of odd bounces and the New York Yankees beat the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3 on Friday night.

The injury-filled Yankees pulled within a half-game of the AL East-leading Rays in the first of 19 meetings between the teams this season.

German (7-1) was matched up against Tyler Glasnow (6-1), who left in the sixth inning with right forearm tightness.

Glasnow struck out nine in 5 1/3 innings. He signaled for a trainer after striking out Gleyber Torres and was pulled.

German allowed three runs and five hits over five innings. Aroldis Chapman, the fourth Yankees reliever, worked the ninth for his ninth save.

Home runs by Austin Meadows and Ji-Man Choi gave the Rays a 3-2 lead entering the sixth.

Gary Sanchez opened the Yankees sixth with an infield single on a popup that struck the highest of four overhanging catwalks - approximately 185 feet high - and fell in the infield as Tampa Bay players scrambled to catch the carom.

Clint Frazier followed with a single and Torres fanned, finishing Glasnow. Emilio Pagan relieved and Miguel Andujar hit a grounder that took a crooked hop off the mound and went for an infield single that loaded the bases. Urshela then delivered a two-run single for a 4-3 lead.

On Thursday night, Urshela entered in the seventh for defense and hit a two-run single in the eighth of a 3-1 victory over Seattle.

The Rays loaded the bases on two walks and a bunt single in the seventh, but Adam Ottavino worked out of the jam by striking out Tommy Pham and getting Choi to hit a grounder that second baseman DJ LeMahieu fielded, raced to second for an out and threw to first to complete a nifty double play.

Meadows, reinstated from the 10-day injured list after missing 15 games with a strained right thumb, hit a two-run homer and Choi added a solo shot two batters later off German as the Rays went up in the fifth. German had allowed just two homers overall in six previous starts.

New York took a 2-0 lead in the first when LeMahieu scored on rookie Nick Ciuffo's passed ball and Torres' RBI single.

The Yankees currently have 12 players on the injured list, including Aaron Judge, Aaron Hicks, Giancarlo Stanton, Didi Gregorius, Luis Severino and James Paxton.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Yankees: LHP Jordan Montgomery (Tommy John surgery) will increase from 30 to 35 pitches and start incorporating curveballs in his next bullpen session Tuesday. ""I'm starting to kind of see some light at the end of the tunnel in the bullpens when I'm throwing the ball and it's going where I want it to,"" Montgomery said. ... Paxton (left knee inflammation) is playing catch.

Rays: 3B Matt Duffy (left hamstring strain) is scheduled to resume a rehab assignment with Class A Charlotte Monday. ... C Mike Zunino (left quadriceps strain) joined backup C Michael Perez (strained right oblique) on the 10-day injured list.

Former Blue Wahoos manager Pat Kelly awaits flashback as Chattanooga skipper,"CLOSE Blue Wahoos honor manager Pat Kelly, celebrate 2017 championship season Bill Vilona/bvilona@pnj.com

In preparing for Thursday night’s game, Chattanooga Lookouts manager Pat Kelly took a quick glance ahead at the next opponent’s roster.

It was the one presenting an emotional connection. The franchise he spent three memorable seasons managing.

“This will be different, for sure,” Kelly said, laughing, the former Blue Wahoos manager.

While he has no relationship with any current Pensacola players or coaches, Kelly and his pitching coach Danny Darwin recognize how fate presents a unique dynamic.

After last year’s swap of affiliations, 13 former Lookouts players now in Pensacola will reconnect Saturday against Chattanooga to begin a five game road series. Kelly and Darwin will manage against the franchise they once celebrated success. The Lookouts will be in Pensacola on Aug. 13-17.

On Sept. 8, 2017, Kelly and Darwin were doused with champagne at Blue Wahoos Stadium, after the Cincinnati Reds’ former Double-A affiliate won a Southern League co-championship.

The team sharing the title in that hurricane-shortened postseason? The Lookouts, then the Minnesota Twins affiliate.

“I think for both Danny and myself, it will be a strange feeling,” said Kelly about the upcoming series at Chattanooga’s AT&T Stadium. “I think we’ve been in the game long enough, been traded and fired enough, that we’ve done this before. But it’s definitely different.

“We had a great seven-year run (as Reds affiliate) in Pensacola and enjoyed every minute of it. Especially the three years I was there. And now it’s the Twins turn to enjoy Pensacola and hopefully we can come into Chattanooga (this season) and have some fun.”

Adding to the scenario, Kelly managed the Chattanooga Lookouts 25 years ago (1993-94) when they were a Reds affiliate during a 21-year period.

After being named the Blue Wahoos’ third manager in franchise history in December 2014, Kelly steered the ball club to its greatest run of success. The Blue Wahoos reached the playoffs each year, culminating in 2017 with a trophy and championship rings.

During those three seasons, he developed lasting friendships and enjoyed a stadium providing proximity to connect with fans.

“It was just fun to come to the ballpark every day,” said Kelly, 63, a Santa Maria, Calif. native. “It was a great facility, a great city, and the fans who came to the ballpark made it all worthwhile.

“They were very supportive. I made a lot of friends.”

Entering the weekend series against the South division-leading Blue Wahoos, Kelly sees it as a gauge for his North Division team.

“Just glancing at (Blue Wahoos) roster, some of the names are familiar,” Kelly said. “I know just following baseball, they have a lot of the top prospects for the Twins.

“And obviously, looking at the standings, they are off to a great start. So I think it is going to be a really good challenge for us.

The Lookouts (17-14 before Thursday’s game) had a sluggish start, losing seven of eight games, beginning in mid-April. They have since won the past two series, taking four of five games each time.

“We got off to a really bad start with some young players. But we really hit our stride the last couple weeks. I am kinda looking forward to (facing Blue Wahoos), because I think it’s a great challenge for our young kids, just to see how far we have advanced in this first month and a half.

“We came into the year with a lot of questions with the pitching staff. So we felt like it was basically trying to get everyone’s feet wet and see how we did. We split our first two series, which I felt we were fortunate to do.

“Then Mississippi came in and knocked our socks off… they beat us four of five. I think it was eye opening for our players.”

The Lookouts were tied as of Thursday with the Tennessee Smokies for the best team batting average (.255) in the Southern League. Several of their batters among the league’s top 50 – Jose Siri, T.J. Friedl, Gavin LaValley – were in Pensacola last season.

“We are going to try to prove the opposite of what we did in Pensacola… that you can win with offense and give up a lot of runs,” said Kelly, jokingly. “But this is a much better park to hit in (Chattanooga) from an offensive standpoint.

“I think our pitching is starting to settle down. Having Danny working with those guys, they get better every start and the bullpen is starting to solidify a little bit.”

After seeing so many of the players he managed reach the major leagues in recent seasons, Kelly returned last year himself as a bench coach for the Reds. He was in the dugout with then-interim manager Jim Riggleman, the Blue Wahoos manager in their inaugural 2012 season.

Both were elevated after the Reds opted to fire Bryan Price just 18 games into the 2018 season. Riggleman is now bench coach for the New York Mets. After the Reds chose David Bell as new manager and he hired his staff, Kelly opted for a Double-A return in the Reds organization to help players advance.

“(Last year) was fantastic for me,” Kelly said. “It was a great experience to be exposed to the big leagues and get exposed with players who had played for me. You are seeing through their struggles. And to work for Jim Riggleman was fantastic.

“What a terrific man, I love the way he runs a ballgame. He is always two steps ahead of the other manager. It was very educational for me… being able to sit next to a guy who I felt like was one step ahead of me a lot of times.

“So I felt like I got a lot out of it.”

He’s hoping for the same in a new situation this year.

Somerset man sentenced to 50 months in prison for nonprofit Medicare fraud,"CLOSE News you can use Asbury Park Press

TRENTON - A Somerset man has been sentenced to prison for using a nonprofit to defraud the Medicare program of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Seth Rehfuss, 44, was sentenced Friday in federal court to 50 months in prison using the purported nonprofit The Good Samaritans of America to defraud the Medicare program of more than $430,000.

Rehfuss convinced hundreds of senior citizens to submit to genetic testing as part of the scheme, U.S. Attorney of the District of New Jersey Craig Carpenito said in a news release.

Rehfuss previously pleaded guilty to a superseding information charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud.

According to documents filed in the case and statements made in court, Rehfuss admitted that he used The Good Samaritans of America to gain access to groups of senior citizens in various low-income senior citizen housing complexes and persuaded them to submit to genetic tests without any involvement of a health care professional, according to a news release.

Contrary to what he told the senior citizens and staff at the housing complexes, Rehfuss was a sales representative for laboratories, a fact he concealed from his targets, according to the release. In order to convince senior citizens to submit to genetic testing, Rehfuss used fear-based tactics during the presentations, including suggesting the senior citizens would be vulnerable to heart attacks, stroke, cancer and suicide if they did not have the genetic testing.

To get the tests authorized, Rehfuss used advertisements on Craigslist to recruit health care providers for the scheme, the release stated.

The health care providers were paid thousands of dollars per month by Rehfuss and others to sign their names to requisition forms authorizing testing for patients they never examined or had any interaction with, according to the release.

EARLIER: Somerset man indicted on Medicare fraud

Rehfuss and his conspirators, Sheila Kahl and Kenneth Johnson, established email accounts, phone numbers, and made-up “office manager” names for the requisition forms that made it appear the health care providers were actually treating the patients being swabbed and would be evaluating the test results, prosecutors said.

Rehfuss, Kahl, Johnson and others caused the Medicare program to pay two clinical laboratories for the fraudulent test claims that the scheme generated, according to prosecutors. They obtained and divided more than $100,000 in commission payments from the laboratories, according to the release.

Rehfuss and others were also actively working toward expanding the scheme outside of New Jersey into other states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, South Carolina, Michigan, Mississippi, Florida, Tennessee and Arizona.

In addition to the prison term, Rehfuss was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay restitution of $434,963 and forfeiture of $66,844.

Kahl, 47, of Ocean County, previously pleaded guilty and is scheduled to be sentenced May 13. Johnson, 39, of Lorton, Virginia, pleaded guilty and is scheduled to be sentenced May 20.

Carpenito credited special agents of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services – Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Scott J. Lampert; special agents of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey; and the Cape May County Department of Aging and Disability Services, with the investigation leading to the sentencing.

"Puppy found badly burned, tossed in trash in Coachella","(CNN/WFLA) - Another horrific case of animal abuse surfaced over the weekend in Coachella, California.

NBC Palm Springs reports a woman found a 2-week-old puppy that had been badly burned and thrown in the trash.

“It was so horrible…sorry,"" Alexandra Zazueta recalled. “Her belly was stuck to a plastic bag and she cried a lot when I was trying to remove her from the plastic bag.”

Zazueta said the puppy smelled like it was rotting and its skin was falling off.

""I visibly saw lacerations down from her mid back all the way to her back legs. Her tail was cut, so her skin flap was just hanging off of her tail,"" she recalled. ""My mom was like you know what. Like maybe she'll pass away. And I was like no we can't give up. But if it happens she's not going to die in a box or in a bag like if she was trash. So (inaudible).""

""The puppy was tossed into this dumpster left to die rotting inside in over 100-degree temperatures. Now the question becomes why does this keep happening?"" said Luzdelia Caballero.

The incident comes weeks after Deborah Caldwell, 53, was seen tossing seven puppies in a dumpster in the same town. She was charged with seven felony counts of injuring the 3-day-old puppies and seven misdemeanor counts of abandoning them. She could face a maximum of seven years in prison.

""As much as we are shocked and then of course saddened to see the penalties not maybe as stiff as everyone would like to see, it's just that's the reality in California,"" said a man interviewed by the station. ""There are a lot of people harming humans and have been convicted and then released. So it's our world.""

The puppy is recovering at a clinic and is said to be on the up and up. It already has a new name and a home.

“Yes, Hope has a home and she has four other dogs waiting for her. And we are so happy and can’t wait to bring her home.”",https://www.wfla.com/national/puppy-found-badly-burned-tossed-in-trash/1994299047,2019-05-10T12:41:14Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"

Autographs and action at 5 Flags Meet the Drivers Night,"CLOSE Chase Purdy wins weather plagued Allen Turner Snowflake 100 amid terrible weather at Five Flags Speedway Bill Vilona, bvilona@pnj.com

Bill Tutchtone figures he was a few laps away from heading back into retirement.

Tutchtone, 46, raced once in 2012 and hadn’t raced a full schedule at Five Flags Speedway since the late 2000s.

He wasn’t feeling like a comeback tour was a smart idea following a ninth-place finish in the Faith Chapel Outlaws season opener on March 9 during the ARCA Menards Series Pensacola 200.

“I’m very competitive. Around Valentine’s this year, I was so nauseated thinking about how bad I’d do,” Tutchtone said. “I was real apprehensive about it. Then, after the ARCA race, I was seriously thinking that if I did not perform well at the next practice, I was going to tell (car owner Ronnie Enfinger) to put somebody else in the car.”

Thankfully, it all clicked at the next Outlaws feature last month.

Tutchtone slid by defending Outlaws Snowball Derby champion Jeremy Pate 10 laps from the white flag and pulled away from the rest of the field to collect his first career Outlaws victory and his first checkered flag in a decade.

“Honest to God, it was the wildest thing I’ve ever been a part of,” Tutchtone said. “The emotions everybody else had, man People that have known me for years that you wouldn’t necessarily think would have those emotions. They were speechless and couldn’t get out what they wanted to say.

“A lotta things have changed. A lotta things have happened. But, it still felt like one big family.”

Tutchtone along with Five Flags’ most competitive division are back in action on tonight's Meet the Drivers Night at the famed half-mile asphalt oval.

The WCIparts.com Pro Trucks, The Dock on Pensacola Beach Sportsmen, and the Lloyd’s Glass Pure Stocks round out a blockbuster group of drivers, who will sign autographs, hand out hero cards and other souvenirs on the front straightaway.

Gates open at 5 p.m. today, qualifying is set for 6:45, and racing will begin approximately at 8. Admission is $15 for adults; $12 for seniors, military, and students (ages 12-17); and free for children 11-and-under.

Tutchtone has been coming to Pensacola’s high banks since he was a three-year-old toddler. To get a chance to interact with the fans rekindles his own nostalgia.

Bubba Winslow, another Outlaws driver, shared his memories of meeting drivers as a kid.

“(Meet the Drivers Night) was one of the biggest things I remember as kid,” Winslow said. “You couldn’t get into the pits back then. I remember watching guys like Okie Mason. He was always super nice. He never had a bad attitude, and was one of the guys I always looked up to.

“It’s something special when you see kids down there on the track. They recognize the car before the driver, but then they make the connection.”

Winslow, who leads the Outlaws points standings through two races, owns a pair of top-four finishes.

“This class, you go to the racetrack, and five people could win,” Tutchtone said. “You have to be on top of your game to beat ‘em. That’s the kinda stuff I like. I love seeing this class grow.”",http://rssfeeds.pnj.com/~/601820454/0/pensacola/home~Autographs-and-action-at-Flags-Meet-the-Drivers-Night/,2019-05-10T10:30:26Z,Pensacola News Journal,"101 E Romana St, Pensacola, FL 32502, USA"
"Sanibel officer remembered as excellent officer, better person, chief says","CLOSE FHP Master Sgt. Daniel Hinton's funeral procession Michael Braun, MBRAUN@NEWS-PRESS.COM

The Sanibel police officer who died after a training exercise Monday was known as an excellent officer and an even better person.

Officer Anthony Neri, 63, began his career with the department in 2012 as a civilian police aide working traffic, and was promoted as a full-time patrol officer in 2015.

He always had a positive attitude, Sanibel Police Chief William Dalton said.

""The traffic job can be very trying, but he excelled at it,"" Dalton said. ""He always had a smile on his face. It's hard to believe you can do that kind of job and keep such a positive attitude.""

Neri was participating in a training exercise when he collapsed, according to a news release. He was taken to Health Park Hospital in Fort Myers, where he died.

More: Sanibel Police Officer dies after training exercise

Sanibel officials said Thursday that he was participating in a Physical Abilities Test proctored by Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno at the Lee County Sheriff's gun range.

The test simulates what an officer would experience on duty, and evaluates essential knowledge, skills and abilities required of an entry-level officer, according to city documents.

In six minutes and four seconds, officers sprint a few hundred yards, drag a 150-pound dummy and complete other tasks, including an obstacle course, that test physical skills they'd need in the field.

It's unclear which task Neri was completing when he collapsed.

Experts say deaths during training can happen for a number of reasons that can vary across agencies.

Seth Stoughton, an associate professor of law at the University of South Carolina, said either the training is appropriate and the death, while tragic, is coincidental — or that the training is in fact inappropriate.

""One possibility is that the training was entirely appropriate and these were really unfortunate and tragic events,"" Stoughton said. ""Or the officer might be in the middle of a dynamic defensive tactics training block where their heart rate is up, they're physically straining and they have a heart attack. Then their death may have been the result of training, but that training was still appropriate.""

Sometimes it boils down to inappropriate training, he said. That's training that doesn't simulate conditions the officer would experience on the job.

Once an agency meets state-mandated training requirements, it's free to add additional training. It's up to the agency to make sure the training is appropriate, and to make sure the officer is fit enough to participate, Stoughton said.

For instance, ""you can't expect a 60-year-old officer to do everything a 22-year-old officer could do,"" he said.

Stoughton spent five years as an officer with the Tallahassee Police Department, and has studied policing as an academic for the last seven years.

Neri was seen as a leader in the department, Chief Dalton said.

""He was an older officer, and served as a mentor to some of our newer and younger officers,"" Dalton said. ""He was what we needed as a community police officer. He was excellent at it.""

In 2017, Neri was elected by his peers to serve as their representative on the City of Sanibel Police Pension Board.

Because the department is so small, with fewer than 30 sworn officers, Dalton said he sees those who serve under him every day.

""It's like we've lost someone in our family,"" Dalton said. ""It's just very difficult and tragic.""

Neri had previously worked for three years as a police officer with the Union Township in the New Jersey Police Department, and then spent 30 years as a revenue officer with the United States Department of Treasury.

Neri's mother and wife, both reached Wednesday, declined to comment.

Linda Ruetsch, the officer's former wife of 24 years, said Neri was the nicest man she'd ever met.

""He was very quiet and would never hurt a soul. He really cared about his family, and loved and respected his parents and three sisters,"" Ruetsch said. ""Family was very important to Anthony.""

Neri and Ruetsch met in New Jersey when they were in their early 20s, she said. She was in nursing school, and he was studying to become an officer.

The pair dated for a while, and eventually married, she said. Although they wouldn't remain married for the rest of their lives, things were amicable during the split and they stayed in touch.

Neri spoke often of his plans to retire and move to Florida, Ruetsch said.

""He achieved his dreams,"" she said.

Upstate man finds massive ‘psychedelic’ caterpillar that becomes huge moth,"Travelers Rest couple kept eye on cocoon for months until moth emerged

A Travelers Rest man found a massive “psychedelic” caterpillar almost a year ago, and he and his wife kept tabs on it for months until it recently became a huge, beautiful moth.Kathie Tolson said her husband, Ed, found the wildly colorful caterpillar June 25, 2018, in their yard. That day, the caterpillar spun a large cocoon in their azalea bush.A cocoon is an external structure built by caterpillars to protect themselves during their pupal stage. The cocoon’s function is like that of a butterfly chrysalis, but chrysalises are not spun. They are the hardened bodies of butterfly pupas. The Tolsons watched over the cocoon for 10 months. (See video above of cocoon, moth)“On April 23, she emerged and had a gentleman caller visit for much of the day at the base of her cocoon,” Kathie Tolson said.She said when the moths went their separate ways at dusk, the male moth landed on her husband, as if to say goodbye. Tolson shared pictures of the moth, from caterpillar to emergence, with WYFF News 4’s uLocal Carolinas Facebook group.The moth was a cecropia, the largest moth in North America, with a wingspan of up to 7 inches.Cecropias live in hardwood forests from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic coast, ranging as far north as Nova Scotia and as far south as Florida.

Their whole purpose is to mate, lay eggs and start the cycle again.

Man reunited with stolen motorcycle after recognizing it on the news during police pursuit,"- An Orange County is man is thrilled to be reunited with his motorcycle, just hours after it was stolen.

Chris Rodrigues says his $2,500 bike was stolen early Wednesday morning. but a few hours later, he was shocked to see it on his television. It was during news coverage of a police pursuit in East Orlando, when Rodrigues noticed the bike being chased look awfully similar to his.

“Seen the color bike and said that kind of looks like my bike, I look at it a little more, it’s definitely my bike,” said Rodrigues.

But as Rodrigues was watching the news coverage Wednesday morning, he remembered he left the bike’s gas tank nearly empty.

“That’s why he pulled over, he ran out of gas. I had one bar left and riding like that, you can’t get that far,” said Rodrigues. “It was pretty funny, I was laughing at him on TV.”

He says the lack of gas may be the reason the suspect dumped the bike, ultimately resulting in his capture.

Rodrigues says it is one of the craziest things that ever happened to him. He did not think he would ever see his bike again, so he is happy it is back in his possession.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/man-reunited-with-stolen-motorcycle-after-recognizing-it-on-the-news-during-police-pursuit,2019-05-08T22:53:20Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA"
Man arrested after refusing to remove 'I eat a**' sticker from truck window,"Man arrested after refusing to remove 'I eat a**' sticker from truck window Video

LAKE CITY, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say a Florida man was jailed after refusing to remove an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window.

A Columbia County Sheriff's Office report says 23-year-old Dillon Shane Webb was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence.

It says a deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite. The sticker said ""I eat a--,"" according to the Lake City Reporter.

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court.

Officials say the deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part but Webb refused, citing his First Amendment free speech rights. The deputy then charged Webb with resisting and took him to jail.

Webb was later released on $2,500 bond. Jail records didn't list an attorney.

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - A South Florida man on business in the Tampa Bay area claims he was harassed by Starbucks employees at the company's Brandon store.

Lorne Green says he's been to that location before, usually with his white colleague, and never had any problems.

At a news conference on Wednesday, Green explained that his trip to the Starbucks at 2350 West Brandon Boulevard went horribly wrong on April 22.

Green claims he walked in to use the bathroom before placing his order and heard an employee say ""the big black guy is headed for the bathroom.""

As Green used the restroom, he told reporters that employees kept banging on the door asking if he needed fire and rescue.

Green called Starbucks corporate to explain what was happening. He recorded that phone call, playing a part of it for reporters Wednesday afternoon.

He said he began to fear for his life when employees said they were calling the police.

""I felt humiliated,"" Green said. ""Completely defeated. They had wronged me, and now they were going to call the cops on me?""

Hillsborough County deputies arrived and issued him a citation for trespassing, according to Green's attorney, civil rights lawyer Jasmine Rand.

Man dies after confrontation with deputies in Sorrento,"SORRENTO — A Leesburg man who injured a deputy during a chase Wednesday morning died hours later at the hospital following a “medical episode,” authorities say.

AdventHealth Waterman staff declared 27-year old Sean Christopher Bentley dead shortly before noon Wednesday. The Lake County Sheriff's Office said he was taken there after suffering an undisclosed medical emergency and passing out as he was being treated by EMS.

Deputies were pursuing Bentley on a warrant for failing to appear in court for previous charges of eluding law enforcement. When a deputy confronted him in the morning, Bentley ran to his car, the Sheriff's Office said. The deputy attempted to pull Bentley out of the car after using his taser, but Bentley reportedly put the car in drive and dragged the deputy some distance, injuring his leg.

Not long later, he crashed his car on County Road 437 while being pursued by another deputy. Florida Highway Patrol reported he rear-ended one vehicle and struck a trailer being pulled the opposite direction by a pickup truck. No one was reported injured in the crash. Bentley attempted to flee on foot right after the crash, but Lt. John Herrell, spokesman for the Lake County Sheriff's Office, said he surrendered to deputies' commands to stop in the area of the Eagle Dunes subdivision in Sorrento.

According to Herrell, Bentley began showing signs of a medical emergency a short while later, and EMS was called to the scene. Bentley was aggressive with EMS personnel, deputies reported, and eventually he passed out and was taken to the hospital.

Lehigh Acres man charged in 2018 crash that killed 5-year-old Fort Myers boy,"CLOSE It was a dangerous year on Lee and Collier roads in 2018. Megan Kearney, mkearney@news-press.com

A Lehigh Acres man is facing charges of causing a death while driving without a valid license in a fatal November 2018 crash on Gunnery Road.

Mitchell Buenrostro, 18, remains in Lee County Jail on no bond. He will be arraigned June 20.

A Florida Highway Patrol report said Connor Green, 5, of Fort Myers, was killed in the two-vehicle crash in Lehigh Acres.

The crash happened when Buenrostro, 17 at the time, was driving a 2003 Dodge 1500 pickup westbound on Sunset Road, near the intersection of Gunnery Road.

Buenrostro ran a stop sign at Gunnery, the FHP said, and hit the right side of a 2015 Nissan Quest being driven north on Gunnery by Ashley Green, 33, of Fort Myers.

The impact forced the truck that Buenrostro was driving off the road to the right and it overturned. Green's vehicle traveled off the roadway to the left and struck a ditch.

Connor Green was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash, the FHP said. Ashley Green and a passenger in the Nissan suffered minor injuries. Buenrostro and three teen passengers in the truck also suffered minor injuries.

Florida man arrested for refusing to remove vulgar sticker: 'They're just words',"A Florida man was arrested over the weekend for refusing to remove a sticker from his vehicle’s window that crudely described a person’s sexual appetites.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida’s obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence, a Columbia County Sheriff’s Office report said. The sticker read, “I eat a--,” according to the arrest report obtained by the Lake City Reporter.

FLORIDA MAN DRIVING LAWNMOWER ACCUSED OF STRIKING POLICE CRUISER WHILE DRUNK

When told the reason for the stop, Webb told the deputy, “They’re just words.” Webb told the Associated Press the deputy seemed to be angry from the start of the traffic stop. He said he had the sticker on his truck for less than a week before he was stopped by the deputy.

He told the Associated Press he plans to fight the charges and defend his First Amendment right to free speech.

“I'm tired of police forces thinking they are above the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,” Webb said, adding that he wasn’t aware of the state’s obscenity law. He said he could see why the sticker would be seen as vulgar by some but the law doesn’t really define what that is.

“What's vulgar to me might not be vulgar to somebody else,” Webb said.

The deputy determined probable cause of a violation of criminal law and took action, the sheriff’s office told the Associated Press.

“If the law is faulty then the Legislature can address that or if the law is unconstitutional then the judiciary will address it,” Sgt. Murray Smith said.

Florida man arrested over vulgar sticker on truck,"After being given a notice to appear, the driver refused to remove part of the sticker, citing the First Amendment. That's when the deputy arrested him.

A Lake City man with a crude sticker on the back window of his Chevy truck ended up in the Columbia County jail Sunday after he refused to alter the offending words, citing his right to free speech.

A Columbia County sheriff's deputy pulled the pickup over on U.S. 90 around 5:50 p.m. after seeing the sticker — which stated ""I EAT A**"" in white letters, according to an arrest report. The deputy considered the statement a violation of Florida obscenity laws.

The driver and owner of the truck, Dillon Shane Webb, 23, became defensive when the deputy explained why he had been pulled over.

""They're just words,"" he said, according to the deputy's account.

""I then asked Dillon how a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words,"" the report says. Webb responded that it would be up to the parent.

The deputy issued a notice to appear on the obscenity violation, a second-degree misdemeanor.

Then, the deputy wrote, ""I allowed him to remove one of the letters from the word 'A**' so the statement would no longer be derogatory."" But, he said, Webb refused to do so, citing the First Amendment.

That's when the deputy arrested him on a charge of resisting an officer without violence, a first-degree misdemeanor, and took him to jail. The truck was towed.

Bail was set at $2,500, and Webb was released at 8:50 that evening.

"Troopers: Jacksonville man, 50, killed in I-295 crash","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A Jacksonville man died after a two-vehicle crash Tuesday afternoon on Interstate 295, the Florida Highway Patrol said.

The crash happened about 1:15 p.m. near Dunn Avenue.

According to the Highway Patrol, a Nissan Frontier was traveling in the inside lane and a Nissan Altima was traveling in the outside lane of northbound I-295 when, for unknown reasons, the Frontier drifted to the right, striking the rear of the Altima. Troopers said the Frontier then went off the roadway, struck a metal sign and hit a tree.

The driver of the Frontier, 50-year-old Ronald Knight, was taken to UF Health hospital, where he died, troopers said. The Highway Patrol report shows it's unclear whether he was wearing a seat belt.

Troopers said the driver of the Altima, a 33-year-old Jacksonville man, was able to come to a stop on the shoulder of I-295 after the crash and was not injured.

Pete Buttigieg says Donald Trump's white 'identity politics' contributing to a 'crisis of belonging',"CLOSE Pete Buttigieg, a two-term mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is now running for president at the age of 37. Here's what we know about the man and his campaign. Dwight Adams, dwight.adams@indystar.com

Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg confronted on Saturday what he called a “crisis of belonging” in the country, criticizing President Donald Trump for using “white identity politics” – but also warning his fellow Democrats against elevating one group’s interest above another's.

“The wall I worry about the most is not the president’s fantasy wall on the Mexican border that’s never going to get built anyway,” he said in a speech to gay rights activists. “What I worry about are the very real walls being put up between us as we get divided and carved up.”

The administration, Buttigieg said, uses what he called the most divisive form of ""identity politics"" – white identity politics.

That can leave black women, immigrants, the disabled, displaced auto workers and others feeling like they're living in a different country, Buttigieg said at a Human Rights Campaign gala in Las Vegas.

But Buttigieg, who is openly gay, said there is also some schismatic thinking in the Democratic Party, such as when ""we're told we need to choose between supporting an auto worker and supporting a trans women of color, without stopping to think about the fact that sometimes the auto worker is a trans woman of color and she definitely needs all the support that she can get.""

As Democrats try to determine who in their large field of candidates could best defeat Trump, they've debated whether the party should try to win back white, working class voters or focus instead on energizing core Democratic constituencies including women and racial minorities.

Buttigieg, who has faced questions about seeking the presidential nomination as another white male of privilege, said every person has a story that can be used to either separate – or connect – them to others.

""What every gay person has in common with every excluded person of any kind is knowing what it’s like to see a wall between you and the rest of the world and wonder what it’s like on the other side,"" he said. ""I am here to build bridges and to tear down walls.""

Buttigieg's remarks were a continuation of a unity theme he's emphasized since officially launching his presidential campaign last month. His campaign logo includes a bridge that encapsulates his first name.

Trump sounded out his potential rival's harder-to-pronounce last name at a campaign rally in Florida Wednesday, while ticking through Democratic presidential contenders: ""Boot-edge-edge,"" the president sounded out, ""They say 'edge-edge.'""

On Friday, Trump compared Buttigieg to the longtime mascot of Mad Magazine, a freckled-faced cartoon boy.

""Alfred E. Neuman cannot become president of the United States,"" he told Politico.

Buttigieg, who had to Google the character that was popular long before he was born to understand the jab, made an oblique reference to it Saturday.

He said his teenage self would not have been able to comprehend the fact that he would wake up in Las Vegas one day ""to reports that the president of the United States was apparently trying to get his attention.""

""Let alone if you told him that the president somehow pronounced his name right,"" Buttigieg said as the audience laughed.

The Human Rights Campaign Foundation, the educational arm of the nation’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer civil rights organization, will co-host a forum for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates this fall.

“Anyone in this room understands that politics isn’t theoretical; it is personal,"" Buttigieg said. ""So many of us have a marriage that exists by the grace of a single vote on the U.S. Supreme Court.""

That's why, he said, what matters in Washington is ""not the show."" But ""the way a chain of events starts in one of those big white buildings and reaches into our lives, into our homes, our paychecks, our doctors' offices, our marriages,"" he said. ""That's what's at stake today.""

Sean Doolittle adjusts to unique challenges of expanded role for Nationals,"

Sean Doolittle has made five multi-inning appearances already for the Nationals this season. (Patrick Semansky/Associated Press)

LOS ANGELES — It’s the gap between the eighth inning and ninth, between Sean Doolittle’s most recent pitch and his next one, that has forced the Washington Nationals closer to get creative this season.

There have been times in Doolittle’s career, like last year, that followed a very specific rhythm: Start stretching in the sixth. Start throwing in the bullpen in the eighth. Enter in the ninth, with the score close, and get three outs to seal the win or hold a tie. Then wake up the next day and do it again.

But this year has jumbled his routines because, given the Nationals’ bullpen struggles, Manager Dave Martinez has needed him outside the final inning. So there Doolittle was, between the eighth and ninth in Philadelphia on April 9, throwing 10 balls into a net as hard as he could to keep his arm loose. Or in Denver on April 23, riding an exercise bike to keep his adrenaline flowing. Or in Los Angeles this past Friday, stretching and throwing in the batting cage before finishing off a win with 15 pitches.

The 32-year-old is familiar with warming up quickly, working back-to-back days, getting the call when situations start to resemble fire drills. Yet he had not been a multi-inning reliever for the Nationals until this year, at least not consistently, and with that comes the challenge of not losing strength, rhythm, energy or focus after he finishes one frame and waits to go back out.

“It’s not something I’ve done a lot of in my career,” Doolittle said. “So I really have to work harder to stay loose in between. I’m moving around behind the scenes and trying to stay loose.”

Since joining the Nationals in 2017 in a midseason trade that also brought reliever Ryan Madson from the Oakland Athletics, Doolittle has been one of baseball’s more effective relievers as long as he’s healthy. He has been so far this season, and entered Saturday with a 1.06 ERA, five saves in five opportunities and three wins. Martinez has also used him in the eighth five times, because the Nationals’ bullpen has been otherwise shaky and Trevor Rosenthal, their planned-for setup man, is in Florida trying to rediscover his command.

Doolittle threw more than one inning just five times all of last season — a number slightly skewed because he spent two months on the injured list — and that is why Martinez has to balance caution with using Doolittle how he pleases. Doolittle has appeared only once in the last six days but, before that, had pitched in just less than half of Washington’s games.

“Look, do I want to use Doolittle in the eighth inning all the time? No,” Martinez said on Friday, some 17 hours after Doolittle got the last four outs of a victory. “But sometimes we need to and he understands that.”

It can often feel like the jobs Doolittle had before coming to Washington, even if the Nationals don’t want him getting used to this again. He was a setup man, a lefty specialist and, occasionally, a closer for the A’s during the first 5½ years of his career. That taught him to adapt to all situations. It’s why he doesn’t have the ego of many closers, who believe they should only pitch in the ninth, and is the right fit for Martinez’s hybridized role. And his eighth-inning appearances have mostly been for specific matchups, such as facing lefty Bryce Harper in a big spot on April, or the left-handed Max Muncy with the bases loaded on Friday.

That part is familiar to Doolittle, whose made his living in high-stakes situations. Getting up and down — the baseball term for finishing one inning and then pitching another — is the part he’s readjusting to. He often has a jacket and sweatshirt on between innings to keep a sweat going. He has to move, in the dugout or in the hallways behind it, and will either throw or ride a bike to sustain a high heart rate. He has even had to take two at-bats this year, a rarity for a reliever, and make sure he doesn’t lose steam when standing at the plate.

Closing, for Doolittle, is about maintaining a spike of adrenaline and channeling it into each pitch. That is how he gets his fastball into the mid-90s and succeeds when a game hangs on his left arm. So that only makes that time between innings more important, because it would be so easy for him to start cooling down. The Nationals’ bullpen, with a league-worst 6.24 ERA heading into Saturday’s game against the Dodgers, cannot afford him to slip up. He has been their best arm and, for stretches, Martinez’s only reliable option.

That’s been true in the eighth and the ninth, giving Doolittle another routine to test and iron out.

“I’ve kind of done a little bit of everything,” Doolittle said earlier this season of being used in new ways. “So I feel like I have that experience of doing that and being able to get hot and ready to go.”

"Photo with noose gets California school's principal, 4 teachers placed on leave","Four elementary school teachers in Southern California were placed on administrative leave this week after a photo of them smiling while holding a noose circulated on social media. The school’s principal who reportedly took the photo is also on leave.

One parent claimed, according to KABC-TV of Los Angeles, that the noose was hung from a tree on the grounds of Summerwind Elementary School in Palmdale earlier this month. She also claimed that someone shot video of the teachers laughing and joking about the noose.

An investigation into the photo and the origin of the noose is now underway, district officials said.

Some parents were so upset about the photo that they either temporarily or permanently pulled their kids out of the school Thursday, KABC reported.

""Do you know what they use that for? They use that to hang African-American people -- that's what they do -- and kill them,” parent Tierra Harris explained to her daughter, according to KABC. “They still do it to this day. I don't want you going here because I don't want you to feel like that.”

""It hurts. It absolutely hurts me to the core. It's disgusting and I'm outraged, and I want to see some action and not just administrative leave,” parent Breyan Clemmons said about pulling her child out of the school. “We think that we’re sending them to a school; they’re safe. Never do we think we’re sending them to a plantation where they got nooses hanging up, and holding on to nooses,” she told the Antelope Valley Press.

Rookie Trysten Hill building on 1st impression with Cowboys,"FRISCO, Texas (AP) — Trysten Hill spent part of his 21st birthday talking football with Dallas defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli, about a month before the Cowboys made the former Central Florida defender their first pick of the draft in the second round.

At the time, Hill was dealing with questions about his final season with the Golden Knights, when a coaching change resulted in the defensive tackle starting just one game after Hill was a full-time starter for two seasons under former coach Scott Frost.

Hill sold the no-nonsense Marinelli that night and in other conversations before the draft, and ultimately won over enough of the Dallas staff to get taken 58th overall by a team that didn't have a first-round pick because of a trade for receiver Amari Cooper last season.

Now it's time for Hill to build on that first impression, starting with rookie minicamp this weekend.

""I think that kind of got fueled the wrong way,"" Hill said of his relationship with the UCF staff under Josh Heupel, Frost's replacement following a 13-0 season in 2017. ""I know what it's like to be coached by all different types of coaches. The emotional coach and the demanding coach. I respond well to both.""

Hill, who showed displeasure with his playing time after a Fiesta Bowl loss to LSU that snapped UCF's 25-game winning streak, acknowledged that he could have handled the coaching transition better. But he said he went back to UCF after the draft and thanked the coaches for helping him mature and achieve his goal of reaching the NFL.

""I can't go back in the past and change that,"" Hill said. ""Ever since then I have gone back to UCF and talked and been able to go out to practice. I know having my roots at UCF is really important and I want to keep establishing that.""

Hill also said the coaching change helped him on the field, because of a switch to the 4-3 that gave the Cowboys a better glimpse of how the 308-pounder fits on the interior of their defensive line. He's a backup to three-year starter Maliek Collins — for now.

""It's unbelievable how hard he plays,"" Marinelli said. ""You'd be hard pressed to see any guy playing that hard at just about every position. It's just about every down, his motor is running. When you see that, that reflects football character.""

Owner Jerry Jones has no concerns about the rest of Hill's character, despite the mystery surrounding his junior season at UCF before Hill declared early for the draft.

""When you have a change in a coaching staff, especially if you have it at that critical juncture when you're getting ready to finish your college career, it's like losing a parent to some degree,"" Jones said. ""And that's quite an adjustment for anyone.""

Being a backup his final season at UCF didn't affect Hill's production. He had the best year of his college career, with three sacks and 10 1/2 tackles for loss. His 36 tackles also were his collegiate high.

""We're just a day into this, but certainly an impressive young man and that's one of the reasons we drafted him,"" coach Jason Garrett said. ""He's like all of them. We're trying to get to know them and they're trying to get to know what we want in every opportunity we have together.""

Hill is joining a defensive line led by DeMarcus Lawrence, who just signed a $105 million, five-year contract with the highest per-season average ($21 million) in club history. Robert Quinn, who had three seasons of double-digit sacks in his first four years, came in a trade with Miami.

Marinelli has high hopes that Hill can be a threat as a pass rusher from inside. The longtime coach considers that potential weapon the most important on his defense.

""I've always had a philosophy, you develop the man first and then you develop the player,"" Marinelli said. ""It's important to me that I help him become the man he wants to be. That usually happens through the work that we do. Then we've got to help him be a good player.""

Making an impression on Marinelli was important enough to Hill for him to spend a milestone birthday sitting at ""two little chairs pulled up to a table,"" talking drills and other football matters.

""That's the experience that I'm happy to look back at and say that I spent my 21st with my coach,"" Hill said.

It helped the Cowboys believe Hill was coachable.

"Hunt charged with murder, attempted murder X3 in Cove quadruple shooting","PANAMA CITY — Michael Hunt, the man initially sought as a ""person of interest"" in the April 4 quadruple shooting on Allen Avenue that left one woman dead and three people critically injured is now charged with first-degree murder and three counts of attempted felony murder, Panama City police announced shortly after 3 p.m. today.

Panama City police Friday afternoon announced the arrest of Hunt on a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Alexandra “Lexie” Elise Peck, 19. She was one of four people shot late April 4, with three surviving with critical injuries. Hunt is charged with attempted felony murder in each of those shootings. In addition, police have now also charged Hunt with armed burglary of a dwelling and two counts of failure to register as a sex offender.

Hunt has been in custody since April 5, one day after four people were shot in the 100 block of Allen Avenue. He was caught the day after the shooting but until today was charged with Human Trafficking and Sexual Assault from another case, as well as being held without bond for failure to appear on a charge of ""unlawful sex acts with certain minors"" and aggravated assault with a firearm. Hunt actually appeared for that hearing April 1, but disappeared after the prosecutor announced there was a new warrant out for him for sexual battery but a hard copy of it was not on hand.

Three days later the shootings occurred.

The Panama City Police Department has since been working with a bevy of agencies on the case - they maintained the crime scene for a week to gather evidence - which left many in the Cove area frightened and wondering what had actually happened, particularly after Hunt was picked up the day after the shootings but not charged with in connection with them until today.

Police have still released few details about the shootings and did not take any today after issuing the press release. They have said the case is of such a nature that public records laws do not apply to much of the information sought and prevents them from releasing certain details. They have also said the public has provided ""invaluable"" information to investigators.

Hunt, 53 is a registered sex offender, who was set for a hearing April 1 on a new sex charge from last fall. Hunt was at the hearing, but when confusion over a new sex charge brought the hearing to a temporary halt, Hunt was gone when court reconvened and the warrant for sexual battery had been found.

Courtroom video obtained by The News Herald shows Hunt and his appointed attorney at the time standing at one podium and the prosecutor at another.

As the hearing begins at 2:42 p.m., the prosecutor quickly tells the judge, “I believe Mr. Hunt has an active warrant. I was (unintelligible) this morning.”

“A what?” Hunt says, looking back toward the audience in the courtroom.

The judge can be heard a short time later saying, “Yeah, I’m not showing it in (unintelligible) but that doesn’t mean it’s not active.”

The prosecutor then is seen pulling up the information on her smartphone, saying, “A warrant for Michael Harrison Hunt, uh, for sexual battery on a victim under 18.”

Hunt at this point raises his left hand in what looks like a gesture of disbelief.

Hunt’s attorney tells the judge it’s likely just a continuation of the charge Hunt is in court for that day — for which his previously posted $65,000 bond was reduced to a release on his own recognizance bond in November by another judge. Hunt had made his court appearances since then.

“What’s your date of birth, Mr. Hunt?” the judge asks.

“6-1-65, your honor,” Hunt replies.

Using that as a comparison point, the prosecutor a short time later, again using her smartphone, says, “I have it right here” and says that the date of birth matches Hunt’s.

“Alright, well, I’m not going to take any action yet until I see an actual capias has been issued so I’ll wait and see what that is and maybe that will give a chance for Ms. Miron to get with (the prosecutor) to discuss that issue,” the judge says says.

Hunt remains standing by his attorney as the prosecutor asks if they can “just recall the case (when we’ve) sorted it out?”

“You can,” the judge replies. “Mr. Hunt, if you will take a seat and we’ll see if we can get to the bottom of this for you.”

“Yes sir,” Hunt replies, and he is seen walking out of camera range toward the audience, and the door, less than 2 minutes after the hearing started.

Forty-five minutes later the video picks back up with the court clerk calling, “The State recalls Michael Hunt.”

The judge asks Miron to get her client but less than a minute later her voice can be heard from beyond camera range, “It appears Mr. Hunt has vacated the courthouse.”

The judge immediately ruled that Hunt had failed to appear by leaving early and ordered him held without bond, making Hunt a wanted man. The search that ensued turned into an all-out manhunt three days later when four people were gunned down Thursday night in an Allen Avenue home.

Panama City police quickly declared Hunt a “person of interest” in the case and he was located the following evening and taken into custody for failure to appear, but he has not been charged in connection with the shootings.

Police have not said if they think the shootings are related to any of the previous or pending charges against Hunt or why he is a “person of interest” in the case. The scene of the crime remained roped off with crime scene tape Wednesday. In addition to the earlier charges, Hunt, now being held without bond, is facing new charges of human trafficking, living off the earnings of a prostitute and sexual battery no physical force by offender 18 or older, victim greater than 12 years of age/less than 18 years of age.

Hunt previously served prison time from April 3, 2013, until June 1, 2015, for three drug charges — including trafficking — as well as grand theft and living off the earnings of a prostitute, according to Florida Department of Corrections records. Those records also indicate Hunt “qualified” for sexual offender status for a 1990 conviction for “US MILITARY (RAPE) GCMO 16 Us Army, NJ.”

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s Sexual Offenders and Predators Search website shows that on Jan. 3, Hunt registered his address as being 2119 E. Fifth St., which is the address for Polecats, a business that advertises on social media as a “Dance Studio & VIP Event Venue.” On social media it appears to have a warehouse-type interior that includes a small stage and dance pole.

According to the Florida Department of State, Division of Corporations, Hunt is listed as the registered agent and manager of POLECATS LLC.

And according to the Bay County Property Appraiser’s Office, that property is owned by 6316 E INDEPENDENCE BLVD, LLC., which, in turn, according to the Division of Corporations, lists its title manager as George Kingston, who owns a number of other properties downtown and in Panama City.

Man guilty of attempted murder in shooting outside Ocala bar,"Steven Caro, 32, will be sentenced on May 23

Jurors on Friday found a man guilty of attempted second-degree murder in the shooting of a former U.S. Coast Guard member.

The six-member jury, all women, began deliberating at 11:38 a.m. and by 12:51 p.m. had reached a verdict. Seven minutes later, Circuit Judge Steven Rogers, who presided over the two-day trial, reviewed the verdict before giving it to the clerk to read aloud.

At the conclusion, the defendant, Steven Caro, 32, removed the gold chain from around his neck and gave it to his lawyer, James Tarquin.

Rogers scheduled sentencing for 2:30 p.m. May 23.

Before leaving the courtroom in handcuffs, Caro wanted to make a statement. Rogers told him he will have time to say something, and cautioned him to talk with his attorney first before saying anything.

But Caro insisted. He asked if the verdict could be appealed. Rogers told him Tarquin will explain the procedures to him. Caro also asked for a phone call.

Tarquin told the Star-Banner: ""We all did our jobs.""

Prosecutors Shaw Ashley and Cindy Harper spoke to the family of the victim, Jarel Rhem, who was a member of the U.S. Coast Guard. The prosecutors declined comment to the Star-Banner.

Rhem's father, Frank, said: ""We thank God for saving our son and we're pleased that justice was served.""

Rhem's mother, Kathleen, said: ""I'm happy we have our son."" She said while she's sorry for Caro's family, she's glad for the verdict because Caro won't hurt anyone else.

Earlier Friday, jurors listened intently during closing arguments as Harper told them that Caro was the man who shot and almost killed Rhem, now 24.

Harper said Caro was at Tavern on the Square, 11 E. Silver Springs Blvd., one night in May 2017 and bumped into Rhem on the dance floor. She said Rhem's friend, Yuan Carlos Huertas, intervened and separated the men.

She said Caro, who was wearing a distinctive red hat, ""stared them (Rhem and Huertas) down."" From there, Harper said, there were complaints made about Caro and his attitude.

When the club closed, she said, Rhem and Caro were face to face outside and Caro whispered something. As Rhem leaned in, there was a shot and Caro ran, getting into his vehicle and driving away.

""He shot that bullet into Jarel Rhem's stomach,"" Harper said.

Harper played an interview Caro gave to Ocala police Detective Jeff Hurst. At the time, the men, along with other detectives, were in a car on their way to the police department. Caro had been arrested for attempted second-degree murder.

In the interview, Caro talks about being at the club and having a brief confrontation with Rhem. He said he went outside and pulled out his knife. When he heard a shot he ran away. After that interview, Harper told the jury, other witnesses, including Huertas, identified Caro as the shooter.

During his closing argument, Tarquin said witnesses presented by the state gave conflicting testimony. The statements, he said, were different from what they said during depositions. That, he argues, ""shows reasonable doubt.""

Tarquin said that while he understands the difficultly of police work, in his estimation, their investigation was poor. He said police lost a photo lineup that was shown to one of the witnesses. Also, they did not record some of the witness statements and failed to send some evidence to be tested by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

""They didn't do their jobs,"" Tarquin said.

Tarquin noted that Rhem picked someone other than Caro from a photo lineup. The lawyer was skeptical of his client's statements to Hurst, and told the jury to ""view it cautiously.""

In her counter-argument, Harper said Caro's statements to Hurst should prove he was at the scene and that he shot the victim. As for the photo lineup shown to Rhem: She said he was in the hospital at the time, under medication, and could not speak. She said Huertas did pick Caro from a photo lineup shown to him.

Each side was given an hour to make their closing arguments. The prosecution went first, followed by the defense and then the prosecutors' rebuttal.

Rogers read prepared jury instructions to the jurors and they left the courtroom for lunch and deliberations.

At the start of Friday's proceedings, Tarquin began the defense by calling several people to the witness stand. Caro chose not to testify.

Here they are: 4 Ocala-area grads never missed a day,"Perfect attendance for 13 years

Through it all, from flu season to family emergencies, four Marion County seniors had perfect attendance for all 13 years of school.

Three Forest High School students and one from North Marion High School were honored by the School District for attending all 2,340 days of school from kindergarten through 12th grade.

The only time the students missed school was when the district canceled school for all students for a few days during hurricane seasons.

All four students graduate May 18 with the highest attendance rate in the district for the Class of 2019. Forest’s graduation is at 9 a.m. and North Marion High School’s is at 7 p.m. Both ceremonies wil be held at the Southeastern Livestock Pavilion on Old Jacksonville Road.

“That is awesome,” said Eric Cummings, the School Board’s vice chairman. “That means these children have fantastic family support.”

Board member Nancy Thrower was in awe of the accomplishment.

“That’s some kind of dedication,” she noted. “If they continue with that kind of commitment they will not have any problems with their next steps in life.”

Last year, just one student in the district reached this milestone.

Some compare the accomplishment of these four students to Cal Ripken Jr. of Major League Baseball. Ripken broke Lou Gehrig’s record of consecutive games played. Ripken, known by the nickname the “Iron Man,” played 2,632 consecutive games. That is the equivalent of more than 16 seasons without missing a game.

Marion’s “Iron Women,” listed in alphabetical order, are:

Hannah Farrow

Hannah started kindergarten in 2006 at Maplewood Elementary and continued to Howard Middle School and Forest.

She plans to continue her education at the College of Central Florida. Hannah is the daughter of Wayne and Kim Farrow of Ocala.

Amber Hanegan

Amber enrolled as a kindergarten student in 2006 at Reddick-Collier Elementary and advanced to North Marion Middle School and North Marion High.

She is considering studying business administration at Santa Fe College. Amber is the daughter of Christina Hanegan of Reddick.

Wasanti Sharma

Wasanti started kindergarten in 2006 at Madison Street Academy and advanced to Howard Middle School and Forest.

She plans to attend the University of Florida with an undeclared major. Wasanti is the daughter of Prem and Tommie Sharma of Ocala.

Jaylin Tomlin

Jaylin entered kindergarten at Maplewood Elementary in 2006 and continued to Shady Hill Elementary, Liberty Middle School and Forest.

"After addiction and loss, Seminole mother finds strength in family, customs and herself","Every time Dakota Osceola hit rock bottom, she had the will to get back up and a mom who stood by her with outstretched hands — no judgment, no shaming, no ultimatums.

Through years of Dakota’s drug addiction, rehab treatments, depression, the overdose deaths of her friends, relapses and unhealthy relationships, Tina Marie Osceola was there — a stable, determined force of tough love and support for her daughter regardless of the circumstances and decisions that led her girl down an agonizing path.

“There was no playbook to go by, other than the way I was raised by my own parents,” Osceola said. “I wanted Dakota to know that I would always be there, regardless of what the problem was. If your kid feels like you’re judging them, they’re going to think you think they’re a bad person. And they’re not going to come to you. They’re going to shut you out.”

Dakota Osceola and her daughter, Mia, walk down the driveway of their home in Naples on May 3, 2019. Many members of their family, including Dakota's mother, brother, and grandparents, live on the same street as Dakota and Mia. ""We have everything we need, and that's each other,"" she said. ""We're trying to be financially independent, trying our best to work as hard as we can to accomplish our goals, and that's really what it's been about since the beginning of the Osceolas."" (Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Osceola said she had to check herself frequently when figuring out how to help her daughter and how involved to get in Dakota’s life during her difficult periods.

In Osceola’s experience, giving tough love sometimes meant letting Dakota sit in jail when she was arrested, taking her to rehab centers again and again, telling her daughter what she needed to hear and letting her make her own mistakes while remaining vigilant.

Osceola said she’s a problem solver and a fixer. But she knew she couldn’t fix her daughter’s problems for her no matter how much she wanted to.

“It’s letting them fall,” Osceola said. “It’s the hardest thing a parent can do. But if you don’t let them hit their own version of rock bottom and let them get back up themselves, they’re not going to find that road to recovery.”

She left an abusive relationship and is a single mom to her 2-year-old daughter, Mia. She has become actively involved in her family’s Seminole culture, including causes related to indigenous women’s issues. She raises awareness about violence against women and raises money for the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center.

Dakota started a business selling traditional Seminole jewelry. She spends hours every day buried in beads, creating necklaces, bracelets and earrings in intricate color patterns. Dakota and her mom, who also beads, sell their creations on Seminole and Miccosukee reservations in South Florida and beyond.

“I’m really proud. It saved my life,” Dakota said of beading.

History of drug use

Dakota said she started partying and skipping class in high school. She said she started smoking marijuana when she was 16 years old. She eventually moved on to hallucinogens. Then Xanax.

“That was my first time getting to the point where I wasn’t remembering giant blocks of time,” she said.

In 2012, when Dakota was 18, Collier County Sheriff’s deputies arrested her at her mom’s house on charges of possession of alcohol by a minor, marijuana and drug paraphernalia. She was arrested again soon after being released from the Collier jail on another marijuana possession charge.

Osceola was out of town a lot because of her job with the Seminole Tribe of Florida. She’s currently a tribal judge and worked at the Sheriff’s Office from 1995 to 2004.

Osceola said it felt like she blinked and things changed with her daughter. She can’t remember when the transition happened.

“I was on the road a lot, and so I think that’s why it seemed like it happened so fast…,” she said.

Dakota’s drug use became an emergency for Osceola, and she wanted it to be everybody else’s emergency, too. When Osceola needed help for herself and her daughter, she turned to her tribe and her former coworkers at the Sheriff’s Office. They became her extended support network. She reached out to whatever resources she could find.

“I didn’t care if they arrested her. That was fine,” Osceola said. “Jail, institutions or death, and I’ll choose jail. I’ll choose an institution for my daughter. Who wants to choose death?”

Dakota was always open about her struggles, her mom said. She’s unapologetically herself and was brutally honest about her addiction. It was never a secret, but it was still difficult for Osceola to accept.

“I’m the one who had to tell myself the truth about what was really going on most of the time,” Osceola said. “I had to be brave enough to start asking questions. And that’s not easy when you know your child will tell you the truth. That’s the ground floor of denial, not knowing and not being brave enough to even ask the questions.”

Dakota’s first rehab treatment began days after her 2012 arrest. She stayed at a treatment center for about 100 days, she said.

“It gave me a dose of independence and really showed me what life could be,” Dakota said.

Her sobriety didn’t last long when she got back home. She had more rehab stints between 2013 and 2015. A series of traumatic losses compounded her struggle.

One friend died in a motorcycle crash. Others died of overdoses. A guy she was dating died of an overdose in March 2015, one day after the pair went looking for apartments to move into together.

“ … My drug use went off the charts after that happened,” Dakota said. “I was self-medicating not to feel that pain.”

Dakota’s mom took her to a rehab center in Tampa three days later.

“After that I was like, you know what? This is the reality of it: You can either die, go to jail, or be institutionalized for the rest of your life because you did some pretty bad harm to yourself,” Dakota said. “I didn’t take it seriously before that.”

Beading, beading, beading

Dakota believes beautiful things can come from terrible situations.

Everything she has gone through, she said, was meant to happen to bring better things into her life. She feels that way about her beadwork and her daughter.

In 2015, during one of their weekly phone calls when she was at the Tampa center, Dakota asked her mom to bring her plastic bin full of beads.

Osceola visited a bead store in Naples and bought pliers and wire. She stuffed Dakota’s bead bin with everything she would need and delivered it to her.

Dakota grew up in a house full of beads. When she was little, she sat in her family’s booths at various reservations while they sold their art.

Her mom has had a massive collection since she was a kid, and when Dakota was about 5 years old, she started collecting her own.

Osceola grew up in Naples but lived within her tribal culture. Her life was all about her family and the traditional art they made and sold so they could pay the bills. Her aunts and cousins sew Seminole patchwork “like no one’s business,” and her dad makes jewelry. Osceola learned how to weave baskets, make dolls and sew, though she said she was a failure as a seamstress. Osceola and her dad also have a beading business together.

“Beading was my thing,” Osceola said.

(Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

And it’s become her daughter’s thing. Making traditional art for survival took on a different meaning for Dakota. She didn’t need to make jewelry to support a family, pay bills or put herself through school; she needed it to work through her struggles.

The day Dakota picked up her beads at the rehab facility became her first day of healing.

“I was like: Wow, I really love this. This is what’s gonna keep me sober,” Dakota said. “This is what’s gonna keep me clean. This is what’s gonna give me purpose.”

Dakota began thriving. She made jewelry for her friends in rehab and taught some of them how to bead. When she left the center, she got a booth at a market in Ybor City near downtown Tampa and sold countless pieces.

“You know, that independence and the ability to set goals for herself, and to know that she did it and it was 100 percent her effort … that did more than anything toward her sobriety,” Osceola said.

Finding peace

Dakota had another major obstacle to overcome before she found her peace.

She said she was in an abusive relationship with her daughter’s father. Dakota said he was physically abusive before she became pregnant and he didn’t stop after. The man was arrested on a domestic battery charge in late 2015 after hitting Dakota in the face, court records show.

Dakota said she was on the phone with her mom when her ex hit her, and she told her mom what happened.

Looking back on that day, Dakota’s mom said her daughter’s life sometimes felt like she was walking back through some of her own experiences.

“I had to get past an emotional reaction and wanting to be the mom that picks up a stick, goes out and beats the crap out of somebody to rational thought,” Osceola said.

She had to think to herself: What tools have I learned along the way?

Osceola said she experienced a years-long abusive relationship when she was in college. She said she thought the abuse was her fault at the time, that she must have done something to deserve it. She stayed for five years, and it was five years too long, she said.

Osceola knows her daughter. She knows telling Dakota what to do doesn’t work, because being told what to do didn’t work for Osceola, either. Osceola checked herself again.

She believed in allowing her daughter to make her own mistakes before. To reach rock bottom so she could get back up. But Dakota had only been in recovery for a few months. She wasn’t on solid ground just yet.

“I knew this was something that could push her over the edge,” Osceola said.

This was not a rock bottom she would let her daughter reach.

Osceola put her foot down in her own way. She told Dakota she couldn’t let the man do that to her and asked her daughter to let her call the Sheriff’s Office.

The man was arrested. He was adjudicated guilty in 2016 and sentenced to a year in the county jail with credit for time served, followed by three years of state probation.

Dakota said she tried to work things out with him when he was released from the jail. She knew immediately it wouldn’t work out. She said she thinks he would have become violent again.

“I didn’t want that around my child,” she said.

Dakota moved back to Naples after the incident. She had her family’s support throughout her pregnancy and in the two years since she had Mia.

Dakota said she now feels like she’s in a good place — in her home, her work and motherhood.

“My daughter’s happy,” Dakota said. “She loves this space, she loves our house, she loves coming home. And that’s where I wanna be. This is where I’m happy.”

It takes a tribe

Dakota said her mom and grandparents have given her everything she needs emotionally and mentally.

She and her mom get their strength from their family, their culture and their moments of darkness.

When Dakota was using drugs, and even when she wasn’t, her mom was always there to pick her up and come up with solutions to whatever she was going through. Her grandma was there to make her feel warm and loved. Her grandma made her feel like she was something special.

Dakota and her mom said they also derive their strength from what it means to be indigenous women: community-oriented, strong, loving, accepting. Warriors.

Since Dakota started selling her jewelry on reservations, she has opened herself up to people and made lasting friendships with other indigenous women. They support each other’s businesses and talk about their traditional arts and preserving culture.

“We all try to empower each other,” Dakota said. “We show up for each other and have our own economy.”

The strength, rich culture and power that Dakota’s family has passed on to her is something she wants to pass on to Mia.

Dakota’s mom was driven to work, be financially independent, support her family and be involved in tribal issues locally and nationally. Now Dakota is at a stage in which she values her business, financial independence, providing for her daughter and being involved in her community.

Everything the Osceolas do they do together, for each other, and with the help of their family.

She’s raising Mia with a secure, united family. Dakota likes to say her mom is a badass, and that she’s lucky to be a mom to a little girl she knows is going to turn out the same way.

“I want Mia to be unapologetically herself, no matter how weird or silly that may be,” Dakota said. “To treat people how she wants to be treated and never settle for anybody less than what her family can provide for her.”

Dakota has a lot of hope — for her daughter, herself, her business, her future.

That hope came from surviving her addictions and finding her power through family background. She said she has lost the desire to use drugs. While she feels like a weight has been lifted off her shoulders, she works on herself and her mental health regularly and makes sure she maintains a healthy, balanced lifestyle.

(Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

Dakota’s mom said addiction runs in their family. And substance abuse issues affect indigenous populations in general. Osceola has worried about history repeating itself, but she believes in Dakota and her commitment to her sobriety.

“I think a lot of people in our society look at addiction as a weakness instead of a source of strength,” Osceola said. “That’s not our weakness. The battles native people have gone through, it’s not our weakness. It’s our strength that we survived.”

During that final stint in rehab, Dakota willed herself to get back up. Her survival is inextricably linked to the strength she gets from her family.

“We have everything we need, and that’s each other,” Dakota said.

"Indiantown man jailed on molestation charge, also accused of battery on 5-year-old","Hermenegildo Salvador-Lopez (Photo: MARTIN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE)

INDIANTOWN — An Indiantown man is accused of sexually battering a 5-year-old girl multiple times and molesting a 13-year-old girl, sheriff's deputies said.

Hermenegildo Salvador-Lopez, 27, of the 14500 block of Southwest Martin Avenue in Indiantown, was charged Thursday with sexually battering the 5-year-old.

Salvador-Lopez was already in the Martin County Jail prior to Thursday's charge. He was arrested in April on a charge of lewd and lascivious molestation on a child younger than 16 from an incident that happened in October, deputies said.

Martin County sheriff's deputies said in April the girl, who is now 16, told deputies Salvador-Lopez had touched her inappropriately multiple times when she was younger.

""It's something that I have to live with,"" the girl told deputies when talking about what Salvador-Lopez had done.

The 16-year-old also told deputies the touching continued until she was 12. At that time, she kicked him and threatened to tell her mother.

The 16-year-old told deputies Salvador-Lopez told her no one would believe her and that God would blame her for letting this happen.

The other teen told deputies Salvador-Lopez touched her inappropriately and refused to stop when she asked him.

Salvador-Lopez remained in the Martin County Jail with a $550,500 bond.

Florida man Randy Herman Jr. gets life for slaying he blamed on sleepwalking,"Randy Herman Jr., 26, received a life sentence in the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Brooke Preston on March 25, 2017.

WEST PALM BEACH — After about five hours of deliberations, a 12-person jury found Randy Herman Jr. guilty of first-degree murder Wednesday in the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Brooke Preston in 2017, rejecting the defense that he was sleepwalking when he attacked her in suburban West Palm Beach.

After the verdict was read, both Preston's family and Herman's family teared up silently on opposite sides of the courtroom as Circuit Judge John Kastrenakes thanked the jury for its service of more than a week in the case. Before the judge sentenced Herman, 26, to the mandatory term of life in prison, Preston's sister, Jordan, spoke briefly before the court.

As she tried to stifle her tears, she explained nothing has been the same since her sister was killed. The sisters and Herman had know each other since they were teenagers and lived together for more than six months at the home where she was attacked. Jordan Preston was not in the residence at the time of the fatal stabbing.

""The last few years without her have been awful. Our lives are totally different,"" she said.

Outside the courtroom, Preston's father, John, walked surrounded by more than a dozen family members and friends who came down from Pennsylvania for the trial.

""There's no winners in this whole situation. Everybody's losers,"" he said.

Herman and his lawyers had argued he was sleepwalking when he stabbed Preston more than 20 times on the morning of March 25, 2017, and should be found not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors told the jury Herman's actions were deliberate and not the product of an alleged sleepwalking episode.

Investigators said Preston had finished packing up and was ready to move to New York when Herman sent her a text message, asking her to pick up a shirt before she left to give to a friend. When Herman testified last week, he said he thought Preston had come back to the house that morning, he had given her a shirt, then they had hugged goodbye, she left and he went back to sleep.

“The next thing (I know), I’m standing over top of her and I have a knife in my hand, covered in blood,” Herman said. “I was confused. Scared. Didn’t know what to do. Didn’t know what happened.”

Herman then drove to a nearby park, called 911 and told them that even though he didn't remember what had happened, he said he must have been the one that killed Preston because no one else was home.

Over the course of the trial, which began with testimony April 30, the jury heard from Palm Beach County sheriff's detectives; Herman; Jordan Preston; Kyle McGregor, the man who last saw Preston alive; as well as from experts who testified both for against the sleepwalking defense.

In his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant Public Defender Joseph Walsh said there was no logical answer to what happened. There was no motive, no history of violence and no issues between Herman and Preston.

“There is no other rational explanation for this killing other than this could have been sleepwalking,"" Walsh said.

Dr. Charles Patrick Ewing, a forensic psychologist, testified Monday that he was ""truly puzzled"" by the case until he learned of Herman's history of sleepwalking.

“That really made sense to me, because I really couldn’t make any other sense of the case,” Ewing said.

He said while sleepwalking is uncommon and sleepwalking homicides are even less likely, they do happen and Herman met the criteria: The person attacked was well-loved by the attacker, there appeared to be no motive in the case, Herman said he couldn't remember anything from the attack and he had a history of sleepwalking.

Herman's mother, Kathi Adams, testified that she had witnessed several episodes as Herman was a child, but Jordan Preston said in the years she had known him and lived with him, she never saw him sleepwalk.

On Tuesday, prosecutors had Dr. Wade C. Myers, a forensic psychiatrist, testify and say that there's no way Herman could have slept through the 20-plus stabs he inflicted on Preston because it was too complex of an action.

Instead, he suggested the motive in the killing may be sexually based, drawing from an alleged incident the night before the stabbing where Herman reportedly hid in Brooke Preston's closet naked after a day of drinking heavily. No one saw the alleged incident and it was only known because Preston reportedly told McGregor and asked to spend the night with him.

Preston's sister testified that there was no sexual or romantic interest between herself, her sister or Herman.

Over the years, there have been several high-profile murder cases where those accused have claimed sleepwalking as a defense for their actions and have had their juries rule both for and against them.

In 2015, Joseph Mitchell was found not guilty of strangling his 4-year-old son to death after his attorneys argued he was sleepwalking at the time of the attack in North Carolina. In 1999, an Arizona man was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of his wife after he claimed he was sleepwalking when he stabbed her and then dragged her to the pool and held her head under water.

During his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant State Attorney Reid Scott said Herman was not sleepwalking and that he knew what he was doing.

""This is skin, this is bone, this is muscle (he's stabbing,)"" he said. ""You're not going to sleepwalk through that.""",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190509/florida-man-randy-herman-jr-gets-life-for-slaying-he-blamed-on-sleepwalking?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T10:00:53Z,The Ledger,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA"
Swan City showcases City Beautiful through T-shirts,"ORLANDO, Fla. - Swan City is letting the world know there is more to Orlando than just theme parks and tourism.

The online apparel store features Orlando-inspired designs, showcasing some of the local hidden gems the City Beautiful has to offer. A Central Florida man is using his T-shirts as a creative way to display what Orlando really has to offer.

""I love this place. I don't think I'll ever leave now,"" Andrew Chang, founder of Swan City said.

But the 30-year-old didn’t always feel this way.

""Coming here, I thought this wasn't a big city. I thought this wasn't big enough for me. I didn't think there was enough things to do,"" Chang said.

In 2008, he moved from his hometown, Titusville, to go to school at the University of Central Florida. A year later, he met his husband.

Together, they started to venture out into hot spots in Orlando and realized all the things it has to offer -- away from the tourism.

""We started getting things like the soccer stadium and the performing arts center and a lot more growth and development in the downtown area,"" Chang said.

The entrepreneur said those changes in the city started to give Orlando a different identity -- one he wanted everyone to experience -- so he created Swan City.

The online apparel store is where he honors the City Beautiful through T-shirts with a touch of his humor. Some of the shirts depict a well-known building that can be see from a popular highway, one locals call part of Orlando’s landscape.

""If anyone recognizes the building, we know it in Orlando as the I-4 eyesore,” he said. “It's taken, I think, 17 years to get to where it's at.”

Also showcased is a popular pizza restaurant, Lazy Moon. It’s a staple of the UCF community.

""Going to UCF, this is a very popular place back then -- and now since then, they've moved to downtown so it will workout for Lazy Moon,” Chang said. “If anyone knows about Lazy Moon, the slice is about the size of your face.”.

The company also pays tribute to the city's sports teams. Featuring designs on candles and posters, too.

It's places like the Milk District in east Orlando, Pom Pom's Teahouse and Sandwicheria or the Lake Eola and Thornton Park neighborhoods that Chang hopes outsiders will learn to love just as much as he does.

“I want people to understand that we have culture, we have identity, we have food and we have space for everyone. That everyone can feel safe and feel welcomed,” Chang said.

“I wanted everyone else to realize that this place is their home and that they should be prideful of living in Orlando.""

In 2016, Manning pleaded no contest to oral copulation of a person under 14, possession of more than 600 images of child and youth pornography and two counts of solicitation of a minor to engage in the preparation of sexual images, police said.

He was supposed to be sentenced Oct. 6, 2016, but he never made it to court. A car rented in his name was found a day after the scheduled hearing by National Park Service officers near the Golden Gate Bridge, along with a suicide note. Manning's body was never found, which raised suspicions.

“Investigators began to monitor the behavior and patterns of a close associate of Manning and observed what appeared to be sophisticated counter-surveillance measures,” according to the news release.

Deputies identify man wanted for dragging dog behind truck in Florida,"- Investigators have identified a man wanted for dragging a dog behind his truck down a roadway in Spring Hill last week.

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office said they are looking for 58-year-old Gregory Tousignant, who has a warrant out for his arrest for a misdemeanor charge of animal cruelty.

The incident happened Wednesday, May 1, when witnesses saw a young pit bull mix being dragged behind the pickup truck by a piece of rope attached to his collar.

Witnesses told deputies it appeared that Tousignant was unaware the dog had jumped out of the bed of his truck. The dog had been tied to the truck's bumper and came free from the collar when the truck made a turn.

The sheriff's office said it is illegal to carry any pet in the bed of a truck that is not properly secured and prevented from jumping out of the moving vehicle.

The 1-year-old dog was brought to a Weeki Wachee animal clinic for treatment.

Because Tousignant is homeless, deputies are asking for the public's help to find him. Anyone with information on his whereabouts is asked to call the sheriff's office at 352-754-6830.",http://www.fox5dc.com/news/deputies-identify-man-wanted-for-dragging-dog-behind-truck-in-hernando-county,2019-05-08T20:42:03Z,FOX 5 DC,"5151 Wisconsin Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016, USA"
Man's dying wish is to find forever homes for 11 rescue dogs,"A Texas man who doesn’t have long to live has one last wish before he dies: to find loving forever homes for nearly a dozen dogs he’s taken in over the years.

Richard Ewers, 71, is living out his remaining days in hospice care since he was given a week to live after being diagnosed with cancer, according to San Antonio’s KSAT-TV.

Two years ago, Ewers began rescuing strays and other dogs that had been discarded by their owners, and taking care of them at his home, the television station reports.

Even before his diagnosis, Ewers couldn’t do it alone. So volunteers have pitched in by getting the dogs vaccinated, spayed and neutered, and helping to find them new homes.

Now that the 71-year-old is in hospice, Save Our Strays San Antonio has been visiting his home to make sure the dogs are well fed, watered and looked after in Ewers’ absence.

“There’s no one to give them attention and love. There is no running water. There is no electricity. The conditions are just not ideal,” volunteer Mary Oyler told KSAT.

Oyler said Ewers’ dying wish is to make sure each of the remaining 11 dogs is placed into a new home where they can get all the love and care they need to thrive.

“There's a lot of work involved,” Oyler said. “All they've ever known is Mr. Richard, so it's going to require a family that has a lot of patience.”

Anyone interested in adopting one of the dogs – whose names include Billie Sue, Fuzzy, Lady, Lucky, Sugar and Skipper, to name a few – can visit the Facebook page Helping Mr. Richard and his dogs.

“We are very sad by this, of course, and we want to make that last wish come true for him,” Oyler said.

Starbucks' past incidents of racial discrimination makes its way to Brandon,"MORE ABOUT THE LAWSUIT Man claims he was harassed by Starbucks employees in Brandon

TAMPA, Fla. - A new lawsuit has been filed against a Brandon Starbucks, citing racial discrimination, but it's not the first time the coffee giant has been in hot water.

Last year, two African-American men were arrested for tresspassing while waiting for a friend at a Starbucks in downtown Philadelphia, after an employee refused to allow him to use the restroom, saying it was for paying customers only.

Days later, another viral video surfaced showing an African-American man in the Los Angeles area trying to show that he was denied use of a Starbucks restroom while a white customer was allowed access.

The series of incidents prompted Starbucks to show its 175,000 employees a film about racial bias to lead into a full curriculum on the topic.

In May of 2018, more than 8,000 Starbucks locations, including more than 20 in Hillsborough County, closed for training on the subject of racial bias.

Starbucks later update it's policies, saying anyone could sit in its cafes or use its restrooms, even if they didn't buy anything.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Florida law protects anyone from discrimination based on virtually any personal factors:

""All persons are entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, handicap, familial status, or religion.""

While most lawsuits pertaining to race discrimination stem from employment or racial bias in the workplace, Florida has had seven major lawsuits involving racial discrimnation in the laws ten years ranging from everything to stop-and-frisk situations in Miami to violating the rights of minority voters.

"Pensacola suspect in toddler 'torture' case has died, officials say","A Pensacola man accused of inflicting ""systematic torture"" on a toddler is deceased, according to officials.

Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius, 37, passed away in the hospital Tuesday afternoon, according to an Escambia County spokesperson. He was hospitalized May 1, the same day the Escambia County Sheriff's Office announced Celaius was charged with committing ""heinous"" acts of abuse against his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter.

Celaius was in custody at Escambia County Jail at the time he was hospitalized. County officials, citing patient privacy laws, have declined to discuss what caused his hospitalization and his subsequent death.

Allegations of torture: In wolf mask and Batman PJs, Pensacola man tortured child for cameras, report says

Celaius was initially booked into Escambia County Jail April 9 on drug charges, but on May 1, the Escambia County Sheriff's Office announced Celaius was facing new charges related to child abuse.

His arrest report alleges that Celaius had routinely abused the child over a two months span by throwing objects at her as she slept, shooting her in the head repeatedly with a BB gun and jolting her with an electric dog collar. He allegedly recorded the device on home surveillance cameras and personal cell phones.

According to an arrest report, a forensic exam of the victim raised concerns that she may have been sexually abused as well.

Jail personnel moved Celaius into protective custody immediately after the press conference announcing his child abuse charges, but a few hours later he was transported to a local hospital. County officials said he remained in the hospital until his death Tuesday.

A county spokesperson said the incident was being investigated both internally by the county and externally by the Escambia County Sheriff's Office.

Florida man arrested for refusing to remove vulgar bumper sticker: 'They're just words',"- A Florida man who was jailed after refusing to remove what authorities called an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window said Tuesday that he is fighting the charges and will defend his constitutional right to free speech.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence, a Columbia County Sheriff's Office report said.

Webb told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he plans to file a wrongful arrest lawsuit against the sheriff's office.

""I'm tired of police forces thinking they are above the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,"" Webb said.

A deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a vehicle sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite, the sheriff's report said. When told about the reason for the stop, Webb reportedly said, ""They're just words.""

Wedd said the deputy seemed angry from the start of the traffic stop.

""Like the whole time, he was just really rude,"" Webb told the AP. ""It just felt to me like his goal was to get me in jail.""

The deputy said he asked Webb how a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words, and Webb said that ""it would be up to the parent.""

Webb told the AP that he didn't imagine the sticker doing any serious damage to children.

""I've had parents drive by me with their kids taking pictures,"" Web said. ""They point and laugh and giggle, and they go on about their day.""

Webb said he had the sticker on his truck for less than a week before his traffic stop. He said he and several friends had all decided to get similar stickers as a group joke.

""I guess this cop just didn't find it funny, and he just thought he has to put me in jail,"" Webb said.

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court, the report said. The deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused.

""I said I'm not removing any letters on my sticker because that's in violation of my First Amendment rights as a tax-paying citizen,"" Webb said.

The deputy then charged Webb with resisting and took him to jail. Webb was released several hours later on $2,500 bond.

Webb's vehicle had been towed when he was arrested. He said the sticker was still in place when he retrieved the vehicle.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida released a statement Tuesday questioning why the sheriff's office was wasting resources on such a traffic stop.

""Shouldn't police officers spend their time serving and protecting communities and not pulling Floridians over for speech that is already protected by the First Amendment?"" ACLU spokeswoman Casey Bruce-White said in a statement. ""Using the excuse that a child would see and ask questions about this particular bumper sticker is absurd.""

The sheriff's office told the AP that deputy had probable cause of a violation of criminal law and took action. ""If the law is faulty then the legislature can address that or if the law is unconstitutional then the judiciary will address it, Sgt. Murray Smith said, adding that the defendant will have his day in court.

Webb said he wasn't even aware of the state's obscenity law, but after reviewing it since his arrest, he said it needs to be changed. He acknowledged that his sticker could be considered vulgar by some, but the law doesn't really define what that is.

""What's vulgar to me might not be vulgar to somebody else,"" Webb said.

Florida Man Faces Obscenity Charges For 'I Eat A**' Window Sticker,"A Florida man facing obscenity charges for having an “I eat ass” window sticker on his pickup truck finds his arrest a little hard to swallow.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was arrested Sunday afternoon in Lake City after a Columbia County sheriff’s deputy saw the message on the rear window of the vehicle.

When the officer pulled Webb over, he claimed the sticker violated a Florida statute dealing with the possession and distribution of obscene material, according to the Lake City Reporter.

Webb disagreed, saying the message was “just words.”

That prompted the deputy to ask Webb how “a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words,” to which Webb replied that it would be “up to the parent,” according to a police report obtained by The Smoking Gun.

The deputy then gave Webb a notice to appear at the Columbia County Courthouse on May 23 and took a photo of the offending sticker as evidence.

But when the deputy asked Webb to remove one of the letters from the word “ass” so the statement on the sticker would “no longer be derogatory,” the suspect refused, citing his First Amendment rights, according to the report.

Webb was then charged with resisting and taken to jail, only to be released several hours later on $2,500 bond, according to The Associated Press.

The truck was towed, but Webb said the sticker was still in place when he retrieved the vehicle from the impound lot.

Webb now plans to file a wrongful arrest lawsuit against the sheriff’s office.

“I’m tired of police forces thinking they are above the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,” Webb told the AP, adding that he seriously doubted any kids would suffer as a result of seeing his raunchy window sticker.

“I’ve had parents drive by me with their kids taking pictures. They point and laugh and giggle, and they go on about their day,” he said.

Webb said he put the sticker on the truck less than a week before his arrest as a group joke with several other friends.

“I guess this cop just didn’t find it funny, and he just thought he has to put me in jail,” Webb said.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida released a statement Tuesday questioning the deputy’s sticker stop.

“Shouldn’t police officers spend their time serving and protecting communities and not pulling Floridians over for speech that is already protected by the First Amendment?” ACLU spokeswoman Casey Bruce-White said in a statement. “Using the excuse that a child would see and ask questions about this particular bumper sticker is absurd.”

Columbia County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Sgt. Murray Smith told the AP that the deputy had probable cause at the time of the arrest, and that if the law is faulty, it’s up to the Legislature to address it or the judiciary to declare it unconstitutional.

Webb conceded that some people might find his sticker vulgar, but that the existing law doesn’t provide a clear definition.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dillon-shane-webb-i-eat-ass-obscenity-arrest_n_5cd2f5c6e4b0e524a47e4024,2019-05-08T12:58:35Z,HuffPost,"770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, USA"

Drunk Florida Man Crashes Riding Lawnmower Into Police Cruiser: Cops,"A Florida man is facing DUI charges after authorities say he was ""heavily intoxicated"" when he crashed a riding lawnmower into a police cruiser.

Gary Wayne Anderson, 68, was arrested Saturday night following the crash in Haines City, near Tampa, according to WFLA.

Police said the officer was inside a store when he heard a loud noise come from where his cruiser was parked. When he walked outside, he spotted Anderson on a lawnmower with an attached trailer and his cruiser's rear bumper was damaged.

Anderson couldn't complete field sobriety tests and the officer wrote in an arrest report that his demeanor ""ranged from laughing to aggressive."" He also claimed he had been poisoned by police, officials said.

Officers took Anderson to a nearby hospital where he gave a breathalyzer sample, which determined his blood-alcohol level was .241, more than three times the legal limit in Florida, the report said.

Anderson also had cocaine in his system, but accused police of putting it in his system, the report said. During his arrest Anderson was ""directing profane language and racial slurs at the officer,"" the report said.

"Hunt charged with murder, attempted murder X3 in Cove quadruple shooting","PANAMA CITY — Michael Hunt, the man initially sought as a ""person of interest"" in the April 4 quadruple shooting on Allen Avenue that left one woman dead and three people critically injured is now charged with first-degree murder and three counts of attempted felony murder, Panama City police announced shortly after 3 p.m. today.

Panama City police Friday afternoon announced the arrest of Hunt on a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Alexandra “Lexie” Elise Peck, 19. She was one of four people shot late April 4, with three surviving with critical injuries. Hunt is charged with attempted felony murder in each of those shootings. In addition, police have now also charged Hunt with armed burglary of a dwelling and two counts of failure to register as a sex offender.

Hunt has been in custody since April 5, one day after four people were shot in the 100 block of Allen Avenue. He was caught the day after the shooting but until today was charged with Human Trafficking and Sexual Assault from another case, as well as being held without bond for failure to appear on a charge of ""unlawful sex acts with certain minors"" and aggravated assault with a firearm. Hunt actually appeared for that hearing April 1, but disappeared after the prosecutor announced there was a new warrant out for him for sexual battery but a hard copy of it was not on hand.

Three days later the shootings occurred.

The Panama City Police Department has since been working with a bevy of agencies on the case - they maintained the crime scene for a week to gather evidence - which left many in the Cove area frightened and wondering what had actually happened, particularly after Hunt was picked up the day after the shootings but not charged with in connection with them until today.

Police have still released few details about the shootings and did not take any today after issuing the press release. They have said the case is of such a nature that public records laws do not apply to much of the information sought and prevents them from releasing certain details. They have also said the public has provided ""invaluable"" information to investigators.

Hunt, 53 is a registered sex offender, who was set for a hearing April 1 on a new sex charge from last fall. Hunt was at the hearing, but when confusion over a new sex charge brought the hearing to a temporary halt, Hunt was gone when court reconvened and the warrant for sexual battery had been found.

Courtroom video obtained by The News Herald shows Hunt and his appointed attorney at the time standing at one podium and the prosecutor at another.

As the hearing begins at 2:42 p.m., the prosecutor quickly tells the judge, “I believe Mr. Hunt has an active warrant. I was (unintelligible) this morning.”

“A what?” Hunt says, looking back toward the audience in the courtroom.

The judge can be heard a short time later saying, “Yeah, I’m not showing it in (unintelligible) but that doesn’t mean it’s not active.”

The prosecutor then is seen pulling up the information on her smartphone, saying, “A warrant for Michael Harrison Hunt, uh, for sexual battery on a victim under 18.”

Hunt at this point raises his left hand in what looks like a gesture of disbelief.

Hunt’s attorney tells the judge it’s likely just a continuation of the charge Hunt is in court for that day — for which his previously posted $65,000 bond was reduced to a release on his own recognizance bond in November by another judge. Hunt had made his court appearances since then.

“What’s your date of birth, Mr. Hunt?” the judge asks.

“6-1-65, your honor,” Hunt replies.

Using that as a comparison point, the prosecutor a short time later, again using her smartphone, says, “I have it right here” and says that the date of birth matches Hunt’s.

“Alright, well, I’m not going to take any action yet until I see an actual capias has been issued so I’ll wait and see what that is and maybe that will give a chance for Ms. Miron to get with (the prosecutor) to discuss that issue,” the judge says says.

Hunt remains standing by his attorney as the prosecutor asks if they can “just recall the case (when we’ve) sorted it out?”

“You can,” the judge replies. “Mr. Hunt, if you will take a seat and we’ll see if we can get to the bottom of this for you.”

“Yes sir,” Hunt replies, and he is seen walking out of camera range toward the audience, and the door, less than 2 minutes after the hearing started.

Forty-five minutes later the video picks back up with the court clerk calling, “The State recalls Michael Hunt.”

The judge asks Miron to get her client but less than a minute later her voice can be heard from beyond camera range, “It appears Mr. Hunt has vacated the courthouse.”

The judge immediately ruled that Hunt had failed to appear by leaving early and ordered him held without bond, making Hunt a wanted man. The search that ensued turned into an all-out manhunt three days later when four people were gunned down Thursday night in an Allen Avenue home.

Panama City police quickly declared Hunt a “person of interest” in the case and he was located the following evening and taken into custody for failure to appear, but he has not been charged in connection with the shootings.

Police have not said if they think the shootings are related to any of the previous or pending charges against Hunt or why he is a “person of interest” in the case. The scene of the crime remained roped off with crime scene tape Wednesday. In addition to the earlier charges, Hunt, now being held without bond, is facing new charges of human trafficking, living off the earnings of a prostitute and sexual battery no physical force by offender 18 or older, victim greater than 12 years of age/less than 18 years of age.

Hunt previously served prison time from April 3, 2013, until June 1, 2015, for three drug charges — including trafficking — as well as grand theft and living off the earnings of a prostitute, according to Florida Department of Corrections records. Those records also indicate Hunt “qualified” for sexual offender status for a 1990 conviction for “US MILITARY (RAPE) GCMO 16 Us Army, NJ.”

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s Sexual Offenders and Predators Search website shows that on Jan. 3, Hunt registered his address as being 2119 E. Fifth St., which is the address for Polecats, a business that advertises on social media as a “Dance Studio & VIP Event Venue.” On social media it appears to have a warehouse-type interior that includes a small stage and dance pole.

According to the Florida Department of State, Division of Corporations, Hunt is listed as the registered agent and manager of POLECATS LLC.

"Naples Zoo celebrates 50th year as a zoo, 100th year as a garden","In Naples, 100th birthdays aren't necessarily uncommon, but they're none the less a cause for celebration, which is exactly what the Naples Zoo is doing as it marks its 100th year as a botanical garden and 50th year as a zoo.

The zoo is hosting a birthday party Saturday for Dr. Henry Nehrling, the man without whom the zoo might not exist today.

Two men with a vision (and green thumbs)

Nehrling, a botanist from Wisconsin, moved to Central Florida in the early 1900s to study and collect tropical plants. A freeze devastated his garden in 1917, so in 1919 he moved further south to Naples and purchased 13 acres along the Gordon River.

His work thrived there and by 1925 Nehrling's collection had more than 3,000 species of tropical plants. He also helped introduce more than 300 new and beneficial plants to the United States.

Nehrling died in 1929 and for the next two decades his garden went unattended, said Tim Tetzlaff, the zoo's director of conservation.

""Basically nobody was keeping watch, nobody was paying attention, so there was a fair amount of botanical vandalism and stealing. Things that were either small enough or still in pots at the time kind of vanished,"" he said. ""That’s why we’ve got dozens of historic specimens, not thousands from that era.""

Julius Fleischmann, Jr., a philanthropist from Cincinnati, came to town in 1946 ""with his checkbook and a vision,"" Tetzlaff said. He bought Nehrling's property in 1951 and not only restored the garden to its former glory, but also expanded it.

""He added 30 more acres and also hundreds of species of birds,"" said Elaine Reed, president of Naples Historical Society. ""At one point he actually had 1,200 different species of birds.""

Fleischmann renamed the property ""Caribbean Gardens,"" a name it still bears today, and opened it to guests in 1954. Three years later he installed the famed toucan sign on U.S. 41 that welcomed visitors to the garden a few blocks away on Goodlette-Frank Road.

Fleischmann owned and operated the property until his death in 1968. A year later, the land fell into a new set of hands that would once again transform it forever.

Lawrence and Nancy Jane Tetzlaff, better known as Jungle Larry and Safari Jane, were well-known expedition leaders and zoo operators in the Midwest.

The couple visited Naples in 1967 and fell in love with Caribbean Gardens. They inquired about purchasing the property, but Fleischmann refused to sell.

Shortly after Fleischmann's death, his son, who had inherited the property, offered to lease it to the Tetzlaffs and they immediately agreed.

Work began to incorporate the Tetzlaffs' animals into the garden while preserving as much of the botanical garden as possible.

""All the original animal exhibits were put in with the removal of just one tree,"" said Tim Tetzlaff, Larry and Jane's son. ""That way it maintained the nature of what was then a 50-year-old botanical garden.""

The Tetzlaffs owned and operated the zoo until 2002 when the Fleischmann family expressed an interest in selling the 43 acres of zoo property and the nearly 120 surrounding acres.

Knowing that a buyer would most likely bulldoze the area, the Tetzlaffs asked Collier County to buy the land. In a 2004 referendum, Collier County voters overwhelming agreed to tax themselves to buy the zoo from the Fleischmann family.

Preserving the past and looking to the future

Today the zoo's staff is working to preserve the property's history and ensure that it will be around for the next 100 years.

""The most unique thing about this property is this is as close as you could get to what Naples would have looked like a long time ago,"" said Danielle Green, the zoo's director of gardens and grounds.

""I think it’s very unique in this day and age, no matter where you are in the country, that you’re able to go and visit a place on a regular basis and see plants that your great-great-grandmother would have seen at the time. I think that’s really special.""

Making a Difference: Naples Zoo striving to be a conservation leader

Green and her team care for the hundreds of plants and trees on the property, including eight Nehrling and 11 Fleischmann historic tree specimens.

“Older specimens require a little additional care, no different than that of humans or animals, so we try to pay special attention to them versus some of the younger ones,"" Green said.

Sometimes that additional care means injecting pesticides directly into the tree, said Darryl Windham, the zoo's horticultural manager.

“Some of these trees are so large when you’re trying to do pest control or even fertilizer you can’t just spray the trees,"" he said. ""It’s just not feasible and very impractical to do that.""

In addition to preserving the property's history, the zoo is also working on expansion plans.

The Naples Zoo launched a $25 million fundraising campaign in 2016 to add a flamingo/roseate spoonbill exhibit, Alligator Bay feature, Komodo dragon exhibit, South American rain forest and grasslands trail, nature and water play area for children, and education center, which will be used to host camps and programs for students from Collier and Lee counties and night lectures for adults.

The zoo is also adding a new on-site animal hospital set to be complete in July, a welcome center and a revamped entrance that will remind visitors of the zoo's long history.

“The new entrance has an Old Florida theme, so it will recreate the entrance sign that was on U.S. 41 for all those years with the big toucan we have preserved,"" Tetzlaff said. ""So we’re connecting people with the past, but also with everything that’s new inside.""

"Jabar Gaffney breaks his silence about vandalism case, other allegations","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Facing a felony charge in the vandalism of his former teammate's car and lingering accusations of bad behavior, Derrick ""Jabar"" Gaffney is going on the record -- saying he's been silent long enough and wants to set the record straight.

For the first time in years, the former football player says it's time to explain who he is and why he believes he is misunderstood.

Sitting in a conference room on the second floor of News4Jax studios, calm and focused, Gaffney told his side to the I-TEAM about accusations that have been made against him, his faith in God and family, and the game of football.

Jenese Harris: Do you remember the first time you picked up a football?

Jabar Gaffney: Yes, 2 years old. That was a gift that my mom and dad gave me, and I just ran with it.

Gaffney's talent is not just his own; it's embedded in his DNA. His father, Derrick, uncles Don, Warren and Johnny all played football, too.

His fans will say he was quick on his feet and with his hands as a football player for Raines High School in the 1997 state championship.

""I was a member of the '97 State team, got to catch the game winning touchdown in that game, and we were the first public school to win one,"" Gaffney said.

He got the attention of recruiters, but he stayed close to home and played as a wide receiver for the University of Florida before leaving after two years for a career in the NFL.

Accused of theft at UF

At times, his success on the field became a secondary headline. While at UF, Gaffney was accused of stealing $240 and a watch from Florida Field's locker room. He was dropped from the team.

Gaffney signed a deferred prosecution agreement for felony petty theft that included restitution, and the charges were dropped. He apologized and was allowed back on the team.

Accused of vandalism

Fast forward to the week of Father's Day in 2018, when the car of Gaffney's former teammate and friend Lito Sheppard is caught on surveillance camera being vandalized. According to the police report, Sheppard told investigators he believed the man seen in the video was Jabar Gaffney.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Allegations of vandalism

Sheppard posted a photo from the surveillance video of the incident on his Facebook page, and people began to post that the man had similar features to Gaffney, and they believed that he was the man with a mystery woman. Gaffney says he didn't do it and doesn't know why Sheppard is accusing him.

Sheppard and Jabar Gaffney were childhood friends, playing ball together in high school and college. But, their friendship turned sour.

Harris: When did it fall apart? Your relationship with Lito Sheppard?

Gaffney: I don't really know? Father's Day.

Harris: Of last year?

Gaffney: Yeah.

Harris: So everything between you and Lito Sheppard has been okay you had an okay relationship with him until last year when you were accused of vandalizing his vehicle?

Gaffney: Yes.

Gaffney insists he didn’t have a grudge against Sheppard and Gaffney insists he is not the man in the surveillance video damaging Sheppard's car.

Harris: So have you seen the video? The surveillance video or the photos at least of the surveillance video that people have alleged is you? Have you seen it?

Gaffney: Yes, I have seen it.

Harris: And people say that it's you?

Gaffney: I say that they are lying.

Harris: Where were you that day?

Gaffney: I was with my kids. I was at church, and then I spent the rest of that day with my kids at the house. We were watching movies and we left to go to Popeye's which is just a couple of miles down the street from my house and came back. That's where I was -- with my family.

Gaffney's arrest warrant obtained by the I-TEAM claims the night of the vandalism, another surveillance camera -- one from the Jacksonville neighborhood where Gaffney was living -- captured Gaffney and a woman leaving the neighborhood in the same Audi spotted a short time later pulling up to Sheppard's BMW in Jax Beach

Gaffney told us he was with his children that day, and he does not know who that woman is in the surveillance photos. He showed us a copy of a Popeye's transaction from his bank account from that same day that he said supports his claim of not being the person who vandalized Sheppard's car. However, the document does not show the time of the transaction made at the Neptune Beach restaurant.

""I have pictures of me on Father's Day showing what I look like. The guy in that picture, he looks like he had a haircut I have very long hair and again there's no tattoos and again the guy at the beach, it wasn't me,"" said Gaffney.

Gaffney told us despite the felony charge against him, and despite the fact that Sheppard filed a temporary restraining order that later expired, he still sees Sheppard as a brother.

Harris: If you could talk to Lito right now, what would you say?

Gaffney: Why? That's all I could say. Why? There is nothing else. He knows, he knows that I didn't do it. He knows that it was not me or else there would be all kinds of evidence.

Gaffney's next pre-trial hearing in the vandalism case is set for May 14 with jury selection in his trial set for May 20. However, his attorneys have filed a motion to delay the trial.

The I-TEAM reached out to Lito Sheppard for comment on Gaffney's interview and he said, ""I have nothing to comment about. I'll let him (Jabar Gaffney) proceed.""

Held under the Baker Act

Harris: There is the charge about the vandalism for the vehicle, then we hear information about you being suicidal or wanting to hurt yourself. What was that?

Gaffney: That was, I don't know. I don't know. That was girls being upset with me being brutally honest it was two girls that I was talking to and trying to make connections with and along the way things got turned ugly and we weren't going to see each other.

Gaffney: They made a call to police and said that I wanted to kill myself and that was totally false. I was on the way to Tampa that day. My son had a band recital. He was playing in the band and that was his first time he was going to be performing and I was going to see my son that day. I had never once tried to kill myself at all.

Harris: So then, how do you explain police being at that house and saying that you were taken and committed somewhere? Are you saying that never happened?

Gaffney: I just came out because I was getting phone calls and they were saying that the police were at my house. I said the police are not at my house, I'm in here. I got this call from my sister I told her no I'm fine. She was like are you sure? I was like, ain't nobody at my house because I didn't know that anything was going on. I had took a nap and I was getting ready to get on the road and I walked outside and it's like 50 guns pointed at me and I just I just dropped like I didn't know what to do I just froze up because that was terrifying. I didn't expect to see a whole bunch of guns drawn out on me in front of my house. They took me to the mental health place and locked me up there.

Gaffney said he was at the mental health facility for three days. Prior to arriving there, he said he got sick -- but it was not because he had ingested pills or was trying to kill himself.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Accusations of mental health issues, brain injury

""When I got to the place, they took a sample, drug tested me, didn't find anything. Didn't find no sleeping pills at all in my system. The police were at my house. They came in, they went through my house. There was no gun found in my house or anything,"" he said.

Gaffney said the women made a false claim to police.

Harris: So you are saying you were falsely committed in a mental facility for three days?

Gaffney: Yes.

Harris: What was it like being in there?

Gaffney: It was tough, but I mean I prayed about it and I was just like, God wouldn't have me here if it wasn't a reason behind it I guess. I mean it did good. I got to talk to a lot of people there about this and I talked to the doctor. He said that I was fine, that he just wanted me to stay because I could be a good influence on people that was the whole reason for keeping me there not because I was trying to commit suicide or because I had anything in my system. Got to meet with people, got to pray with people. Made friends with a skin head. I mean it was, I tried to make the best of it so that it wouldn't tear me down that I was in there for no reason.

Accused of having a brain injury from playing football

Shortly after Jabar Gaffney was held for three days, his uncle, Councilman Reggie Gaffney, spoke to the I-TEAM about Jabar. His uncle claimed Jabar's mood had changed. Jabar told us he didn't know his uncle was doing the interview until News4Jax called, asking Jabar for a statement about his uncle's comments.

Harris:​​​​​ What do you have to say about what your uncle said?

Gaffney: It was very disheartening to hear coming from him, when they don't even, me and my uncle, we don't even talk too much.

Harris: So as far as your uncle, do you feel like he even has the ability or the right to say what he is saying?

Gaffney: No, not at all, anybody in my family that should've answered that question should've been my dad or my mom or grandmother.

Gaffney told us his legal issues have reached the ears of his children. He said he comforts them, explaining their dad is fine.

Harris: How do you explain that to them?

Gaffney: Before they could say anything I said, ""You know I love you, right? You know your dad is not going anywhere?"" They said, ""We know."" They smile, (I) hug them and that's it. That's the end of the conversation.

Accused of domestic violence

Jabar Gaffney has also had protective orders filed against him, but he said he's never hit a woman. But, he said women have hit him.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Allegations of domestic violence

Harris: You've also been accused of domestic violence, what do you have to say to that?

Gaffney: That it was all false.

Harris: Why was it false?

Gaffney: Because it was, it was females that were upset and trying to take me down and one of their words was...one of their own words was I am going to take down your whole empire and they just got mad at me for whatever reason it may have been. And trying to take a shot at ruining my name.

Harris: So you never hit a woman in your life?

Gaffney: No.

Harris: Never hit a woman before?

Gaffney: No.

Harris: Never did anything against a woman?

Gaffney: No, never, never before. I have been hit a lot and I have called the police on women and nothing ever happened.

Harris: And why have they been assaulting you?

Gaffney: The same thing. Jealousy for whatever reason.

Accusations of being a ""troublemaker""

Harris: You have these incidents that keep happening and this person says to you, why you? Why do bad things keep happening to you and do you take an accountability for it?

Gaffney: I take accountability for everything that I have ever done in my life. I have always come clean on what I have done whether it was me by myself or other people with me. Like I have always just said my name and never told on anybody else.

For Gaffney, he believes the damage is already done. He told us his mistakes coupled with his name being tarnished has cost him honors at his alma mater.

Gaffney: It cost me part of my legacy with the University of Florida.

Harris: How so?

Gaffney: I am still not in the Athletic Hall of Fame right now. I am not in the Ring of Honor even though I meet the qualifications.

Gaffney: I was the best receiver that ever came through the University of Florida. There has never been a receiver that has two thousand-yard seasons back-to-back. Averaged 100 yards and a touchdown every game. Nobody has came through and done that at the university. Walter Camp, All-American everything, I was the team MVP, National Freshman of the Year, did everything to be in their Athletic Hall of Fame. But it seems like, after that Florida-Georgia thing and Hall of Fame induction, the hate started turning up a little more. The trouble came and from that point, I mean, it's 2019 and I still haven't been put in there, I mean, I know that has something to do with it.

For every accusation, Gaffney said he has been told to remain silent. He said he is tired of being silent. In breaking his silence, he recalls advice given to him from his former New England Patriots coach.

Gaffney: Coach Belichick always told us to speak for yourself so I am here to speak for myself I don't need anyone else to speaking for me anymore.

Harris: What is next for you in your life?

Gaffney: Just continuing what I have been doing, just trying to help the youth reach their potential work with Scott Park. Since we got Scott Park, we have kids going to college every year. It puts a smile on my face.

Gaffney said he has been working behind the scenes to help the youth football teams that practice and play there. As he helps the children with similar dreams of being an NFL star he is cutting people out of his personal life.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW:

Accusations of being a ""troublemaker""

""I am going to continue to live my life, I cut, cut a lot of people out of my life that's how I have been able to stay out of the limelight without negative people around, without people that want to be in your business,"" said Gaffney.

He told us his faith in God keeps him centered.

""I am not saying that I lived a perfect life but I know I am not close to what I am being perceived as now and that's not fair,"" he explained.

Since this interview, Gaffney says he now has a medicinal marijuana card for Florida, which allows him to smoke cannabis for health reasons.

Newly Released Video Captures Moment Tourist Was Punched by Man He Mistook for Uber Driver,"Video of a deadly 2018 encounter that left a young marketing executive dead has been released for the first time.

Sandor Szabo, 35, of Boca Raton, Florida, was leaving his stepsister's wedding reception in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, New York, in August.

Szabo is visibly intoxicated in the video and seen staggering into the street. According to his family, he was looking for his Uber, knocking on several car windows, including the one driven by the accused assailant, who happened to be the assistant basketball coach at Wake Forest University.

Jamill Jones is seen running across the street in pursuit of Szabo after he knocks, punching him in the face and knocking him to the ground. He then walked away and left the scene without helping the victim.



Szabo died four days later from a traumatic head injury he sustained after he hit the ground.

Jones turned himself in and has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge.

At the time, his lawyer spoke on his behalf. ""The Jones family sends their deepest condolences to the Szabo family,"" his attorney said.

But Szabo's parents want the charge against Jones to be upgraded.

""It was of course, so disturbing, and knowing that that was Sandor's last moments,"" his mother told Inside Edition. ""This isn't right; they are refusing to reverse their charge.""

The victim's family believes the new video helps their case that Szabo was not aggressive in his encounter with the basketball coach, as Jones claimed.

""There is nothing like losing your child, it is like losing part of your heart, the pain never goes away,"" his mom said.

Bridgeton man who started High Rise fire faces prison time,"CLOSE Here's the latest for Thursday May 9th: Trump announces hurricane aid for Florida; Trump invokes executive privilege over Mueller report; more AP

BRIDGETON - A Bridgeton man who authorities say caused $2 million worth of damage to a city apartment complex faces up to five years in state prison after a jury found him guilty of criminal mischief Monday.

Bruce Cisrow, 63, of Bridgeton, in May 2017 set fire to clothes in his apartment at Bridgeton High Rise on East Commerce Street, prompting the property's sprinkler system to activate and eventually displacing several tenants at the complex, according to Cumberland County Prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McRae.

Webb McRae said Cisrow was acquitted of aggravated arson and aggravated assault charges.

When Bridgeton police and firefighters arrived on scene at the Bridgeton Housing Authority property during the 2017 incident they found Cisrow throwing objects out of his window and threatening to jump from the sixth floor, according to authorities.

Webb-McRae said Cisrow also was yelling at first-responders to contact Donald Trump and Chris Whitney of the National Security Agency.

A police officer on patrol at the time saw smoke and flames coming from a window of the 10-story, 100-unit property.

The officer found the apartment door locked but heard yelling from a balcony, where he found Cisrow.

Police said Cisrow threw a chair out his bathroom window as firefighters were arriving and nearly hit one. Firefighters got into the apartment, removed Cisrow, and handed him over to police.

Police said Cisrow had barricaded his door, set a fire, and locked himself into his bathroom.

He was taken to Inspira Health Center Bridgeton for a psychological examination before being placed in Cumberland County Jail.

In additional to the estimated $2 million in damage, Webb-McRae said several High Rise tenants were displaced for about six months.

Cisrow faces three to five years in state prison and is scheduled for sentencing on June 14, Webb-McRae said.

Rob Thomas

Rob Thomas is known as the front-man for Matchbox 20, but perhaps his greatest claim to fame was singing on Santana's wildly successful song ""Smooth"" that he co-wrote.

It won three Grammys in 2000, including Song of the Year and as last year Billboard considered the second most successful song of all time after Chubby Checker's 1960 hit ""The Twist.""

Thomas and his ""Chip Tooth Tour"" into the Sunshine State this summer, with concerts set for July 2 at Mizner Park in Boca Raton; July 3 at Hard Rock Live Orlando; July 5 at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg; and July 6 at Daily's Place in Jacksonville.

His Matchbox 20 hits have remained pop music staples in recent years, including ""Real World,""""3AM"" and ""Push.""

Brian Regan

Jerry Seinfeld has called him one of his favorite comedians, and Brian Regan has earned his stature among standup legends.

The South Florida native tours it seems constantly, and returns to Florida with shows July 26 at Barbara B. Mann Hall in Fort Myers with tickets around $50 each.

The next night, Regan is at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg and tickets start around $40.

Regan is known for his clean comedy, with popular skits including ""Say Eight"" and ""Doughnut Lady.""

He still prides himself on being able to walk in public pretty much anonymously; a few years ago in an interview with the Naples Daily News, Regan discussed how he and his children had just spent a day at Disney World in Orlando and he went unrecognized.

"Lonely 6-year-old's 911 call becomes teachable moment, bond with Florida police officer","(Note: If you cannot see and hear the embedded audio above, visit our Sound Cloud page to hear the call.)

A 911 call from a lonely 6-year-old boy could have ended with stern discipline instead of a stuffed animal and perhaps a budding friendship.

The boy, who's name hasn't been released, said his mom was ""mean"" and made him cry, according to the 911 call. The dispatcher stayed on the line and asked him several questions, including his age, address and where were his parents, who were unaware their son called 911.

Tallahassee Police Officer Joe White was en route when the boy called a few more times to make sure an officer was coming. Once he arrived, the boy asked if he and White could be friends.

The Tallahassee Police Department posted on Facebook pictures of White and the boy holding a stuffed animal given by White. The officer informed the boy of when to use 911.

TPD spokesman Damon Miller told the Tallahassee Democrat the social media post was made by another public information officer so he couldn't confirm whether White made contact with the boy's parents before the post was made public.

Here’s Officer Joe White's his new friend, who called 911 because he was lonely. (Photo: Tallahassee Police Department)

Steve Harrelson, director of the Consolidated Dispatch Agency, said it's rare that a child calls 911 because they're lonely.

""Realizing he was a child, we put some extra attention to that,"" said Harrelson, who urged parents to teach their children about 911. ""It was a great conclusion to an incident that could have been a lot worse. (White) used that moment to educate the uses of 911 ... It worked all the way around for everyone.""

Miller said White did what most officers do every day, but most people don't know about. He said it's not unusual for officers to have similar encounters with children.

""He let the young man know that they can be his friend and how to use the 911,"" Miller said. ""This is a classic example that we are humans as well, and we are not robots.""

Man fighting to save home after City of Dunedin moves to foreclose for grass not being cut,"DUNEDIN, Fla. (WFLA) - A man is fighting to save his house after the city he lives in has made moves to foreclose on his home for not cutting his grass.

Jim Fick doesn't argue that his yard should have been mowed when he was out of town, but he doesn't think he should lose his home over uncut grass.

When he left for North Carolina in May 2018 to sell his late mother's condo, he made arrangements for a friend to cut his grass.

""Apparently when you have the combination of the summer temperatures and it's raining every other day, it's just that growing season [for grass],"" says Fick.

But his friend suddenly died.

He didn't find out until he returned mid July.

A city of Dunedin code inspector found his grass to be more than 10 inches tall on July 5. Considering him a repeat offender, they started fining him $500 a day.

Fick says in the past when his grass has gotten too high, he's gotten notices in the mail, but when it came to the moment he's getting fined hundreds of dollars a day, he heard nothing from the city of Dunedin.

""In my case they didn't even mail the notice until August 22 or 23 to let me know that they were running the fines since July 5,"" said Fick.

He had to leave in August and was fined again for an additional 10 days of tall grass.

""Of course by then the fine had already run the $28,000 in recurring.""

The Dunedin code enforcement board has now moved to foreclose on Fick's home and he is hoping the 8th Amendment and lawyers at the Institute for Justice will save his home.

""We are arguing in our lawsuit that limitless fines are unconstitutional,"" said the Institute for Justice's lead attorney on the case, Ari Bargil.

According to Fick's attorneys, they say, depending on the outcome of the case, it could affect similar cases like his in the city of Dunedin.

The lawsuit against the city argues the fines are excessive.

Clearwater police seek well-dressed wallet snatcher,"CLEARWATER, Fla. (WFLA) - Clearwater police are searching for a well-dressed crook who plucked a woman's wallet out of her purse while she was picking produce.

The department released video of the caper on its Facebook page.

It happened on April 28 at the Whole Foods store in the Westfield Countryside Mall in Clearwater.

Police spokesman Rob Shaw says the video shows the man walking around the produce section of the store. He then spots the woman.

""He's shopping around the produce area but he does seem to keep an eye on this woman, he probably notices she has a purse in the front part of the cart,"" said Shaw.

""And that she's occasionally picking out different items of produce there.""

The man swipes the wallet and quickly exits the store.

Police say he then made his way south to the Best Buy store on Drew Street and U.S. 19 where he attempted to purchase thousands of dollars in items.

It didn't work.

The victim didn't realize she's been ripped off until she went to check out at the Whole Foods and discovered her wallet was gone.

Police are hoping someone recognizes the man and turns him in.

In the meantime, they are warning women to keep an eye on their valuables, even in stores where they believe they won't be targeted.

""And I've talked to some of our female detectives asking what do you do? Some have talked about how they would loop their purse strap around the cart and maybe turn it upside down,"" said Shaw.

""Just, not make it easy for the criminal.""

Police: Man wanted for dragging dog behind truck in Florida,"- Investigators have identified a man wanted for dragging a dog behind his truck down a roadway in Spring Hill last week.

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office said they are looking for 58-year-old Gregory Tousignant, who has a warrant out for his arrest for a misdemeanor charge of animal cruelty.

The incident happened Wednesday, May 1, when witnesses saw a young pit bull mix being dragged behind the pickup truck by a piece of rope attached to his collar.

Witnesses told deputies it appeared that Tousignant was unaware the dog had jumped out of the bed of his truck. The dog had been tied to the truck's bumper and came free from the collar when the truck made a turn.

The sheriff's office said it is illegal to carry any pet in the bed of a truck that is not properly secured and prevented from jumping out of the moving vehicle.

The 1-year-old dog was brought to a Weeki Wachee animal clinic for treatment.

Because Tousignant is homeless, deputies are asking for the public's help to find him. Anyone with information on his whereabouts is asked to call the sheriff's office at 352-754-6830.",http://www.fox29.com/news/deputies-identify-man-wanted-for-dragging-dog-behind-truck-in-hernando-county,2019-05-08T17:34:48Z,FOX 29,"330 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19106, USA"
"Pensacola suspect in toddler 'torture' case died by suicide, sheriff confirms","A Pensacola man accused of inflicting ""systematic torture"" on a toddler has died roughly one week after hanging himself in his jail cell, according to an Escambia County Sheriff's Office investigation.

Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius, 37, was found hanging in his jail cell around 11 p.m. May 1, a few hours after being charged with physically and emotionally abusing his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter.

Celaius was transported to a local hospital, and he remained there until family members made the decision to terminate his life support. Celaius was pronounced deceased at 1:13 p.m. Tuesday, Sheriff David Morgan said Wednesday.

The Sheriff's Office has been investigating the incident per standard procedure, and Morgan said preliminary findings indicate that Celaius' injuries were self-inflicted. Morgan said security camera footage and activity logs indicated that county corrections staff had been walking the pod and inspecting cells in accordance with jail policy at the time of the incident.

The Sheriff's Office declined to comment on what implement Celaius used to hang himself, other than to say it was available in the cell.

Allegations of torture: In wolf mask and Batman PJs, Pensacola man tortured child for cameras, report says

Escambia County revamped its suicide prevention policy a few years ago after a rash of deaths in the jail, but there has been significant turnover in the county administration, including four corrections directors over roughly the past five years.

Morgan noted that even with Celaius' death, the Sheriff's Office would continue its investigation into the abuse occurring in Celaius' home.

""We're looking for any additional victims, and anyone who might have had knowledge of the crimes being committed and failed to report them,"" Morgan said.

Noting that everyone has a legal obligation to report child abuse in Florida, the sheriff said, ""We'll continue with this case, and if we find out there are those who failed to report the abuse of children, they may be facing charges, too.""

Celaius' arrest report alleges that he had routinely abused the toddler over a two-month span by throwing objects at her as she slept, shooting her in the head repeatedly with a BB gun and jolting her with an electric dog collar. He allegedly recorded the abuse on home surveillance cameras and personal cellphones.

Morgan said the Sheriff's Office is working with the Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies to investigate whether any of the videos had made their way to the internet or into the hands of others.

""Right now we have no proof the videos were shared or sold or anything else, but there is a market for — just like there is for child pornography — films involving torture,"" Morgan said, before adding for emphasis, ""But we don't have any indication of that right now.""

Celaius was initially booked into Escambia County Jail on April 9 on drug charges, but on May 1, the Sheriff's Office announced Celaius was facing new charges related to child abuse.

Jail personnel moved Celaius into protective custody immediately after the press conference announcing the new charges, but a few hours later, he was transported to a local hospital. County officials said he remained in the hospital until his death Tuesday.

One of Celaius friends, Eric Everett Furnans, was arrested after allegedly honoring Celaius' request to destroy cellphones believed to contain video of the abuse.

Morgan said the case again Furnans would be unaffected by Celaius' death.

He immediately went to the hospital to be treated.

Copeland posted the video of the terrifying encounter to Facebook.

Richard Ewers has only one week to live.KSAT reports the 71-year-old has made it his life's mission to give homes to dumped or stray dogs. After people learned last year he was dying of cancer, they stepped up to try to help his 27 rescue dogs. Mary Oyler, with Save Our Strays San Antonio, said Ewers has been put in hospice and there isn't much time left to find a place for his remaining 11 dogs. It is his dying wish that they all go to good homes. “They can't be here much longer,” said Oyler. Oyler and volunteers with Save Our Strays San Antonio have been coming to Ewers’ home every day to feed the dogs, spend time with them and give them water.“We are very sad by this, of course, and we want to make that last wish come true for him,” Oyler said.If the remaining dogs aren't adopted, they will be picked up by the county. “It would add a lot more stress to what they are going through already,” Oyler said. “Not having Mr. Richard here, there's confusion, loneliness. There's depression.”Oyler said her biggest concern is that the dogs are alone, and the conditions at Ewers' home are not ideal.“There's no one to give them attention and love,” Oyler said. “There is no running water. There is no electricity. The conditions are just not ideal.”She said whoever adopts the dogs will need to be patient with them.“There's a lot of work involved,” Oyler said. “All they've ever known is Mr. Richard, so it's going to require a family that has a lot of patience.”A Facebook page is available for anyone who wants to help Ewers and his dogs.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/man-with-one-week-to-live-has-dying-wish-of-getting-his-11-rescue-dogs-adopted/27402190,2019-05-08T10:13:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA"
Man accused of making threatening anti-Semitic calls to bagel shop,"MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - A Miami man was arrested Tuesday after police said he made threatening phone calls to a Miami Beach bagel shop, targeting the business because its owners were Jewish.

Jorge Mateo Rucinque, 26, faces a charge of making threatening phone calls.

According to the arrest report, Rucinque made several calls on Monday to Bagel Time Cafe in the 3900 block of Alton Road. In one of the calls, Rucinque told the owner's wife that he would ""explode the Jewish community,"" the report said.

After his arrest by the Miami Beach Police Department's Intelligence Unit, Rucinque told officers that he sought out Jewish businesses by searching the internet for key words such ""Jews"" and ""kosher,"" the report said. Rucinque works as an Uber driver.

According to the police report, Rucinque did not posses any weapons when he was arrested at his home.

Yehoshua Nodel, the owner of the cafe, told Local 10's Andrew Perez that Rucinque basically told his wife that Jews were taking over the world.

""(He said,) 'We're going to make sure you can't overpopulate like you are now and we're going to get rid of you,' basically,"" Nodel said. ""'I'm here. That's my mission.'""

Nodel said he alerted police after the calls, especially in light of recent deadly attacks on synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, California.

""This thing could happen in any of our businesses all around Miami,"" Nodel said. ""Personally, I wouldn't get a gun permit until today, but now I'm rethinking it, you know? Maybe it's something I should have.""

Late Tuesday, Rucinque was held on $500 bond at Miami-Dade County's Turner Guildford Knight Correctional Center.

Florida Woman Allegedly Pulls Gator From Yoga Pants During Traffic Stop,"Police in Florida say they pulled a couple over after they blew through a stop sign. But there's no way officers could have predicted what they would find inside the car.

After a quick search, officers found 41 turtles stuffed in a bag. When cops asked if the pair had anything else, the woman allegedly whipped out a 12-inch-long alligator from her yoga pants.

According to the man's father, it was just an ordinary day for his son. ""Not surprised at all,"" he told WINK, laughing. ""He didn't hurt them at all. He just loves animals and catches them and releases them.""

WINK reported that the two told authorities they'd been collecting snakes and frogs from a nearby overpass.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission ended up collecting the reptiles and then releasing them.

Floridians must have a permit to hunt alligators, so the pair was cited for their little passenger.

US adversaries are watching us self-destruct as Trump foreign policy spins into chaos,"Trump has blundered into conflict with competitors, insulted allies and made the US a laughingstock. No one is in charge, and it's frightening.

If we take a moment to pull ourselves away from the daily melodrama of President Donald Trump’s efforts to suppress a report that he claims exonerates him, we might notice that American foreign policy has spiraled completely out of control.

Our trade war with China continues, for no other reason than that the president does not understand how the international economy works. After two splashy but vacuous summits that never should have happened, the North Koreans continue to press ahead with their nuclear program.

Meanwhile, Trump’s clumsy ditching of the Iran deal has achieved the miracle of ceding the moral high ground to Tehran and making a terror-supporting regime seem like the aggrieved party. The Iranians are now threatening to resume parts of their nuclear program that would put them closer to potentially making a bomb — as the White House stares dumbfounded, with no second move for a contingency that anyone who can think more than 10 seconds ahead would have seen coming.

One of my Saudi clients is dead. Another is living, but he could be next: Exiled lawyer

After a promise to restore America’s standing in the world, Trump has blundered into conflict with our competitors, insulted our allies, and generally made the United States into a laughingstock.

Why is this happening? Who’s in charge in Washington these days?

A frightening leadership vacuum

The easy answer is to blame all of this on National Security Adviser John Bolton. Bolton had to swallow almost every position he ever held to get the job in the White House, and it would be reasonable to assume that he is now trying to execute his own agenda while Trump is busy trying to avoid any number of humiliations, including impeachment.

But this is unfair. Bolton doesn’t know what he’s doing, either. From Iran to Venezuela, Bolton is indulging a set of atavistic reflexes — a predilection for confrontation, a belief in the utility of intervention, a disdain for negotiated solutions, a hatred of treaties and international institutions — rather than following any kind of strategy. There is no more a “Bolton Doctrine” than there is a “Trump Doctrine.”

The more frightening answer is that no one is in charge. The president has no obvious interest in national security and foreign affairs, except insofar as such things affect him personally. Even if the president wanted to direct a more coherent foreign policy, there’s not much of a team left to direct. A quick read of the rosters in the departments of State and Defense leaves the impression that the most common last names in the higher echelons of government are “Vacant” and “Acting.”

Putin and Russia keep humiliating Trump

This has left the foreign policy establishment on autopilot, with various offices and bureaucracies continuing along — fortunately for America — with policies from the Barack Obama and even George W. Bush eras in the absence of any other direction. In those few times when Trump gets involved in policy, it is mostly to contradict his own administration, whether on intervention in Venezuela, forces in Syria, or sanctions on Russia.

Russia is a particularly galling example of the free-fall of American foreign policy. When Trump inexplicably felt the need to call Russian President Vladimir Putin and discuss the Mueller report, Putin — in a kind of reverse Monroe Doctrine — made sure to remind the president of the United States to keep his nose out of Venezuela. (This from the man who, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, persuaded Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro to stick around just as he was about to leave for Cuba.)

In any competent American administration, this would be a dire insult. Any other U.S. president would have then reminded Putin that his country has a GDP somewhere between Florida and Brazil, that Venezuela is in Latin America, and that maybe the Russians should think about ceasing their aggression against their neighbors.

Instead, Putin made clear he wants the incoming president of Ukraine pressured to honor agreements with Russia — a brazen act of chutzpah (or, as the Russians call this level of nervy arrogance, naglost) with Russian troops occupying Ukrainian territory. The message to Trump: ""Tell that guy that I want him to observe the accord I am violating.""

Our adversaries are watching us self-destruct

Trump likes to claim that he’s been tougher on Russia than any other U.S. president. though Ronald Reagan and Harry Truman and might take issue with that. His supporters note, rightly, that many sanctions are still in place against Russia, but there has been no lack of effort by Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to dump them. Republicans brag about Trump’s toughness while Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska pours millions of dollars into trying to make aluminum in McConnell’s home state Kentucky.

So much for “tough on Russia.”

Meanwhile, the carrier Abraham Lincoln is heading for the Persian Gulf. And Trump supporters would note with pride that North Korea, which in 2017 tested a long-range missile capable of hitting the United States, hasn’t tested any other long-range missiles — yet. Instead, Pyongyang has been firing off the type of short-range missiles ""that will start the war,"" weapons expert Melissa Hanham told Reuters.

Trump has avoided a major conflict so far through a combination of luck and the opportunism of America’s enemies. The Russians, Chinese, Iranians and others have not yet forced us into a crisis, remaining content instead to see the United States floundering about on its own. There is no need, after all, to destroy American power and prestige if the White House is willing to do all the same damage by itself.

But this will not last. The United States, and the international system it helped create, cannot continue indefinitely along a path of incoherence and ignorance. Trump may not even be in office when the reckoning comes. The question is whether we will be ready.

Layne Chesney, a Florida teen who suffered burns over 95 percent of her body on New Year's Eve in 2017, died Friday.People running the Facebook page ""Pray for Layne Chesney"" posted the update on Layne, who was 16.""Layne was called home today by our creator. She fought a hard battle right until the end -- never wanting to quit -- because quitting was not in her nature.""Layne had been receiving care in the burn unit of Jackson Memorial Hospital and later in Texas. In June, Layne had been showing signs of progress, including being able to walk about 25 feet. ""We are heart broken, but remain always grateful that she was a part of our lives and world -- we just wish it had been for a lot longer with us here on Earth,"" the Facebook post said.""We ask that you give the family time to grieve. Leigh Ann has asked that contacts not be made as they all need time to grieve, process, and move through this terrible loss. Thank you all for your love, prayers and support that you have shown for Layne and our family. We are broken.""On Wednesday, a Facebook post said ""she's been having difficulty maintaining her oxygen saturation levels and her blood pressure has been less than stable. Her latest grafts really didn’t adhere as well as we had hoped. ... Her urine output has declined and her heart function isn’t quite as good as the last time she was evaluated.""Layne had poured gasoline on a bonfire on a fire pit at a friend's house when she was 14.She attended Lincoln Park Academy, where she played softball.Layne was the star of the Jensen Beach Wildcats when they won the World Series in the summer of 2017. Last June, girls from her Treasure Coast team were playing in the World Series in her honor at Pineapple Park in Jensen Beach, including wearing her initials and uniform number written on their arms. Even their opponents in the championship game, a team from Louisiana, had #LAYNESTRONG written on the back of their helmets.The first pitch was thrown out by Layne’s grandfather, Tony Wirz.“People from all over the world literally have contacted us saying, ‘We are playing for Layne.

Sunroof rider accused of felony domestic violence,"LAKELAND — A Lakeland man who stood up in his sunroof with his car on cruise control while driving down I-4 was arrested by the Florida Highway Patrol on Tuesday, not only for his wreckless driving, but also for a Polk County Sheriff's Office warrant for domestic violence.

Polk County Sheriff's Office deputies had made contact with 70-year-old Leonard Olsen by phone on Tuesday, and he agreed to turn himself in to the PCSO Northwest District substation on Wedgewood Estates Boulevard in North Lakeland, according to reports. But while the deputies were on their way to meet him, they noticed the FHP had pulled him over.

After he was booked into the South County Jail, deputies served the PCSO warrant for felony domestic violence.

The domestic violence was reported to have started on April 30, when Olsen allegedly became upset with the victim for taking too long to come to bed. Once she was in bed, he began calling her names and blaring the music so she could not sleep, according to reports.

Olsen then reached over and choked the victim, according to his arrest affidavit. In pain and though her breathing was restricted, according to reports, she was eventually able to push Olsen away and they went to bed without further incident. The following day, she had a hoarse voice and had bruising on her neck.

On Sunday, May 5, during the evening hours, the victim returned from dinner with her daughter and grandchild. As she began changing into her pajamas to get ready for bed, she came out of the bathroom to see Olsen ripping apart the dress she had been wearing. Olsen then allegedly called her vulgar names and accused her of having an affair. Then Olsen asked where her bra was located, and when she did not initially give him the bra, he threatened to destroy every bra in her dresser if she did not give it to him, according to his arrest affidavit. Once she gave him the bra, he also tore that apart and then asked where her underwear was that she had been wearing and when she said she was still wearing it, he allegedly began pulling on them in a violent fashion.

According to his arrest affidavit, Olsen continued to yell vulgarities at her and played the music loudly so she could not fall asleep, for several hours.

On Monday, May 6, about 6 a.m., Olsen woke up and began slamming dresser drawers, turning the lights on and off, and turning on the music, waking up the victim, according to PCSO reports released to the media Saturday afternoon.

Since the victim could not fall back asleep, she went into the bathroom and began listening to a motivational verse on her cellphone, which was on the bathroom counter. Olsen allegedly walked into the bathroom, took her cellphone and put it in his pocket. The victim followed Olsen into the bedroom to try to get her cellphone back.

According to his arrest affidavit, Olsen reached out and pushed the victim, causing her to fall onto the bed, then straddled the victim by placing one hand on her upper arm and one hand on her throat.

The victim was able to push Olsen's hand off her throat, but then he allegedly placed his thumb in the victim's mouth, which she bit. Once the victim bit Olsen, he moved off of the victim, according to his arrest affidavit.

At this point, Olsen then allegedly blocked the bedroom door, and refused to move at first. Later, Olsen left the residence and the victim called law enforcement to report the incident.

Olsen and the victim have three children in common and have been together 47 years.

Olsen is being held on $21,000 bond at Polk County Jail, $5,000 per PCSO domestic violence charge, and $1,000 per the FHP charge.

"After regular Baker Act committals, program helps teen","NAPLES — Caleb Caldwell's delicate peace with himself wavered earlier this year when a violent outburst nearly led to a mental health evaluation under Florida's Baker Act — yet again.

The 19-year-old from Naples had skipped some of the medications he takes to treat symptoms of his bipolar disorder and got into an argument with his mother and brother.

""He was being very violent. And he did put his hands on me,"" said his mother, Mellisa Caldwell. ""He just gets really out of hand. He does. And he's a big guy.""

But given the troubles of Caleb's life, the fact this lapse was not worse is something of a victory.

Caleb, an otherwise soft-spoken young man who finally landed a paying job and hopes to work in sports medicine, spent most of his early and mid-adolescence in and out of mental health crisis units.

It was before his condition had been fully diagnosed, and his prescribed medication was wanting.

He was bullied. He had violent outbursts at home and at school. He regularly threatened suicide. And at one point, he was getting committed under the Baker Act nearly every other week.

The boy's troubling behavior, his later mood swings and propensity to violence — seemingly without remorse — even prompted one psychiatrist to tell the Naples family that the boy had ""sociopathic criminal potential.""

So much happened, and so much of it seems like a blur to Caleb.

""A lot of this has been going on for so long that I don't remember a lot,"" Caleb said.

Then, when he was 16, after one of his threats to kill himself and another Baker Act evaluation at the David Lawrence Center in East Naples, real progress: a new diagnosis and treatment plan that seemed to better address his behavior problems.

It turns out that Caleb, now 19, was on the autism spectrum, something multiple mental health professionals he encountered failed to notice, according to his family. He got different medications and found a mental health counselor who is helping him control his impulses.

He soon got an internship with the NCH Baker Downtown Hospital as part of the Project SEARCH program, which helps find jobs for teens and young adults with developmental disabilities.

Before his last behavioral lapse — the first serious one in years — Caleb said he hoped those days were behind him.

""There are times when I have some issues, but it doesn't get to that point anymore,"" he said.

But the family knows there will never be a treatment silver bullet. Caleb's problems will never just go away.

They consider themselves lucky because of the help from the David Lawrence Center and that they have the means to aggressively work to find him treatment. But they worry about Caleb's future.

He is transitioning into the working world. He still lives with his parents, but if he is committed under the Baker Act again, now as an adult, law enforcement officers would not be required to contact them.

Mellisa Caldwell is trying to establish legal guardianship of him into adulthood. Caleb isn't quite sure what he thinks about that.

""I feel like there are times that I need it,"" he said. ""But I think there are times when I need my own space and think I'm fine on my own. But I do think there are times — like when I get Baker Acted - what would I have done if she wasn't there?""",https://www.newschief.com/news/20190511/after-regular-baker-act-committals-program-helps-teen?rssfeed=true,2019-05-11T16:26:25Z,News Chief,"455 6th St NW, Winter Haven, FL 33881, USA"
Family reacts to barge fire report: 'My brother would still be here today',"CLOSE Port of Corpus Christi plans crude oil terminal on Harbor Island Courtney M Sacco, Corpus Christi Caller-Times

After more than a year, there is some clarity on what caused a deadly barge fire near Port Aransas — Ineffective maintenance and safety management.

That's according to an April report from the National Transportation Safety Board that was released publicly Thursday.

""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the explosion aboard the barge B. No. 255 was the lack of effective maintenance and safety management of the barge by Bouchard Transportation, which resulted in crude oil cargo leaking through a corroded bulkhead into the forepeak void space, forming vapor, and igniting,"" the document states.

The report continues that other contributing factors to the accident ""were the ineffective inspections and surveys by the Coast Guard and the American Bureau of Shipping.""

""The number one thing that is going through my mind is that this event was 100 percent preventable,"" said Sarah Crumbley, the sister of Zachariah Jackson, one of the crewmen. ""It's very hard to deal with the fact that my brother would still be here today.""

“It very hard to deal with the fact that my brother would still be here today.” Sarah Crumbley

On Oct. 20, 2017, the oil barge caught on fire and exploded off the coast of Port Aransas. Two crew members — Jackson, 28, and Dujour Vanterpool — were reported missing.

Days later, the body of a man washed up on the beach of Padre Island. The man was identified as Vanterpool, 26.

Jackson's body has not been recovered.

""The hardest part of not having a recovery is knowing that my brother, his resting place is in the ocean, and that the only place we can go to mourn him is the waterway,"" said Crumbley, 28, who lives in Deltona, Florida.

The Bouchard Transportation Co., Inc. barge had about 140,000 barrels of crude oil on board, a U.S. Coast Guard fact sheet states. According to the report, about 84,000 gallons of crude oil was released into the sea and atmosphere as a result of the explosion.

“The series of failures documented during this investigation highlights the need for effective safety management systems, proper vessel maintenance, and thorough regulatory examinations,” said the board's Director of Marine Safety Brian Curtis in a statement.

The board recommended Bouchard evaluate its safety management system with a third party to figure out what allowed for the ""poor mechanical and structural condition"" of the barge.

The Coast Guard and American Bureau of Shipping were told to create a joint policy and procedure to share information related to vessel safety, the report states.

""If implemented, the recommendations issued as a result of this investigation will help to identify the failures that led to this accident and prevent similar casualties in the future,"" Curtis said.

Coast Guard external affairs officer Lt. Leslie Marchalonis said the Coast Guard is still in the process of formulating its report, and declined to comment further.

The report notes an inspection of 25 other Bouchard Transportation barges after the fire revealed ""251 deficiencies"" and resulted in ""operational controls"" being placed on 10 barges, ""limiting or preventing their operation until the discrepancies were corrected.""

A representative from Bouchard said the company would release a statement on the report Friday. A statement has not been received as of press time. An attorney representing the company in a civil lawsuit pending in Nueces County declined comment.

Jackson's parents are seeking damages of more than $1 million in a wrongful death claim, according to court documents.

Zachariah Jackson (Photo: Contributed//Sarah Crumbley)

Morgan Jackson described his brother as someone who was always tried to help others. He also used to work for Bouchard and said the two talked nearly every day, and had goals for the future.

""It's hard not having him here because every day, there's something I would normally call Zach for and we would talk about it,"" said Morgan Jackson, 29.

He said the two talked on the phone just hours before the fire. Zachariah Jackson told him ""Happy Birthday,"" and mentioned ""issues on the barge"" he was trying to get addressed.

""Had I known ... four hours later he was gonna be hurt, or killed, I (wouldn't) have ended that call,"" he said.

Crumbley called her brother kindhearted and loving. Her husband Christopher Crumbley said reading the report was ""like reliving everything that happened.""

Brandon Dove, Zachariah Jackson's other brother, said in a statement it's an everyday struggle to accept the situation.

""Knowing that it was due to a lack of due diligence and failing to follow procedures makes it even worse,"" he wrote.

Family sues Lake County sheriff after deadly crash,"LAKE COUNTY, Fla. - A local family is suing the Sheriff of Lake County after their son was killed during a high-speed chase.



Yadira Santiago and Carlos Sanchez filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Lake County Sheriff Peyton Grinnell after their son was killed in a deadly crash that followed a chase.

The chase violated the department's policy, and according to the lawsuit, a high ranking sheriff's office employee is to blame.

""Its been very hard."" Santiago said. ""It changed our lives.""

The lawsuit claims a sheriff's deputy's negligence led to the wrongful death of 19-year-old Carlos Sanchez-Santiago.

""Your kids are supposed to bury you, not the other way around,"" Santiago said.

In April 2017, Sanchez-Santiago was driving home from work at Universal Studios as Lake County deputies tried to pull over a driver who had run a red light.

A camera from a deputy's cruiser captured what happened next.

According to reports, the driver, 23-year-old Wilvenson Darius, didn't stop and deputies chased him.

The chase went for miles around Lake County and one deputy admitted traveling 130 mph, according to reports obtained by News 6.

Minutes later, as Darius crossed the county line leaving Lake County and entering Orange County, deputies say he lost control, and crashed head-on into Sanchez-Santiago's car.

""Why chase?"" Sanchez said. ""I'm not happy and the system is not good,"" he said.

The lawsuit alleges Deputy Joshua Creech violated the chase policy of the defendant in the lawsuit. Dashcam video and radio communications later revealed Creech lied about what happened.

Before the crash Creech followed the driver to a dead-end road. That's when Creech reports the driver tried to hit him.

""He just tried to hit me head on,"" Creech can be heard saying in radio transmissions.

But the dashcam video shows Darius' mustang driving past as Creech walks toward it.

""The dashcam video contradicts Creech's statement,"" according to an Internal Affairs Report obtained by News 6 .

But that statement kicked the chase into high gear, because Lake County policy does allow deputies to pursue suspects accused of forcible felonies.

""I blame the police,"" Sanchez told News 6.

""They don't have to do that for minor infractions,"" Santiago said.

""As a direct and proximate result of the negligence of Lake County Deputy Joshua Creech, and vicarious negligence of Defendant Peyton C. Grinnell, Carlos Sanchez Santiago suffered death,"" the lawsuit alleges.

""Nothing that happens in this world is going to bring him back, so I would like justice so it doesn't happen to anybody else,"" Santiago said.

The man who was running from deputies, Darius was convicted of vehicular homicide and sentenced in December to 20 years in prison, plus 10 years of probation.

Grinnell filed a response to the lawsuit saying he and his deputies are not liable for the crash that killed Sanchez-Santiago.

""Darius' actions of violating traffic laws and felony fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer were the sole cause of subject accident,"" according to the sheriff's response.

Creech is still employed at the Lake County Sheriff's Office. After the Internal Affairs investigation he lost 10 vacation days as punishment.

"Mass. Woman Severely Injured in Hit and Run, Police Ask for Help Finding Witnesses","Police are asking for help finding witnesses of a hit-and-run accident that left a woman in critical condition in Westport, Massachusetts.

The Westport Police Department said they were alerted to the crash around 8:15 p.m. Tuesday evening.

The victim, 30-year-old Stephanie Tripp, was located by first responders on Old Bedford Road lying facedown in the breakdown lane with serious injuries. The Fall River resident was taken to Rhode Island Hospital and remains in critical condition.

Authorities said the victim was walking on the roadside when she was hit. The driver was reportedly male, and was driving a sedan-style car. A witness told police he left the car and told the witness that he did not intend to hit the woman and was sorry.

Father Says Attempt to Pawn Baby Was a Stunt for Snapchat

The witness told the driver to stay and wait for police, but officials said the man drove off eastbound while the witness was helping the victim.

A different witness tried to follow the suspect, who was reportedly speeding and swerving past cars by going into the opposite lane of traffic, but eventually lost sight of the suspect's car around Faunce Corner Road in Dartmouth.

The vehicle was last seen at the corner of Old Fall River Road and Faunce Corner Road in Dartmouth around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday. It may have minor front end damage.

Police: Stepfather of missing girl changed story,"HOUSTON (AP) — The Latest on the search for a 4-year-old girl who was reported missing in Houston (all times local):

7:30 p.m.

Police in a suburb of Houston say a Texas man who reported his 4-year-old stepdaughter missing Saturday repeatedly changed his story during initial interviews.

Houston police say Darion Vence told investigators Maleah Davis was abducted more than 24-hours earlier by men in a pickup truck who knocked him out but then let him and his 2-year-old son go.

But Vence was first interviewed by Sugar Land police, and a spokesman for that city’s department says his account “changed several times.”

Houston police are leading the investigation. They say it is ongoing and that they don’t identify “persons of interest or suspects unless charges are filed.”

A phone message requesting comment left at a number listed for Vence was not immediately returned.

Sugar Land is about 22 miles (35.4 kilometers) southwest of Houston.

A 4-year-old Houston girl who has been missing since her stepfather reported she was abducted had previously been removed from her home by state workers concerned about allegations of physical abuse.

Officials with state Child Protective Services in Houston say Maleah Davis was removed from her home in August after she suffered a head injury and was then returned to the home in February. Her two brothers also were removed over that period. All three were placed with relatives.

CPS caseworkers have been monitoring the home since the children were returned.

Searchers are looking for the girl after her stepfather reported he stopped their vehicle Friday night to check a tire when the men pulled up behind them.

Darion Vence told authorities he was knocked unconscious and when he awoke the next day, Maleah was gone.",http://www.wfla.com/national/police-stepfather-of-missing-girl-changed-story/1992269281,2019-05-09T16:03:04Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"
Suzy Fleming Leonard: Scott's on Fifth chef invited to cook at James Beard House in NYC,"CLOSE Scott Earick, chef and owner at Scott's on Fifth in Indialantic, talks about his love for cooking -- and tacos. Suzy Fleming Leonard, FLORIDA TODAY

Being my friend comes with a cost.

Since chef Scott Earick and I met eight years ago, my causes have become his causes. He’s closed his restaurant on a potentially busy Friday night to cook for the Brevard Zoo. He’s scaled the side of a building and spent his one free night a week teaching a cooking class for Habitat for Humanity. He’s spent a Sunday morning stirring together lobster bisque for Daily Bread.

I’m not even counting the time he showed my book club how to make his signature Bang Bang Sauce or the video I shot while I talked him into trying durian fruit.

All I have to do is ask, and he puts on an apron, grabs a spatula and goes to work.

The owner of Scott’s on Fifth in Indialantic has a big personality, an even bigger heart, and I love him for both.

When your friends are good to you, you want great things for them, so I have to admit, I'm a little giddy over what's happening for Scott right now.

At 58, he’s been given an honor few in his chosen profession will achieve. He’ll be cooking at the venerable James Beard House in New York City.

It’s not an honor he sought, but it's one he's thrilled to accept.

The invitation came after James Beard Award-winning chef Deborah VanTrece of Twisted Soul Cookhouse & Pours in Atlanta dined at his restaurant. The soul food maven was easily won over by Scott's classic cooking style and easy charm.

Deborah will be cooking at the James Beard Foundation’s Cheers, Queers! cocktail party June 28 during New York’s World Pride Week. She asked Scott if he'd like to join the fun.

Jamesbeard.org describes the event as ""a talented roster of chefs and personalities at this walk-around cocktail soirée. We know James Beard would be tickled pink!""

Headlining the list of top chefs is Art Smith, former chef for Oprah Winfrey and Florida governors Bob Graham and Jeb Bush. He has restaurants across the country, including Chef Art Smith's Homecomin' in Disney Springs.

Scott said he didn’t believe it was real until he got an email confirmation from the James Beard Foundation, a culinary organization with a mission to ""celebrate, nurture and honor chefs and other leaders making America's food culture more delicious, diverse, and sustainable for everyone.""

Scott especially is excited about being in New York for Gay Pride Week. June 28 marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, which are credited with beginning the gay rights movement.

Sure, Scott has felt the sting of anti-gay bias.

""We all have at one time or another,"" he said.

But because of people like those who participated in Stonewall, he's never been afraid to be himself.

""I love who I am,"" he said. ""I never thought anything was wrong with me. I love someone who is in the same mindset that I am. That's the way I look at it.""

Of course, when Scott gets in front of the stove, none of that matters. He’s doing what he loves, and that’s the only validation he needs.

His father was a food broker, so he grew up around the business.

He’s not a classically trained chef. Born in Hollywood, California, he grew up in Wisconsin and Italy. He did some modeling and landed a recurring role on the Italian soap opera, “La Piovra.”

In the mid-1980s, he moved to Tampa and opened Giovanna’s, an Italian restaurant named after his mother. As the owner, he wanted to learn every aspect of the business. An unreliable chef meant he ended up in the kitchen.

Next came a few years in Tallahassee, where he hosted the television show “Capital Dish,” inviting politicians and local celebrities on camera to cook.

He opened Scott’s on Fifth in 2006. The restaurant celebrated its 13th anniversary on Valentine's Day.

Scott Earick plans to make Key West Pink Shrimp Wontons when visiting the James Beard House in June. (Photo: Submitted photo)

He can't wait to take the Scott's on Fifth show to New York. He plans to make Key West Pink Shrimp Wontons.

""I thought Key West pinks were perfect for a Cheers, Queers! party,"" he said.

He'll tour the city with his husband, Hank Hutson, then he'll come back home to Indialantic. He'll do the daily shopping. He'll place the liquor orders, and do the dishes and clean the restrooms, all the less-than-glamorous things that go with owning a restaurant.

He'll continue to delight guests with angel hair Bolognese, crispy snapper, steak Diane, lobster bisque and his uninhibited joy for cooking.

And, if I'm lucky, he'll continue to be my friend, despite the cost.

SPRING HILL, Fla. (WFLA) - A man accused of dragging a pit bull behind a truck in Spring Hill is now in custody, according to online jail records.

Gregory Tousignant, 58, a transient, was arrested for animal cruelty and booked into the Hernando County Jail at about 9:20 p.m. Wednesday.

According to deputies, witnesses reported seeing a dog tied to bumper of Tousignant's truck by a piece of rope that was attached to the animal's collar.

Deputies said Tousignant was unaware the dog had jumped out of the bed of his truck.

It is illegal to carry any pet in the bed of a truck that is not properly secured and prevented from jumping out of a moving vehicle.

Tousignant’s faces a misdemeanor charge of Cruelty to Animals, which carries a $1,000 bond. In the meantime, the pit bull is being fostered at a vet tech's house and might be available for adoption once he is healed.",https://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/hernando-county/hernando-county-deputies-seek-dog-dragging-suspect/1989307048,2019-05-09T09:17:56Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"
Killer's sleepwalking defense fails to convince jury in Florida murder case,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — After about five hours of deliberations, a 12-person jury on Wednesday found a Florida man guilty of first-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of a 21-year-old woman, rejecting the defense argument that he was sleepwalking when he attacked her in his home.

After the verdict was read, both the family of Brooke Preston and the family of Randy Herman Jr. teared up silently on opposite sides of the courtroom as Circuit Judge John Kastrenakes thanked the jury for its service of more than a week in the case. Before the judge sentenced Herman, 26, to the mandatory term of life in prison, Preston’s sister, Jordan, spoke briefly before the court.

As she tried to stifle her tears, she explained nothing has been the same since her sister was killed. The sisters and Herman had known each other since they were teenagers and lived together for more than six months at the home where she was attacked. Jordan Preston was not in the residence at the time of the fatal stabbing.

“The last few years without her have been awful. Our lives are totally different,” she said.

Outside the courtroom, Preston’s father, John, walked surrounded by more than a dozen family members and friends who came down from Pennsylvania for the trial.

“There’s no winners in this whole situation. Everybody’s losers,” he said.

Herman and his lawyers had argued he was sleepwalking when he stabbed Preston more than 20 times on the morning of March 25, 2017, and should be found not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors told the jury Herman’s actions were deliberate and not the product of an alleged sleepwalking episode.

Investigators said Preston had finished packing up and was ready to move to New York when Herman sent her a text message, asking her to pick up a shirt before she left to give to a friend. When Herman testified last week, he said he thought Preston had come back to the house that morning, he had given her a shirt, then they had hugged goodbye, she left and he went back to sleep.

“The next thing (I know), I’m standing over top of her and I have a knife in my hand, covered in blood,” Herman said. “I was confused. Scared. Didn’t know what to do. Didn’t know what happened.”

Herman then drove to a nearby park, called 911 and told them that even though he didn’t remember what had happened, he said he must have been the one that killed Preston because no one else was home.

Over the course of the trial, which began with testimony April 30, the jury heard from Palm Beach County sheriff’s detectives; Herman; Jordan Preston; Kyle McGregor, the man who last saw Preston alive; as well as from experts who testified both for against the sleepwalking defense.

In his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant Public Defender Joseph Walsh said there was no logical answer to what happened. There was no motive, no history of violence and no issues between Herman and Preston.

“There is no other rational explanation for this killing other than this could have been sleepwalking,” Walsh said.

Dr. Charles Patrick Ewing, a forensic psychologist, testified Monday that he was “truly puzzled” by the case until he learned of Herman’s history of sleepwalking.

“That really made sense to me, because I really couldn’t make any other sense of the case,” Ewing said.

He said while sleepwalking is uncommon and sleepwalking homicides are even less likely, they do happen and Herman met the criteria: The person attacked was well-loved by the attacker, there appeared to be no motive in the case, Herman said he couldn’t remember anything from the attack and he had a history of sleepwalking.

Herman’s mother, Kathi Adams, testified that she had witnessed several episodes as Herman was a child, but Jordan Preston said in the years she had known him and lived with him, she never saw him sleepwalk.

On Tuesday, prosecutors had Dr. Wade C. Myers, a forensic psychiatrist, testify and say that there’s no way Herman could have slept through the 20-plus stabs he inflicted on Preston because it was too complex of an action.

Instead, he suggested the motive in the killing may be sexually based, drawing from an alleged incident the night before the stabbing where Herman reportedly hid in Brooke Preston’s closet naked after a day of drinking heavily. No one saw the alleged incident and it was only known because Preston reportedly told McGregor and asked to spend the night with him.

Preston’s sister testified that there was no sexual or romantic interested between herself, her sister or Herman.

Over the years, there have been several high-profile murder cases where those accused have claimed sleepwalking as a defense for their actions and have had their juries rule both for and against them.

In 2015, Joseph Mitchell was found not guilty of strangling his 4-year-old son to death after his attorneys argued he was sleepwalking at the time of the attack in North Carolina. In 1999, an Arizona man was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of his wife after he claimed he was sleepwalking when he stabbed her and then dragged her to the pool and held her head under water.

During his closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant State Attorney Reid Scott said Herman was not sleepwalking and that he knew what he was doing.

“This is skin, this is bone, this is muscle (he’s stabbing,)” he said. “You’re not going to sleepwalk through that.”

Kansas motorcycle crash leaves Florida man stranded,"PRATT COUNTY — Tim Roush was participating in a motorcycle endurance ride far from his Jacksonville home when an encounter with a deer began an endurance test like no other.

Now he is not only fighting to recover from a spinal injury but to get back home to Jacksonville.

The deer leapt in front of him April 28 as he was navigating his motorcycle on a dirt road in Pratt County, Kansas, while on a cross-country ride organized by the Iron Butt Association, an international network of riders. The resulting crash left Roush, 56, with three crushed vertebrae and other injuries, despite wearing full leather safety gear and a helmet, said his daughter-in-law, Phoebe Storm.

“We are just devastated,” she said.

Their family and friends are seeking public help to fund a medical flight home, she said. Surgery was performed at Wesley Medical Center in Wichita, but Roush will also need specialized spinal cord therapy. His health insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, wants to send him to a Nebraska facility, the closest to Wichita, but the family wants him at Brooks Rehabilitation in Jacksonville, four miles from his home and close to his family, said his wife, Sabrina Roush.

“They have a bed waiting for him,” she said. “This is really hard for both of us. I want to be with him (while he is in specialized therapy). If we’re in Nebraska, we have no one there.”

Toni Woods, senior media relations consultant for Jacksonville-based Blue Cross, said she could not comment on a specific case. But she said that “in general, non-emergency medical transportation is not a covered service. We work with the local care team to assist with coordinating the member’s care and work to find the best solution for the member.”

Even if the insurer approves Roush going to Brooks, the cost of the medical flight likely will have to be paid out of pocket, she said. The lowest estimate they have obtained is $7,500, and others are as high as $20,000.

Roush “still has a lot of pain,” his wife said, and the effort to get transport has taken its toll as well.

“Things are tough right now,” she said. “He’s tired and miserable. We are both exhausted from trying to get him home. I’ve spent so much time on the phone and texting and filling out forms and begging and every turn is a brick wall.”

Roush’s friends and fellow members of the biker community have mounted a social media campaign to help, directing supporters to a GoFundMe account set up April 30 by Brittany Thomas.

On Facebook, Roush urged his long-distance biker friends to get medical transport coverage in addition to their normal health insurance.

Man with week to live has dying wish of getting his 11 rescue dogs adopted,"BEXAR COUNTY, TX (KSAT/CNN) – A Texas man was recently given one week to live. His final wish is to get his 11 rescue dogs adopted.

For two years, 71-year-old Richard Ewers has been taking in dumped or stray dogs. Volunteers and donors also stepped in to help vaccinate, spay and neuter the dogs, repair his fence and adopt the dogs out.

But during that time, Ewers was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Recently, he was put into hospice and given about a week to live.

Mary Oyler and other volunteers with “Save Our Strays San Antonio” have been coming to Ewers’ home every day to feed the dogs, spend time with them and give them water.

""We are all very saddened by this, of course, and we want to make that last wish come true for him,"" Oyler said.

Eleven dogs out of 27 are left since KSAT started following Ewers’ story last year.

Oyler said she’s hoping the final 11 dogs can be adopted to prevent them from being picked up by the county.

""It would add a lot more stress to what they’re going through already,” she said. “Not having Mr. Richard here, there's confusion, there’s loneliness, there's depression.""

Oyler said the conditions the dogs are living in are not ideal.

""There's no one to give them attention and love,” she said. “There is no running water, there is no electricity.”

She said whoever adopts or fosters the dogs will need to be patient.

""All they've ever known is Mr. Richard. So, it's going to require a family that will have a lot of patience,"" Oyler said.

A Facebook page called “Helping Mr. Richard and His Dogs” was created for anyone interested in adopting or fostering the dogs.

All the dogs have been spayed or neutered, but they’ll need to be taken to the vet for checkups.",https://www.wfla.com/national/man-with-week-to-live-has-dying-wish-of-getting-his-11-rescue-dogs-adopted/1988553213,2019-05-08T12:09:02Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"

Accusations of stolen cocaine escalated into kidnapping and torture over the weekend in Titusville, according to police reports.

Two men were arrested and charged with attempted murder and kidnapping. Police said the two beat and waterboarded a man after suspecting his friend had stolen cocaine from them Saturday.

Police were called about 12:30 a.m. Sunday when a battered man was admitted to the hospital, according to arrest reports. He had been pistol-whipped, waterboarded and force-fed dog food.



John Faulk, 27, of Titusville, and Steven Erickson, 24, of Cocoa, were charged with attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and inflicting harm on the person, robbery with a firearm and second-degree grand theft.

After a long day of drinking and using cocaine, the men believed their victim's friend had stolen cocaine from them before leaving to get food, police said. So they restrained the man's hands with tape and covered his nose and mouth with cloth before pouring water over his face, telling him to get his friend to return the cocaine or they would kill him.



They used table legs and a gun to beat him before uncovering his mouth to feed him dog food, police reported.

The torture lasted about 45 minutes before the man escaped to a nearby friend's house and then went to the hospital. Police said the suspects also stole the man's cell phone and over $800.

Matthews did not say what tactical measures were used when arresting Faulk and Erickson at the home.

No further information was available about the incidents Monday afternoon. The case remains an ongoing investigation.



Faulk is being held at the Brevard County Jail Complex in lieu of $115,000 bond. Erickson is being held in lieu of $122,000 bond.

"Dick Tomey, the winningest coach in Arizona Wildcats football history, dies at 80","Dick Tomey, who won more football games than any coach in Arizona Wildcats history and became a legend in both the Sonoran Desert and the Hawaiian islands, has died at age 80.

Tomey's family said he died late Friday night. Tomey, a Tucson resident, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of lung cancer around Christmas. In January, he underwent tests at MD Anderson Medical Center in Houston; he also received treatment at Tucson Medical Center.

""We are all heartbroken to lose him,"" the family said in a statement, ""but are forever grateful to have shared his life.""

In 20 years as the head coach at Hawaii, Arizona and San Jose State, Tomey went a combined 183-145-7. He won 95 games at the UA from 1987-2000, and 48 in a six-season stretch — from 1993-98 — that’s considered among the best in program history. His mid-1990s teams were famous for their “Desert Swarm” defense, even gracing the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1994. His 1998 team went 12-1, beating Nebraska in the Holiday Bowl to cap the greatest season in program history. The Wildcats finished No. 4 in both major polls that year, another program best.

Tomey coached five future first-round NFL draft picks; an even 20 of his Wildcats were named All-Americans. Michigan legend Bo Schembechler loomed large in Tomey’s life; so did author and motivational speaker Tony Robbins, who taught the coach the importance of connecting with people and building relationships.

Tomey had countless connections, and maintained many relationships. He greeted his former players and colleagues with what he called “real hugs” — and kind words.

""To us, Dick Tomey was one of a kind,"" his family said. ""Known for his room-for-everyone big-heartedness, generous spiritedness (to a fault), instinctive kindness, love and respect for people of all walks, and the ease with which he forgave himself and others and moved on with life without resentments—taught all of us so much. Dick Tomey was never petty, never small minded. He was a man who discovered his mission in life, embraced it, enjoyed it, and accomplished amazing things. When speaking of football, he often said, 'Football is not complicated. People are.' He was always, first and foremost, a people person.""

Tomey was born in in Indiana and graduated from DePauw University. He coached freshmen at Miami of Ohio and at Northern Illinois before getting his first varsity job, coaching Davidson’s defensive backs in 1965. Tomey spent four seasons at Kansas before following Pepper Rodgers to UCLA. Tomey coached the Bruins’ offensive linemen and defensive backs, then spent the 1976 season as the Bruins’ defensive coordinator.

In 1977, Hawaii named Tomey its head coach. In six seasons, Tomey turned around the Rainbow Warriors’ moribund program. The team earned its first Associated Press ranking and produced its first-ever AP All-American, Al Noga.

Arizona hired Tomey in 1987 to replace Larry Smith, who departed following the team’s bowl game to become the new head coach at USC. Tomey was torn; he told reporters later that he thought of returning to Hawaii, where he was the program’s all-time wins leader and a local legend, more than once.

Tomey went 4-5-3 in his first season, then posted a string of success rarely seen in UA football history. Tomey posted 11 winning seasons, including a 10-2 mark in 1993 that ended with a Fiesta Bowl win over Miami (Fla.), and the team-record 12-1 showing in 1998. Tomey’s teams were defensive-minded, thanks in part to a “double-eagle flex” scheme devised by assistant coaches Larry Mac Duff and Rich Ellerson. Tedy Bruschi and Rob Waldrop emerged as college football stars during their times as Wildcats, setting sacks and tackles records while earning all-league honors. Chris McAlister, a defensive star on the 1998 team, went on to become one of the NFL’s best cornerbacks.

For every Bruschi and McAlister, there were dozens of undersized players who were the hallmark of Tomey’s teams.

""When it came to football, Dick Tomey had an eye for undiscovered ability, an eye for raw potential, an eye for leadership—and a deep regard for guys who walked on, who sacrificed to play the game simply because they loved it,"" his family said. ""He was never afraid to be the underdog coach, with the underdog team… in fact, he was partial to taking his underdog team(s) in to play the moneyed power schools… and his teams won their share of those games.

""Off the field Dick was a beautiful human being. His was a loving spirit. He was a natural leader, a natural teacher. His gift of oratory was legendary. Nearly everyone who knew him can quote Dick Tomey on some subject. Words were his most powerful tool (even his profanity was eloquent). When he spoke he made listeners out of non-listeners, believers out of non-believers. He lifted, he challenged, he inspired. He could change the way a person thought about life, about the world around him, and the person would be better for the change. His own family is proof of that.""

Tomey preached “the team, the team, the team” and motivated his players with slogans and T-shirts long before it became vogue among coaches. His fierce loyalty to his assistants was unique in a profession that churns through them. Duane Akina served as both Arizona’s offensive and defensive coordinator during his time in Tucson. Tomey lured Hall of Fame coach Jim Young back to Tucson as an assistant coach, two seasons after he was fired as Army’s head coach. Another coaching star, Homer Smith, served as Arizona’s offensive coordinator under Tomey.

Tomey’s loyalty to his assistants — and certainty in his scheme — may have ultimately led to the coach’s undoing in Tucson. The Wildcats were blown out by Penn State in their 1999 season opener, and the team managed a 6-6 record that season. Arizona started the 2000 season 5-1, beating USC and Stanford in California, but lost its final five games. ASU beat the UA 30-17 in what was seen as a must-win game for Tomey; he told his team in the postgame locker room that he would not return.

The “public debate” over Tomey’s decision-making had been too much to bear, he said. The coach wondered aloud if it had to do with his Western Athletic Conference roots, and UA fans’ desire to move past it and into the Pac-10. College football was being taken over by pass-first, offensive-minded coaches, and Arizona’s attack seemed stodgy by comparison.

Then there was “the Rose Bowl thing,” Tomey said — notably, the fact that Arizona hadn’t been to one. Tomey got the Wildcats close more than once. If not for Miami’s upset of UCLA in 1998, a game that was rescheduled due to a September hurricane, the Wildcats would’ve spent New Year’s Day 1999 in Pasadena. In fact, Arizona players had celebrated that year’s rivalry win over Arizona State by posing with roses in their teeth. Days later, Miami’s Hurricanes put a stop to that.

John Mackovic was hired to replace Tomey. The Wildcats broke offensive records behind a pass-heavy attack, but won few games. Mackovic won just 10 games — and just two in Pac-10 play. He was fired midway through his third season.

The well-connected, well-respected Tomey wasn’t out of coaching long.

In 2003, he served as a defensive assistant for the San Francisco 49ers. A year later, joined Akina, his former UA assistant, on staff at Texas. The Longhorns rewarded Tomey with a win in his first-ever Rose Bowl.

Tomey was named head coach at San Jose State in 2005, and went 25-35 in five seasons. Like he did at Hawaii and Arizona, Tomey built the Spartans into a bowl contender.

Tomey moved to Hawaii with his wife, Nanci, and spent time in semi-retirement. He coached Hawaii’s special teams in 2011, and served as an associate athletic director at South Florida in 2015. The Bulls’ athletic director, UA grad Mark Harlan, connected Tomey with the school’s young football coach. That man, Willie Taggart, is now the head coach at Florida State.

Tomey left his beloved Hawaii for Tucson, a place just as special, a few years ago. Tomey was honored alongside his 1998 team during the Wildcats’ 2018 season. He was a vocal supporter of first-year coach Kevin Sumlin. Sumlin, an admirer of Tomey’s, gave him a locker at the Lowell-Stevens Football Facility.

In May, Tomey spoke in a bid to save Pima College’s football program. In November, he addressed the UA football team as part of “rivalry week.”

Tomey was inducted in the Pima County Sports Hall of Fame in 2017.

Tomey is survived by his wife, Nanci, four adult children and five grandchildren. His son, Rich, was a baseball player at the UA and a longtime employee of both the Diamondbacks and Cardinals.

""As a family we rarely talk about how many games Dick Tomey won—we talk about how many hearts he won,"" his family said. ""Including all of ours.""

Services will be announced at a later date. In lieu of flowers, the family is requesting donations to the Dick Tomey Legacy Fund, which has been created through the Positive Coaching Alliance of America. Visit www.positivecoach.org/TomeyFund for more.

Pennsylvania man charged with stealing $5K of music equipment from South Brunswick church,"CLOSE Here's the latest for Thursday May 9th: Trump announces hurricane aid for Florida; Trump invokes executive privilege over Mueller report; more AP

SOUTH BRUNSWICK - A Pennsylvania man has been arrested in connection with allegedly stealing more than $5,000 of music equipment from a church here and then trying to sell some of the equipment to a Pennsylvania music store.

Brendan Wetzel, 24, of Morrisville, has been charged with burglary, criminal mischief and theft of movable property, according to a police news release. He surrendered to South Brunswick Police on Wednesday and was released pending his first court appearance.

At about 10:34 a.m. Nov. 6, 2018, police responded to the St. Mary's Baptist Church on Broadway Road to investigate a burglary and theft. Police were notified that a person had forced entry into the church and stole musical instrument pieces belonging to the church band.

Within an hour of the burglary and theft, Detective Sgt. Michael Pellino and Detective Monica Posteraro alerted local musical equipment stores and pawn shops about the crime, according to the release.

Church leaders provided detectives with a detailed list of the stolen music instruments and detectives asked retailers of to be on alert for any suspicious pawns matching the stolen property.

A few hours later, the Middletown Police Department in Pennsylvania was contacted by a local music equipment store who reported a suspicious man was attempting to sell stolen music equipment. The music store had been alerted about the South Brunswick church burglary earlier in the day, according to the release.

The man attempting to sell the items left the store when police were called. A Middletown police officer stopped the suspect’s vehicle as it was leaving the store and discovered assorted musical equipment in the back seat, according to the release. The driver was identified as Wetzel.

The officer was able to link a piece of musical equipment in Wetzel’s car as being previously sold to St. Mary’s Baptist Church, the release stated.

Wetzel was arrested and lodged at a correctional facility in Pennsylvania. Police recovered and returned all the musical equipment stolen from the church, the release stated.

Posteraro continued to work on the investigation and obtained a search warrant for Wetzel’s electronics. The Middlesex County Prosecutors Office Tech Unit Detectives Ben Klein and Ryan Tighe were able to recover photos taken at a park behind the church at the time of the burglary in addition to locations searched linking Wetzel to the church, the release stated.

South Brunswick Police Chief Raymond Hayducka praised the cooperation of the different law enforcement agencies as well as the business and faith community with recovering the stolen items.

“This case came together rapidly and involved law enforcement from across state lines. I want to specifically thank the Guitar Center of East Brunswick for assisting in recovering the stolen items,"" Hayducka said. “A house of worship is a special place and all our resources and partners were committed to finding who did this crime. It took hours to recover the music instruments and months to follow the electronic footprint to link the suspect to the burglary, but in the end we got him.”

The chief reminded community members that the South Brunswick Police Community Policing Division offers security assessments of businesses, houses of worship, and residences to help improve security. Anyone looking to have a security survey done should call 732-329-4000, ext. 7469.

Dericka Lindsay's adopted mom stands trial in her death,"Grace Smith suffered severe diabetes, and sometimes the 69-year-old's legs and feet got so swollen she couldn't wear shoes or walk around her own house.

In her condition, Smith was weaker than her 9-year-old adopted daughter, the woman's attorney said, and sometimes she asked for help keeping the ""unruly girl"" under control.

Smith never intended or imagined that her attempts at discipline would lead to the child's death, Smith's attorney argued in the first day of her trial Thursday.

Smith is charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child and aggravated child abuse in connection with the October 2017 death of Dericka Chavonne Lindsey, a young girl who suffocated when her 320-pound cousin, Veronica Posey, sat on her as a form of discipline.

Veronica Posey: Woman convicted of murder, sentenced to life for sitting on child

James Smith: Man sentenced in death of adopted 9-year-old who was sat on

In her opening statements to jurors Thursday, Assistant State Attorney Amy Shea said Posey was charged with murder for what she did to Dericka, but Smith was being charged because ""she failed to do her duty as a parent and protect her child from the abuse of another person.""

Shea said that before Dericka's death, the child had threatened Grace Smith and her husband, James, with a knife and a hammer. Smith called Posey over to her Navy Point home, and when she arrived both women spanked Dericka using a belt, a ruler and a small pipe.

When the girl resisted, she was made to kneel on the floor with her torso bent forward over the seat of an arm chair, and Posey put her weight on the girl's torso. A minute or two into the ""punishment,"" Dericka said she couldn't breathe, but Posey didn't move. A little while later Dericka repeated that she couldn't breathe, and Posey got up, but at that point Dericka had already lost her pulse.

A later autopsy revealed that Lindsey had severe bruising on her buttocks that appeared to be the result of severe, repeated beatings. The medical examiner said during Posey's trial that the bruising was the worst of its type she had ever seen.

Shea said the discipline meted out against Dericka ""goes far beyond what punishment is permitted by the law,"" and she noted that although Smith was frail, ""that doesn't stop her from beating that child, and it doesn't stop her from inviting (Posey's) abuse into her home.""

Case unfolds

Initial arrest: Pensacola child dies after 325-pound adult sat on her as punishment

Charges upgraded: State upgrades charges for 2 allegedly involved in child's punishment death

Autopsy: Lindsay had bruising, brain swelling after cousin allegedly sat on her

Additional charges: Three defendants face additional child abuse charge

Audio: 911 call released from Dericka Lindsay death

Smith's attorney, Assistant Public Defender Bradley Rowe, said that Smith and her husband had been caring for Dericka for most of the girl's life and they loved her dearly. But while the Smiths was getting older and weaker, Dericka was ""getting bigger, stronger and more defiant everyday,"" he said.

Rowe said the couple trusted Posey to help them discipline Dercika because she was an evangelical minister who had children of her own, and sometimes she was able to get the 9-year-old to behave just by using the right words.

► Dericka Lindsay death: Parents, friends say girl with troubled home life was happy, bubbly

When she did resort to corporal punishment, the Smiths never thought Dericka would come to any real harm, Rowe suggested. He said the incident involving Posey and the chair happened so quickly that the Smiths didn't understand the tragic consequences until it was already too late.

""(Posey did not sit on Dericka) at the direction, encouragement, recommendation or order of Grace (Smith),"" Rowe told jurors. ""... She loved her daughter. She didn't want her daughter to die.""

Smith's trial is expected to wrap up Friday.

James Smith, who was also charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child, plead no contest to his charges and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. A jury convicted Posey of first-degree murder, and she was issued the mandatory life sentence for her role in the death.

"ECSO: Nine malnourished dogs found living in squalor, owner arrested","A Century man was arrested this week after investigators allegedly found nine malnourished dogs at his home that were chained and caged in sordid conditions.

Melvin Manuel Jr., 34, was arrested on nine counts of animal abandonment and booked into the Escambia County Jail on Monday. His bond was set at $9,000.

According to his arrest report, an investigator was dispatched Jan. 2 to 280 Hilltop Road in Century. Manuel's father, the property owner, showed the investigator the backyard.

""I could see several malnourished dogs that were on chains as well as several dogs that were kept in pens that were filled with feces and urine,"" the investigator wrote in the arrest report. ""Dogs had fresh wounds as well as old scars on heads and backs.""

All of the bowls and drinking water were full of algae, the report stated. The dogs, which were unlicensed and not vaccinated, were on chains.

The father asked if the family needed to contact his son, and the investigator said yes, the report stated. Once Manuel arrived home, the investigator walked with him through the backyard and explained why each dog was going to be taken and moved to a shelter, according to the report.

According to the arrest report, the investigator found the following dogs at the property:

The first dog was a tan, female pit bull mix named Banana Peel. Like most of the other dogs, her pen was filled with feces and urine. Her water was non-potable, and her feet were covered in feces and urine.

The second dog, Angus, was a black, male pit bull mix with scars on his face and arms and he was trying to get through the wires that kept him caged.

Diva was a black, female pit bull mix with ""extremely"" long, unkempt nails.

The fourth dog, Molly, had a puppy with her. Molly weighed 40.41 pounds, but her puppy weighed 4.21 pounds. The investigator wrote in the arrest report, ""No potable water for momma and no water for puppy. Dogs have extremely long nails and feet are covered in feces and urine, because they cannot get out of pen away from it.""

The fifth dog did not have a name, but its living conditions mirrored those of the others.

Midnight Train was a black, female pit bull mix with a ""thick"" chain attached to her ""thick"" collar.

Heavy Metal, had hair loss on his head, neck and back.

Lucille was thin enough that her protruding ribs, spine and pelvic bones could be seen from a distance.

The ninth dog was named Judy. She was taken to the shelter with the rest of the animals.

All nine animals were seized Jan. 2, and as of Thursday afternoon, the dogs remained under the care of Escambia County Animal Services, according to Joy Tsubooka, spokeswoman for the county.

Manuel posted bond the day after he was booked into jail and was released from custody at 2:02 a.m. Tuesday.

NASA is using the same space suits astronauts wore 30 years ago. Experts say that needs to change.,"When astronauts Story Musgrave and Donald Peterson conducted the space shuttle program’s first spacewalk in 1983, they probably wouldn’t have imagined their spacesuits would still be in use on the International Space Station some 36 years later.

Not only are they still in use but the suits, intended to last 15 years, are currently the only ones available for astronauts whizzing around Earth at thousands of miles per hour.

Now, as NASA prepares to head back to the moon, the agency must scramble to develop a next-generation suit or the next American astronauts will be forced to don some hand-me-down, 1980s equipment.

Sure, the suits get updated after six years in orbit or 25 spacewalks, but with outdated technology and only a limited quantity available, the fact of the matter is the nearly 40-year-old suits NASA employs will not serve the needs of future moonwalkers.

The current spacesuits are expected to last until 2028 – four years after NASA hopes to land astronauts on the moon again.But a series of incidents and issues from the spacesuits, like the all-female spacewalk cancellation in March caused by a lack of available suits, suggests the need for change is more urgent.

NASA has known for a while that it needs to update its spacesuits. The agency's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel reiterated the urgency to develop the next-generation suit during a meeting last month.

In 2017, a similar report by NASA's inspector general came to the same conclusion and stated ""the agency remains years away from having a flight-ready spacesuit capable of replacing the EMU or suitable for use on future exploration missions.""

EMUs, or Extravehicular Mobility Units, are the current suits used on the ISS.

Considered to be a “mini spacecraft” in itself, the spacesuit astronauts currently wear to survive the harsh environment of space is complex and requires major modifications based on the user.

""The EMU, of course, is very bulky. It's a big, bulky, awkward suit to work in,"" former NASA astronaut Winston Scott told FLORIDA TODAY. ""But your life depends on it. It is a totally self-contained life support system.""

Since the retirement of the shuttle program in 2011, ""NASA has had limited ability to return the EMUs from the ISS because only one of the commercial vehicles that ferry supplies to the station has the capability to return items to Earth,"" according to the inspector general's report.

""As a result, astronauts are using the EMUs for much longer periods of time between maintenance and refurbishment than originally intended,"" the report reads.

And only 11 of the 18 ""EMU Primary Life Support System units,"" backpack-like structures required to keep astronauts alive when conducting spacewalks, are still in use. Five were destroyed in the Challenger and Columbia disasters as well as the SpaceX cargo mission that broke apart in 2015. Another was lost during ground testing and the last was built for certification only and is not suitable for flight.

NASA has had years to develop a next-generation spacesuit, but a ""lack of a formal plan and specific destinations for future missions has complicated spacesuit development,"" the report noted.

Starting in 2005 with the establishment of the Constellation program, which called for the development of a suite of vehicles to take astronauts back to the moon and beyond, NASA has spent almost $200 million on three spacesuit development efforts.

On May 1, NASA said on Twitter there would be a ""transition suit"" for the first mission to return to the moon that would include modern designs for astronauts to explore the lunar surface. As to what those advancements will be or what the transition suit will entail, the agency is still unsure.

""We’re looking at internal and external options for a transition spacesuit for the Moon 2024 landing with American astronauts as well as options for modern spacesuits for sustainable surface missions,"" NASA spokeswoman Cheryl Warner said.

Possible future spacesuits

On the local front, Florida Institute of Technology academics has their own ideas on how to upgrade NASA's spacesuits.

In 2016, Ondrej Doule, director and founder of the university's Human Spaceflight Laboratory, along with students and team members, won the grand prize for their design of the interior of a single-person spacecraft in the Genesis Engineering Solutions competition.

The ""Wholly Human Integrated Single Person Spacecraft"" could replace the current spacesuits, Doule said. Instead of modeling the single-person spacecraft to look like a suit, the device would essentially become a mini-spacecraft with robotic arms and would have enough room for one astronaut.

Not only could any astronaut perform spacewalks regardless of their body shape, the walks would also be safer to perform because the robotic arms would do all the repairs needed outside of the space station instead of the actual astronauts, Doule said.

Though NASA does not know what the next spacesuit will look like, the agency is casting a wide net in its search.

As part of the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program, the agency is funding 18 studies, one of which includes the development of a ""SmartSuit,"" an intelligent suit designed with self-healing skin and data collection for spacewalks in extreme environments, NASA said last month.

The SmartSuit could be used to travel to other celestial bodies like the moon and Mars, and will incorporate ""soft-robotics technology that allows astronauts to be highly mobile and better interact with their surroundings,"" according to the release.

The $125,000 project, however, is only in the first phase and can only receive additional funding after successful studies and a transition to the second phase.

Scott, who conducted three spacewalks in NASA's current spacesuit, has his own wishes for how future suits should operate.

""An ideal spacesuit would be one that you don't even think about while you're wearing it,"" Scott said. ""So that means the suit would be light. It would fit you, it wouldn't be big and bulky.""

Instead of inhibiting movement, vision or restricting the astronaut in any way, Scott hopes for a much lighter, tighter-fit suit that still protects the astronaut. He also wouldn't mind an ""Iron Man"" version of a spacesuit.

""Perhaps the suit will be smaller and lighter than what we have, but maybe with some human assist functions like some robotics inside the suit to help you move,"" Scott said. ""Like the suits we develop for our military, the super soldier suits. Like the real version of Iron Man.""

Current suits won't work for deep space missions

With the race back on to send humans to the moon again by 2024, why won't the current spacesuits work if they've already been approved to last until 2028?

According to the inspector general's report, spacesuit requirements vary for each mission. A spacesuit designed for the moon has different needs than one for Mars since ""each destination has different temperatures, radiation levels, pressures, mobility requirements, and exposure to dust and debris.""

Though the current spacesuits are sufficient for use aboard the space station, it won't suffice for deep space exploration missions.

""For example, the current EMU lacks the hip and flexibility needed to walk on and explore planetary surfaces,"" the report reads.

Typically, spacesuits are designed with the mission in mind.

Custom-fit suits were made specifically for astronauts of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions. But with the shuttle program, NASA took a different approach.

As the astronaut class grew larger, it became too expensive to custom-tailor each suit to each astronaut. Instead, NASA’s current suits are a combination of several detachable parts that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.

This allows multiple astronauts to wear the same suit, something the agency has done since the 1980s. But that's not to say they haven't come with their own sets of issues.

Past incidents and current issues

CLOSE Astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch were to make landmark history, but NASA canceled it keeping their safety in mind before anything else. USA TODAY

In March, NASA was planning the first all-female spacewalkwith astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch. But a lack of readily available spacesuits aboard the space station prevented a historic event from occurring.

With limited sizes available, sometimes astronauts — usually females — cannot perform spacewalks due to sizing issues with available spacesuits, NASA design engineer Elizabeth Benson said in a 2009 paper named ""Complexity of Sizing for Space Suit Applications.""

This was essentially the problem with the planned all-female spacewalk – both McClain and Koch required mediums, but there was only one on board that would be ready in time, NASA spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz said.

A simple solution would have been making more sizes available, but due to high costs, NASA had to downgrade the options to only medium, large and extra large sizes, preventing smaller astronauts from wearing the suits and conducting spacewalks.

And if limited sizing and quantity weren't already issues, according to NASA, a spacesuit weighs approximately 280 pounds on the ground. In space, it may not weigh anything, but that still doesn't mean astronauts aren't carrying around all that mass, Scott said.

""Its bulk makes it difficult to work in and some of the smaller stature people or some of the weaker physical people can't manipulate the suit,"" Scott said. ""And of course, they may or may not be able to conduct a spacewalk.""

Kathryn Sullivan, the first American woman to perform a spacewalk in 1985, had her own issues with the suit. In an interview with Outside Magazine in April, Sullivan explained how the suit never fit her correctly.

""The suit's knee was a bit above mine,"" she told the magazine. ""Every time I needed to bend, I wasn't bending a natural joint.""

Astronaut Linda Godwin also told the magazine the shoulders of the spacesuit were the biggest issue.

The suits were initially designed to fit a wide variety of both women and men, but that changed after the agency cut back in sizes.

Astronaut Peggy Whitson, who holds the American record for time spent in space, said in a documentary interview: ""As a woman, doing spacewalks is more challenging, mostly because the suits are sized bigger than the average female.""

So why is this a big deal?

As men and women of different shapes and sizes join NASA's astronaut corps, a poorly fitted suit not only prevents certain astronauts from conducting spacewalks, but ""can also increase the effort that a wearer must exert to move in the suit, since their joints are not lined up with the suit joints,"" Benson said.

""Also, a poorly fit suit has the potential to actually impinge on the wearer during motion and lead to a reduction in mobility and risk of injury,"" she said.

In space, astronauts are essentially floating within their pressurized spacesuit, Scott said. Because the suit is pressurized, which basically means the suit is inflated like a balloon, a common problem astronauts find when wearing the suit is the ability to bend their joints.

""Imagine you're trying to reach for a tool in space and you're reaching to wrap your fingers around the tool. When you try to close and open your fingers, your suit is working against you because it's pressurized,"" Scott said.

In fact, since they were designed in the 1970s, there have been more than 3,400 anomalies with the current spacesuits, according to the inspector general's report. They range from a loose boot thread to glove damage, uncomfortable body temperatures and helmet water intrusions.

Such was the case in 2013 when European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano reported water, a little over a third of a gallon, in his helmet while conducting a spacewalk. A similar instance occurred again in 2016 with NASA astronaut Timothy Kopra. Both spacewalks were terminated early.

None of the incidents that occurred during spacewalks have resulted in deaths or serious injuries, and only five were terminated early. But that's not to say a new spacesuit isn't necessary for future space exploration.

""As we go forward in space, we need to figure out ways to build suits that provide the protection that you need,"" Scott said. ""But also that are lighter and more flexible and better able to allow a person to work in them.""

Hoffman said while on scene officers were notified that a 30-year-old Millville man had been struck in the chest by gunfire and driven himself to the hospital. He was later transported to Cooper University Hospital in Camden.

A third victim, a 22-year-old Bridgeton man, also went to the hospital with a left leg wound from the shooting, according to police.

All three gunshot victims were released from the hospital, according to Hoffman.

The two men who were shot told police it happened while they were crossing the street to their vehicles after leaving a party in the 200 block of West Foundry Street.

Hoffman said the victims could not provide a description of the shooter or shooters.

"Marco Island police chief search down to 12, includes local candidates","The recruitment process has begun to find the next Marco Island police chief. (Photo: Submitted)

The first cut in the Marco Island police chief search has dwindled the candidate list from 81 to 12.

Eight of the 12 remaining candidates looking to replace outgoing Police Chief Al Schettino reside in Florida, including a few local candidates.

The 12 candidates are:

Asst. Chief John Barkley, Naples Police Department

Deputy Chief Jerry Connolly, Haines City Police Department

Captain John Crane-Baker, Delray Beach Police Department

Deputy Chief Tracy Frazzano, Montclair (N.J.) Police Department

Chief Anthony Giaimo, Florida Southwestern College Police Department

Captain Tina Heysler, Village of Palm Springs Police Department

Deputy Chief Michael Kreher, Atlanta Police Department

Deputy Chief Stephen McCosker, Ocoee Police Department

Deputy Chief Joseph Penze, Village of Niles (Ill.) Police Department

Assistant Chief Terrence Pierce, Gainesville Police Department

Retired Chief Tomas Sanchez, Hollywood Police Department

Chief Timothy Sheehan, Tewksbury (Ma.) Police Department

The candidates that survived the first cut will now complete a questionnaire before the next round of cuts names 4-8 finalists for the position.

During Monday's City Council meeting, City Manager David Harden said he hoped to have that short list by the council's May 20 meeting, which Florida Police Chiefs Association Executive Director Amy Mercer said was a possibility.

More: Marco Island police chief intends to retire June 15

The vacancy in the department was created in February after Schettino issued a letter on Feb. 21 announcing his retirement.

As more details came to light, it was revealed that his retirement was not of his choosing as Harden had originally requested his resignation after another embarrassing incident hit the police department.

In 2018, three members of the department were found to have had sex on duty, resulting in two of them tendering their resignations and another being terminated from the force. A fourth officer that knew about one of the officer's actions but didn't report it was reprimanded only to be promoted months later.

The woman involved with all of the officers has also announced her intention to sue the city for damages resulting from the negligence in hiring, retaining and supervising the offending officers.

The last straw, however, came when a high profile incident in which a man barricaded himself in his home with a cache of weapons, drawing a response from SWAT, could not be prosecuted due to the involvement of a Marco Island officer.

Despite the State Attorney's Office refusing for years to use Officer Tige Thompson as a witness in any criminal trials due to his tarnished credibility, he had remained on patrol during Schettino's watch.

In lieu of resigning, Schettino proposed retiring from the department on June 15, which was accepted by Harden.

Although Harden had originally believed the department could have a new police chief in place by that date, Mercer said Wednesday that she was not sure whether that would be feasible.

""I do believe they can possibly name their new chief by then but I am not sure if someone can begin that early due to backgrounds and having to give notice for their current position,"" Mercer said.

Once finalists are named, they will be invited to Marco Island for interviews and to participate in assessment exercises.

What that will look like has yet to be determined, Mercer said.

""We will work with the City Manager on determining the onsite process,"" Mercer said. ""Nothing has been finalized or discussed at this point in the process. However, those talks will begin shortly.""

"Illegal slaughterhouse is back in business, undercover videos show","MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - Undercover video taken at a property in northwest Miami-Dade County depicts the brutal methods used to slaughter livestock. The video, taken by the Animal Recovery Mission on Dec. 30, 2018, shows a worker trying unsuccessfully to use a device to stun a pig. The man, seen smoking a cigarette during the slaughter, then appears to stab the pig several times as the animal kicks and struggles violently.

""The biggest rule in slaughter is that the animal is insensitive to pain or unconscious,"" explained veterinarian Heidi Thomas, who reviewed the ARM video. ""And these animals are clearly not unconscious. They're struggling.""

Thomas, a large animal veterinarian, has served as an expert witness in animal cruelty cases in South Florida. She noted several issues with the treatment of the animals captured on camera.

""I believe that's not in accordance with the law at all,"" Thomas said.

The owner of the property in the 13200 block of Northwest 182nd Street, 73-year-old Manuel Coto-Martinez, is well known to both law enforcement and prosecutors in Miami-Dade County.

It was November 2016 when Local 10 News reported on Coto's arrest after investigators said he sold horse meat to undercover detectives with Miami-Dade police on two occasions.

Coto was facing up to 10 years in prison based on the evidence and charges against him, but he instead served just a few months of probation on a misdemeanor animal neglect charge.

""He sold officers horse meat and did no time,"" said Richard Couto, of the Animal Recovery Mission. ""It is discouraging, and it should be a serious concern to all residents in our community. What is going on in Miami-Dade County?""

Manuel Coto-Martinez (right) was the subject of an investigation by animal rights activists.

Couto said his investigators went into the property just before New Year's Eve after seeing groups of people gathered waiting to buy meat. Inside, they also witnessed illegal alcohol sales and Coto himself counting money as someone marked a pig by repeatedly hitting it with a hammer, a technique Thomas said could be done more humanely.

Local 10 News investigative reporter Amy Viteri rode along with Couto and ARM investigators through the area surrounding Coto's home, known as the C-9 basin.

""This is really no man's land,"" Couto said. ""Anything and everything goes in this area.""

The isolated zone off Okeechobee Road on the western border of Miami-Dade and Broward counties has been a known dumping ground for illegally slaughtered animals for years. Couto has been coming here and helping expose the criminal activity for over a decade.

""This is ground zero for horse slaughter in this county,"" he added.

Within minutes of driving down the road, Couto pointed out bags covered in flies containing animal remains. The first one held parts of a calf that Couto suspected had been butchered illegally and the parts discarded along the road.

After that, he found the remains of about five horses just feet from the road. Each time, the animal parts were found in trash bags.

Manuel Coto-Martinez, 73, has been accused of selling horse meat.

Miami-Dade police reviewed the most recent video from Coto's property and promptly launched an investigation based on what they believed was illegal activity. In a police report, they wrote after a meeting with the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office that an assistant state attorney told them he ""did not find any criminal wrongdoing in the animal slaughter process.""

In a subsequent meeting, representatives from the State Attorney's Office told Local 10 News it is possible the video does show illegal activity, but the edited clip from just one occasion did not give them enough evidence to prosecute.

In Palm Beach County, State Attorney Dave Aronberg has on occasion personally prosecuted cases dealing with animal cruelty in order to send a message that the behavior will not be tolerated.

""I've made it a priority to go after felony animal cruelty because the laws are notoriously weak in our state,"" Aronberg said.

He explained slaughterhouses are governed by the same animal cruelty laws as everyone else and are not exempt. His office has been able to successfully use ARM videos to get recent convictions, including a large illegal slaughter case in 2016.

""Judges have upheld the ability for prosecutors to use these types of videos even if they're not taken by law enforcement, because law enforcement can't be everywhere,"" Aronberg said.

He said the video needs to be authenticated and meet certain standards but can provide advantages to investigators and prosecutors who face a high burden of proof trying to make these cases. Despite that, he said he feels they are worth pursuing.

""I feel these are so worthwhile to prosecute that I will prosecute them myself,"" he said. ""Because you can judge a community by how it treats its most vulnerable, and that includes our animals.""

State Sen. Jason Pizzo is a former Miami-Dade prosecutor who has handled cases using video from ARM. He told Local 10 News he is frustrated with the inconsistency with regard to animal cruelty cases. He said if the issue is rooted in the interpretation of existing laws, he will file a bill to change that in the coming session.

Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said it is looking into the issue of Coto selling meat to the public from his property.

The Miami-Dade police investigation into the activity at Coto's property remains open.

Lake County deputy dragged during traffic stop; suspect dies,"- A man wanted on an outstanding warrant has died following a traffic stop and foot pursuit in Lake County. The Lake County Sheriff's Office says a deputy conducting the traffic stop was also injured during the incident, after being dragged by the suspect's car.

The deputy was attempting to take Sean Christopher Bentley, 27, into custody on a felony warrant for failing to appear on previous fleeing and eluding charges.

The deputy spotted Bentley at a convenience store at State Road 44 and County Road 437, but before the deputy could take him into custody, Bentley got into his car.

""Bentley got into his vehicle at which time he began to struggle with the deputy,"" said Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. John Herrell. ""The deputy deployed his taser, but Bentley put his vehicle in drive with the deputy still partially inside the car, dragging the deputy and causing injuries to his leg.""

Bentley was able to flee onto CR 437 but soon crashed into another vehicle. He then fled on foot before being apprehended in the Eagle Dunes subdivision.

""Shortly after being secured, Bentley had a medical episode and EMS was called to the scene.As EMS treated him, he became combative and lost consciousness,"" Lt. Herrell added.

Bentley was pronounced dead at AdventHealth Waterman just before noon.

"DCPS officer, his stepfather face child sex charges involving same girl","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A police lieutenant with Duval County Public Schools who was arrested Tuesday is facing child sex charges for an incident involving a young girl, News4Jax has learned.

As if that wasn't disturbing enough, the Michigan Attorney General's Office said the man's stepfather is facing the same charges -- involving the same child.

Authorities did not release the child's exact age or her relationship to the two men.

Lt. Sean MacMaster, 45, is charged with two counts of criminal conduct with a child, which is a first-degree felony. He was taken into custody on the out-of-state arrest warrant at the Duval County School Police Department. He was set to go before a judge Wednesday afternoon.

MacMaster's stepfather, Larry Orr, who is a registered sex offender in Michigan, is facing the same charges. He was arraigned in Oakland County Superior Court on Thursday and is being held without bond.

A statement from a Duval County Public Schools spokesperson reads in part:

We have received notification that an employee with the Duval County School Police Department, Lt. Sean MacMaster, was arrested (Tuesday) morning on an out of state warrant. The charges are not related to the school district or any student in the district. However, the district is closely monitoring this situation. The individual is currently in custody. Should he be released from custody, he will not have any contact with students pending the outcome of an internal investigation.

It wasn't immediately clear which school MacMaster worked at.

A woman who was at the home of MacMaster's listed address told News4Jax, ""We don't have any comment.""

"Murder charge dropped, hospitalization set for Hendersonville man suspected of killing mother","Brendan Allen, 33, formerly of 441 North Harper Drive in Hendersonville, was ordered by Superior Court Judge Peter Knight Monday to be transported to the N.C. Regional Hospital in Butner for an indefinite period of confinement.

Following a hearing in Superior Court where three forensic psychiatrists testified that Allen suffers from severe schizophrenia, and did so at the time of his fatal assault on his mother in 2014, Knight agreed with the doctors that Allen was incapable of knowing the nature and quality of his actions in a rational and reality-based way.

As such, it was determined by the court that Brendan Allen was incapable of distinguishing right and wrong due to the effects of psychosis caused by chronic paranoid schizophrenia.

By law, his charges for murder and larceny were dismissed by the court and he will be hospitalized for what is expected to be several years.

“We indicted this case in early 2015, but we have been delayed several years now by Allen’s psychological illness and his continued hospitalization at Broughton,” said District Attorney Greg Newman, who represented the state in the hearing.

“The defense experts determined that Allen was insane at the time of the assault and our own doctor at Central Regional Hospital agreed. I have no evidence to refute these findings. In fact, when I viewed the video-taped interview of Allen at the Henderson County jail in early 2015, it was evident to me then that an insanity defense could be successfully argued at a trial.

""Judge Knight made the right call and did the only thing he could do in this situation. Allen’s condition, while better now than it has been in a long time, is still very advanced and the expectation is that he will be hospitalized for many years to come.""

The Sheriff’s Office responded to a 911 call on Dec. 7, 2014 from 441 North Harper Drive in reference to an unresponsive female. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene and identified as Margaret Kelly, mother of the defendant.

Kelly died from stab wounds to her chest. The defendant was located in Florida with Kelly’s car.

Detectives flew to Florida to interview Allen, but he would not respond to questions. He was subsequently transported to Henderson County, where he did talk to investigators.

He gave a rambling, and at times incoherent, statement where he admitted to killing his mother and intended to go to Ohio to kill his father. He was hearing voices and made several references to spirits, Newman said.

Allen referred to his dad as “Satan” and his mother as ”Babylon” and said they were “leaders of a rebellion against God,” Newman said. It is unknown why he went to Florida instead of Ohio following the stabbing of his mother.

Allen was scheduled for transport to Central Regional Hospital later today by the Sheriff's Office.",https://www.blueridgenow.com/news/20190508/murder-charge-dropped-hospitalization-set-for-hendersonville-man-suspected-of-killing-mother?rssfeed=true,2019-05-08T11:47:45Z,Hendersonville Times,"106 Henderson Crossing Plaza, Hendersonville, NC 28792, USA"

Man concerned overflowing manhole could pose health hazard,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A News4Jax viewer is concerned after he noticed sewer water overflowing from a manhole cover at a Jacksonville apartment complex.

The viewer, who asked to remain anonymous, said he took video of the overflowing water at The Commons Apartments. He's concerned the water could lead to health problems for the people who live there, including his nephew.

City records show a sewage overflow complaint was filed on Aug. 27, 2013. Another was filed on Feb. 6, 2018.

A statement from a manager for The Commons reads in part:

""We did not own the property in 2013 and cannot provide comment. The sewage problem last year was resolved. The equipment has been repaired.""

The viewer said he recorded the video in the past 30 days. He believes management doesn't know about a new potential problem.

""It's not true that it's been fixed,"" the viewer said. ""It may have been worked on back then but this is very much ongoing and particularly on the weekend and late afternoon.""

Osceola deputy ticketed in crash that killed man,"OSCEOLA COUNTY, Fla. - Citations will be issued to an Osceola County Sheriff's Office deputy who caused a chain-reaction crash that killed a 34-year-old man in October, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

Deputy Gloria Boccio will be ticketed for careless driving and failure to wear a seat belt, troopers said.

Troopers said Boccio was driving a marked Dodge Charger patrol car around 8 a.m. Oct. 5 eastbound on U.S. 192 when, for an unknown reason, she failed to slow down to accommodate for traffic stopped at a red light.

Boccio's car slammed into the back of a Ford pickup truck driven by Robert Johnston, the report said. The force of the crash pushed Johnston's truck into a Dodge Van, which then hit a Ford Focus, according to authorities.

Johnston died at an area hospital. His family received $200,000 from the county in January as part of a settlement.

Boccio was not injured. She claimed in a call to the Sheriff's Office after the crash that her brakes malfunctioned, but data retrieved from her patrol car indicated she might have sped up before the impact.

After the crash, Boccio was placed on paid administrative leave.

In November, she was reassigned to a role that does not require her to drive a patrol vehicle after authorities said she caused a second crash. In that instance, troopers said Boccio was driving on State Road 417 on Nov. 6 when she failed to slow down and had to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle in front of her, which then caused a crash between the patrol vehicle and a truck in another lane.

A Mini Cooper and a Volkswagen were also involved.

No one was injured. Boccio was ticketed for an improper lane change.

Troopers said Tuesday that the investigation into the fatal crash has concluded and they do not expect any charges to be filed.

Florida man driving lawnmower accused of striking police cruiser while drunk,"Florida authorities say they arrested an inebriated man on a lawnmower who slammed into a police officer’s parked, unoccupied cruiser.

The alleged alcohol-fueled fender-bender in Haines City on Saturday evening caused minor damage to the cruiser's bumper and led to the arrest of Gary Anderson, 68, who police said had a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit, according to reports.

The officer was on a call when he heard a loud bang from inside a store, FOX13 Tampa reported.

Anderson allegedly told the officer he struck the cruiser but denied causing any damage. He also allegedly admitted being drunk. Anderson reportedly had a trailer with a large cooler attached to the lawn mower.

“I’m proud of the professional demeanor our officers showed when dealing with this heavily-intoxicated, belligerent offender,” Haines City police Chief Jim Elensky said in a statement. “It’s never a good idea to get behind the wheel drunk, even if that wheel is to a Craftsman, Massey Ferguson or John Deere.”

While in custody, Anderson was driven to a hospital after he accused officers -- reportedly using foul language and racial slurs -- of trying to poison him with cocaine, FOX13 reported.

Anderson was charged with committing a third DUI offense in 10 years and refusing to submit to a DUI test.

"Man lands 'truly special,' record-breaking tiger shark while fishing off the coast of Florida","NAPLES, Fla. - Mark Stock landed what he said is a record class tiger shark on April 25 while fishing off Marco Island with charter Captain Ben Olsen. The creature measured 14 ½ feet.

The current state record is a 1,065-pound tiger shark measured at 12 ½ feet and caught out of Pensacola waters in 1981. Stock’s shark was estimated to weigh more than 1,100 pounds, but its exact weight will never be known as it was immediately released.

Olsen said he’s caught tiger sharks exceeding 12 feet but “this shark was truly special, and our number-one priority was to get her released in good shape, as quickly as possible.”

Beth Deacy, a biologist with NOAA Fisheries Panama City Lab and head of its shark-tagging program, told Stock that based on this shark’s length in comparison with similar sized tigers, she would most likely put its age between 15 and 20 years.

"Authorities: Man arrested, refused to remove obscene sticker from vehicle","Authorities say a Florida man was jailed after refusing to remove an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window.

LAKE CITY — Authorities say a Florida man was jailed after refusing to remove an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window.

A Columbia County Sheriff's Office report says 23-year-old Dillon Shane Webb was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence.

It says a deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite. The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court.

Officials say the deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part but Webb refused, citing his First Amendment free speech rights. The deputy then charged Webb with resisting and took him to jail.

Cyberstalking of alleged battery victim lands Rockledge man back in jail,"CLOSE And it can happen to anyone Lamaur Stancil

ROCKLEDGE — A judge has revoked the bail of the Rockledge man accused of torturing a woman and keeping her trapped in a dog crate.

One year ago, the Rockledge Public Safety Department charged Robert Carilli, 38, of the 900 block of Cardon Drive, with five crimes based on the woman's recount of her time being trapped. He spent a few weeks at the Brevard County Jail, then posted $60,000 bail.

The bail revocation hearing happened April 23. Carilli remained at the jail Tuesday without bail.

Previous story: Rockledge man accused of sadistic acts against woman

One of the conditions of his release was Carilli could not contact the woman. But the State Attorney's Office said that happened several times last summer, despite the woman leaving Florida, getting a new phone number and making adjustments to her social media accounts.

She had unknowingly connected with Carilli on Facebook when he created a fake profile impersonating another woman she knew, according to the police report. She told police he likely got her new cell number from her Facebook profile as well and began sending text messages. Despite blocking his number, Carilli used other phone lines to continue texting her, police said.

One message sent to the woman included a map attachment featuring her new home.

In September, prosecutors filed a motion to revoke Carilli's bail. The 33-year-old woman who said she was Carilli's captive asked that she be able to testify remotely because she had moved out of state and wouldn't be able to leave work to travel. That request required its own motion and hearing separate from the bond revocation hearing.

""Due to the overall context of this case, to include the overall allegations of prior sadomasochistic sexual abuse perpetuated by the defendant, it would be unduly and extraordinarily traumatic for (her) to appear in the actual physical presence of the defendant at this time,"" Assistant State Attorney Michael Doyle wrote in the motion to allow her to testify via Skype.

The woman said she will testify in person at trial, Doyle said.

A judge granted the Skype request in December. A date for the bail hearing was set for March 1, then rescheduled for April 23.

Carilli is charged with two counts of aggravated battery and charges of false imprisonment, domestic violence and domestic battery by strangulation. Rockledge investigators said Carilli spent months torturing the woman and treating her as a slave.

Carilli's next court appearance is scheduled for June 19. He will remain at the jail until his case is resolved, according to a court order.

I Won’t Let Racism Rob My Black Child of Joy,"In the summer of 2016, I was pregnant and anxious. That July, while I was in my third trimester, police had killed a Baton Rouge man named Alton Sterling while he was pinned to the ground. The next day Philando Castile was shot dead by police during a traffic stop in a suburb of St. Paul, Minn., while his girlfriend and her 4-year-old daughter sat inches away. Reading the news of these men’s deaths brought to mind black children who had died just as senselessly: 17-year-old Jordan Davis, gunned down at a Florida gas station by a white man annoyed by the music Davis and his friends played; 12-year-old Tamir Rice, killed by police in a Cleveland playground as he held a toy gun; 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones, shot and killed by police during a middle-of-the-night raid on her home.

As I prepared for the birth of my first child, I could already see that I would need a plan in order to avoid succumbing to fear. I wanted my child to take risks, experiment and be bold but also knew that black children are often denied the presumption of innocence if their antics go the least bit sideways. Given the highly publicized deaths of black people at the hands of police and vigilantes, how could I teach my child to embody the carefree, messy freedom of youth that should be her birthright?

I began asking experts, by which I mean both professionals who work in public health and childhood development and black mothers and grandmothers across the country who had insight into raising kids. These questions and others would ultimately lead me to write my first book, We Live for the We: The Political Power of Black Motherhood. But even after both the book and the baby were out in the world, I kept asking.

How did they do it? How should I?

I’ve gotten a range of responses. Many mothers suggested finding play and school environments that are intentional about giving black children room to be spontaneous and free, places where families don’t have to worry that their child’s developmentally appropriate boundary-pushing will be misinterpreted or punished. I learned, for instance, about Little Maroons, a Brooklyn-based preschool co-op and after-school program with an African-centered curriculum, as well as Detroit Summer and Sankofa in Cincinnati, youth development programs that offer safe havens for older children. Cat Brooks, a community organizer in Oakland, told me that maintaining structure and discipline at home helps her feel she’s doing all she can to keep her preteen daughter safe amid the world’s threats. City planner Christy Leffall and meditation teacher Shahara Godfrey, both also in Oakland, separately emphasized the importance of families finding a spiritual practice that offers calm and a way to make sense of suffering. For them, Buddhism has been a lifeline.

One of my most memorable conversations was with Kim Tabari, a mother active in the Long Beach chapter of Black Lives Matter who co-founded a social-justice group for children. She said she made a conscious decision not to be an overprotective parent to her 11-year-old son after witnessing the behavior of a friend, a mother of a teenage black boy. After the teenager got into a fight on a bus, his mother forbade him from taking public transit, opting instead to drive him everywhere herself and otherwise curbing his independence. “She sheltered him because she was afraid. I said I’m not going to be that person,” Tabari told me. “I want to be in the habit of teaching him, of being joyful with him, exploring things.”

“You know how people are always like, ‘How’s the little man?’ I’m like, ‘He’s not a man, he’s a boy.’”

I asked Tabari what she did to manage her fears. “We try to laugh a lot. Be silly,” she said. “You know how people are always like, ‘How’s the little man?’ I’m like, ‘He’s not a man, he’s a boy.’” Tabari guards against efforts to hurry her son toward adulthood. The wider world does that too often. A 2014 study found that white women undergraduates perceive black boys as young as 10 to be four to five years older than they are. Black girls, especially those who are curvier, are disproportionately shamed and pushed out of classrooms by school officials who subjectively enforce dress code policies, according to a 2018 report.

Determined to adopt Tabari’s practice of orienting toward joy, I made sure my daughter’s life was filled with music and laughter. When Is was an infant, I’d put her in her baby seat and make up dance routines while I cooked. I’d put on Héctor Lavoe or Beyoncé and hold her while we danced around the kitchen. Now that she can play more independently, she’ll hear a song and stop what she’s doing to move to the beat. She recently asked my mom to play a Drake song she loves. “That’s my jam,” Is told her.

Our family-based immersions in silliness and song sufficed until my daughter hit the 18-month mark. Then I felt the need to get her around other children more often. As we entered library story circles, weekly music classes, toddler programs and playgrounds, I wondered how to help my daughter be joyful and carefree as we moved into the wider world. I needed to know how to prepare my daughter for the discriminatory treatment and exclusion that she was sure to encounter. But she was just learning to speak, just learning to trust anyone outside her small circle of intimates. How to introduce such complex ideas to someone so small?

I shared my concerns with Denese Shervington, chair of psychiatry at Charles R. Drew University in California and president of the New Orleans-based Institute of Women and Ethnic Studies, and she offered two age-appropriate tools to use as Is grows toward the preschool years: explicit limit-setting and storytelling. Young children can be extremely literal, even rigid, when told that something could harm them. Just think of the child who looks at you in horror when you suggest crossing the street against the light even with no cars in sight. Tell them certain things aren’t safe – playing with a toy gun in public, for instance – and younger children tend to listen without much questioning, Shervington said. As they get older, they’ll understand the social context, why some rules apply to them but not their white peers.

A recent NPR report pointed to the power of story as a deterrent to misbehavior in Inuit communities, and Shervington suggested something similar: weaving cautionary tales that scare our kids just enough so they’ll be less likely to do things that put in them in harm’s way – think of the boogeyman that terrified some of us in our youth. But rather than being explicit about potential consequences, we should leave room for youthful imagination. “We don’t have to tell them, ‘Because the police will kill you,’” she explained.

Equipped with specific ways to meet my responsibilities as the parent of a black child, I could be proactive and focused rather than sink into generalized worry and despair. There’s really only so much you can do, Shervington seemed to be saying. Do those things and move on. Don’t let racism rob your family of its joy.

Now, after two years of interviewing black mothers, I understand that simultaneously demanding that our children be allowed to be children and carefully introducing them to the realities of black life in this country are just part of the work. Dancing, laughing and finding pleasure in the small things may be of value to most families, but for black families, engaging in joyful practices is necessary to our survival, to our ability to fully claim our humanity.

On a recent sun-drenched day, I watched my daughter climb a jungle gym, agilely scaling the metal bars to move much higher than I’d seen her go before. She giggled when I praised her and was clearly proud of herself. I resisted the urge to caution her, and she didn’t call for my help until she’d tried and failed a few times to find her footing on the way down. This is how it will be, I thought. I may often see danger and hurt lurking, but she’ll be having fun, unaware of the risks involved as she explores the world. My task will be to stay involved, coaching or warning as it’s called for, trying to stay close enough to dart in if disaster strikes, but mostly giving her enough space to learn for herself how to maneuver this life.

Friday’s Hot Clicks: The Astros’ Roof Was No Match for This Crazy Thunderstorm,"You never want to pull out your umbrella indoors

Parts of Houston are underwater this morning after powerful thunderstorms produced as much as seven inches of rain in some areas. The storms dropped hail the size of a person’s palm and flooded many roadways.

That kind of weather is exactly why the Astros put a roof on Minute Maid Park, but the storm was so outrageous that it had water pouring in through the retractable roof. Fans unexpectedly had to whip out their umbrellas while sitting indoors. And it wasn’t just one crack in the roof leaking water into the stands—the rain was coming in from all over the place.

It's raining at the Astros game.

The rain may have ended up helping to seal a win for Houston. With two on and one out in the ninth, trailing by two runs, Rangers outfielder Hunter Pence hit a line drive to rightfield. It was one of the wettest areas of the ballpark so many fans had vacated their seats, giving Josh Reddick plenty of room to make a slick catch to bring the ball back from over the wall.

“If (fans) sitting where they normally are, maybe a few hands in the way and not able to make that play,” Reddick said after the game. “A little blessing in disguise we had all that rain tonight.”

States call pornography a public health crisis; porn industry decries 'fear mongering',"CLOSE A Michigan man is suing his parents, claiming they allegedly destroyed his massive porn collection. Veuer’s Mercer Morrison has the story. Buzz60, Buzz60

From Idaho to Pennsylvania, lawmakers in more than a dozen states have adopted resolutions declaring pornography a public health crisis.

This week the Arizona Senate approved a measure urging the state to prevent exposure and addiction to porn, drawing criticism from some experts who say the approach is misguided and poses risks.

At least one legislative chamber has adopted a similar measure in 15 states, including South Dakota, Tennessee, Florida and Virginia, and the Republican Party added it to its national platform in 2016.

Linking pornography to violence against women, sexual activity among teens and unplanned pregnancies, Republican Arizona Sen. Sylvia Allen supported the measure.

“It is an epidemic in our society, and this makes a statement that we have a problem,” Allen said.

Pornography: Why, how and when to talk to your kids about it

Resolution: Saying it 'poisons' minds, AZ Legislature declares porn a public health crisis

Some in the adult entertainment industry say blaming pornography for those social issues is “compete fear-mongering,” including Mark Kernes, a senior editor at the trade publication Adult Video News media network.

While the Arizona resolution does not ban pornography production or consumption, the number of resolutions calling it a public health crisis has trended upward since 2016.

Many resolutions are based on a model written by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, an anti-porn group whose members argue individuals can't fight porn-related problems alone.

Although research has raised questions about how explicit material impacts young kids, Emily Rothman, a community health sciences professor at Boston University, said there aren't clear connections to often-cited issues such as human trafficking.

She added the resolutions fail to call for more robust sex education for teenagers while risking creating stigma for marginalized groups, such as LGBT people.

Public health: Sex addictions are deeply misunderstood. A new classification could change that.

Sunshine state: Florida House declares a public health risk — from pornography (not guns)

“If you stub your toe, that might be something you can’t solve yourself, but that doesn’t make it a public health issue,” Rothman said.

Several Arizona Democrats said issues such as measles, opioid addiction, homelessness and suicide deserve more action than pornography.

Some argue porn can even benefit society. Pornography can contribute to a healthy adult sex life, said Albuquerque-based sex therapist David Ley. He described the resolutions as a backlash against changing attitudes about sexuality.

“It’s just virtue signaling, there’s literally no effect,” he said.

The 15 states where at least one legislative chamber has declared porn a public health crisis are: Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia.

Building on those resolutions, supporters may push to prevent accessing porn on publicly funded internet at schools and libraries.

“We think these resolutions are really powerful, although they’re non-binding, because they raise awareness and educate the public, and hopefully can lay the groundwork to make more resources available to those people who potentially struggle with pornography,” said Haley Halverson with the National Center on Sexual Exploitation.

But restrictions on pornography could threaten First Amendment rights, said David Boaz, executive vice president of the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.

“When you declare it as a public health crisis, people see that as a blank check for the government to do something about it,” he said.

Accidental shooting kills construction,"Accidental shooting kills construction Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Video

(WFLA) Florida police say a man accidentally fired a pistol Wednesday, fatally wounding a fellow construction worker standing on a nearby roof.

The house deputies responded to is being remodeled and no one currently lives there.

According to officials, the shooter, who is part of the construction team, said that he had just gotten out of his vehicle and was moving his gun from his waistband to his pocket when he slipped on construction debris and his gun fired.

Detectives explained that the victim was roughly ten feet from the shooter's own son working on the roof at the time.

The 44-year-old victim was taken to a nearby hospital, where he later died.

The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office is investigating the incident as a homicide. The shooter is reportedly cooperating with deputies.

Mid-Ohio Opera Co. taking on Mozart comedy at OSU-Mansfield's Founders Auditorium,"The cast of ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" will perform four shows at the Ohio State University-Mansfield for the Mid-Ohio Opera Co. (Photo: Submitted)

MANSFIELD - Joel Vega wanted to lighten things up for the Mid-Ohio Opera Co.

""We've done a lot of serious work,"" the artistic director said. ""I think people are tired of death.""

The opera company's latest work will be the polar opposite. ""Cosi Fan Tutte,"" which loosely translates to ""We're All Like That,"" will open at 7 p.m. Friday at Founders Auditorium on the Ohio State University-Mansfield campus.

Other shows will be at 2 p.m. Sunday, 7 p.m. May 17 and 2 p.m. May 19. No tickets are needed, though donations will be accepted.

Mozart wrote ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" over 200 years ago but Vega said it felt like a 1970s sitcom when he read it, something akin to ""The Brady Bunch.""

""It was the first major Italian opera I was ever in as a singer,"" he said.

The plot revolves around two men who are in love with two sisters. An older man, sort of the Mike Brady of the show, bets the men that their girlfriends will cheat on them within 24 hours.

In this case, cheating translates to kissing.

The older man enlists the help of a maid, who is dressed like Alice from ""The Brady Bunch."" She encourages the two sisters to date other men.

Dressed in military outfits, the two male suitors pretend they are being called off to war.

They soon return wearing clothing reminiscent of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper phase.

""Nobody's fooled except for the two girls,"" Vega said.

Each man tries to seduce the other's girlfriend.

""All they want is a kiss,"" Vega said.

The cast includes Dirk McCoy, coming from Florida; Andrew Surrena, of New York City; Heidi Kirschenheiter-Vega; Megan Potter, of Virginia; Andrew Potter, of Virginia; and Ariel Downs.

""We've got a lot of folks coming from all over,"" Vega said.

In keeping with the sitcom theme, there will be a laugh track.

Vega himself is sitting this one out as far as singing. He is the producer and is handling stage directing for the first time.

The conductor of ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" is Paul Chandley, of North Carolina. Sophia Pavlenko is the pianist. Seth Morris is the lighting designer.

Vega hopes to pack Founders Auditorium.

""The comedy is delicious. I don't think people expect to belly-laugh at an opera,"" he said. ""Come one, come all. Have some fun.""

A mother's greatest gift: passing down the embarrassment,"Mary Carr (from left), with her daughter, Cynthia Carr Falardeau, and niece Susan Cobb McGowen, at a family gathering in 1979. (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO FROM CYNTHIA FALARDEAU)

My 16-year-old son, Wyatt, has a constant complaint: “Mom! You are so embarrassing!”

To which I always reply, “You have no idea! I learned from the best!”

Which begs the question: Is being embarrassing hereditary?

Twenty-years ago, my mother came for a visit. During that week we laughed, cried and finally resolved many conflicts. The last night, she thanked my husband, Jim, and I, for “The best week ever!”

The next day she died of a massive stroke.

Heaven gained God’s best party girl, children’s advocate, community volunteer and mother to anyone who showed up for Sunday dinner. Finding a way to heal, I vowed to carry on her legacy and begin anew. I quit my job and began my own quest to become a mother.

It is less about what she taught me and more about the mother I have become.

This story begins with semantics.

For example, I believe I am my son’s best advocate. He calls it, “Yelling at my teachers!” Like any typical teenager, he exaggerates. Maintaining communication with his teachers equates to being loud in a juvenile mind.

Cynthia Falardeau (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY DENISE RITCHIE)

In the eighth grade, my Home Economics teacher, Mrs. Uzzle, gave us the assignment to create a piece of clothing. I followed a Butterfield pattern to make a plaid wrap skirt. My mother was infuriated that my seams were not straight.

To avoid the teacher’s review, I wore the skirt to school and earned an A-plus. Upon hearing this, my mother hauled over to Hadley E. Watt’s Middle School and asked for my teacher to reconsider the grade she gave me. To which I say, “Who does that?”

Learning to network was a close second to advocacy. Mom was always the Girl Scout leader. My friends thought she was “cool.” Somewhere between her wild clothes, big sunglasses and platform shoes, they knew that she was all about “girl power.”

One summer, our troupe planned a bike ride through a nearby town. It was a very hot day. The girls asked my mom if we could stop for ice cream. I knew my mom did not have any money. However, she brightly replied, “Yes, I think we can make that happen!”

The next thing I know, we are all walking into a bank. My mother confidently asks to speak to the branch manager. I am mortified by what I think is going to happen. She meets the man, extends a firm handshake and asks for a short-term loan. The man looks over my 10 friends and me, pauses for a moment, and says, “I think we can make that happen!”

Who goes to a town where they don’t live, to a bank they don’t use, and gets ice cream for kids? Later she would quip, “I was just trying to teach you that anything is possible.”

Growing up, especially as a teenager, I would beg my mother to dress “normal.” Somewhere between her belly-dancing phase and mid-life crisis came the influence of J.R. Ewing, played by actor Larry Hagman. Mind you, we lived in a conservative suburb of Centerville, Ohio. This was a long way from the home of her favorite TV show, “Dallas.”

I remember wanting desperately to be invisible when I was in pubic with her. Years later, she traded this look for wearing Birkenstocks with a fur coat. This was only seconded by her exercising in a Mickey Mouse sports bra. Her reply was always, “Life is too short to not express yourself.”

My mother’s colorful influence remains a constant presence in my life. Wyatt recently summed it up best, “A mom is the spirit of your heart.”

Despite my smother tendencies, perhaps he, too, knows my love is true.”

Cynthia Falardeau is chief executive officer of the Education Foundation of Indian River County. She lives in Vero Beach, Florida with her husband, Jim, and their son, Wyatt.

"In Hurricane-Ravaged And Aid-Deprived Florida, Trump’s Supporters Remain Loyal","ASSOCIATED PRESS Supporters of President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Panama City Beach, Florida, on May 8, 2019.

PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. — Ron and Florence Schaffhauser stood in matching orange “I SURVIVED HURRICANE MICHAEL” T-shirts, waiting for the MAGA rally to begin, a Doppler radar image of the deadly storm emblazoned on their chests.

Last October, the behemoth Category 5 hurricane had churned towards this beautiful stretch of white-sand beaches on the Florida panhandle, eventually killing 59 Americans and causing $25 billion in damage.

“We lost the roof ... the living room, dining room, kitchen,” said Ron Schaffhauser, a retired Marine, holding Florence’s hand as the couple recounted their ordeal to HuffPost.

“Our daughter’s house got totally destroyed,” said Florence Schaffhauser, who recently retired from a job at a local Winn-Dixie grocery store.

The couple, who live in nearby Springfield, are among hundreds of thousands of Northwest Floridians whose lives were upturned by the storm, and who are still waiting — over 200 days later — for Washington to agree on a federal aid package to help rebuild their community. It’s considered the longest period of time the U.S. government has taken to deliver an aid package after a storm. (By comparison, President Donald Trump agreed to a relief package for Houston-area residents just two weeks after Hurricane Harvey in 2017.)

“We’re not forgotten,” Florence Schaffhauser said, “we’re ignored.”

Christopher Mathias / HuffPost

But on Wednesday, Florence and Ron Schaffhauser were among a sea of red “Make America Great Again” hats, watching and cheering as Marine One, the president’s helicopter, landed here beside the Aaron Bessant Amphitheater.

There’s plenty of reason to think Trump supporters in this area would be upset with the president. The Florida panhandle has been starved of desperately needed aid under his administration’s watch. But instead most here blamed their problems squarely on Democrats, highlighting the unwavering devotion to the president that many of his supporters still show, over two years into his first term.

“Heavens no,” Ron Schaffhauser told HuffPost, when asked if Trump bore some responsibility for the lack of a relief package for the Florida panhandle. It’s “the Democratic party, headed by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer” that’s to blame, he insisted.

An aid package to the Florida panhandle has been repeatedly delayed due to a disagreement between congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump over how to rebuild Puerto Rico, whose residents are U.S. citizens, after it was devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017.

House Democrats have offered a $17.2 billion aid package to address multiple recent natural disasters in the U.S., which includes over a billion dollars in further relief for Puerto Rico, and significant funds to rebuild here in the Florida panhandle as well.

But the president has been resistant to an aid package that includes more funds for Puerto Rico, whose leaders were publicly critical of his administration’s initial response to the hurricanes. Trump has similarly threatened to withhold funds to rebuild parts of California damaged by wildfires there after representatives in that state were critical of his administration.

Trump has falsely claimed the death count in Puerto Rico — as high as 4,500 people, according to one Harvard study — was inflated by his political opponents to smear him. He has said on Twitter that Puerto Rico’s politicians “are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA.” (Puerto Rico is part of the United States.)

ASSOCIATED PRESS Trump supporters cheer as the president's helicopter lands in Panama City Beach, Florida on May 8, 2019.

On Wednesday evening, as Trump took the stage for his campaign rally, chants rose up in the crowd of “Four more years!” He opened his speech by announcing a 90 percent federal cost share for Hurricane Michael costs, and $448 million in additional federal money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

“No games, no gimmicks, no delays, we’re just doing it,” Trump said of the funding, promising to reach a larger deal with Democrats soon.

The president couldn’t resist a dig at Puerto Rico though, falsely claiming to the crowd that Puerto Rico has already received $90 billion in hurricane relief. It has actually been allocated less than half that amount, and has thus far only spent about $11 billion.

Nevertheless, among Trump’s supporters Wednesday, it was a widely shared view that it’s Puerto Rico that’s to blame for Puerto Rico’s problems.

Beth Thompson, a retired nurse, couldn’t understand why Democrats would want to give Puerto Rico — which is still reeling from the storms — more money. “Why?” she said. “They obviously haven’t done much with what we’ve given them.”

There was an overwhelming belief among the president’s supporters in Panama Beach City that he is unimpeachable, both in the sense that nothing he does is wrong, and that recent revelations about his presidency should not be grounds for his impeachment from Congress.

The recently released report by special counsel Robert Mueller describes 10 instances in which Trump may have obstructed justice by using his authority to interfere with Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Some Democrats are pushing to impeach him.

James Rothchild, a 42-year-old jet engine mechanic for the Department of Defense and a member of the Air Force reserve, stood in line Wednesday at the official campaign merchandise booth, tattoos of both the American and Confederate flags visible on his leg.

After buying a new MAGA hat and two Trump campaign T-shirts, he described why he felt Democrats would never impeach the president.

“I don’t think they have a legal leg to stand on, and I think they need to read up on the Constitution,” he said.

George Gorsky, 64, a retired Air Force veteran from Panama City, described the Mueller report as a waste of money.

“It’s like 12 cops picking up speeders,” he said. “Is that cost effective? I know it’s against the law, but you spend all that money, but for what? It’s the same thing for the Mueller report.”

Another man — a 52-year-old resident of Panama City Beach who asked not be named for fear of being “doxed” or harassed by liberals — said Mueller had millions of dollars to prove that the president did something wrong, but couldn’t.

“You’re one of the best investigators in the world and you couldn’t find guilt,” he said of Mueller. “They came up with 10 points [of obstruction of justice] but couldn’t say ‘You’re guilty.’”

The Mueller report explicitly did not exonerate Trump. Mueller chose to not charge Trump with obstruction because of the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel’s opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Mueller’s report, however, could be used as grounds to impeach the president.

Sixty-one-year-old Randy Liston stood in line before the rally wearing a T-shirt underneath a black leather vest with a “Bikers For Trump” patch. Earlier this year the president suggested that Bikers for Trump were among the “tough people” who would support him if Democrats went too far in their investigations and who could make things “very bad, very bad.” Many interpreted the statement as a thinly veiled call to violence.

“They got no grounds to impeach him,” said Liston, who works construction and flooring in Pace, Florida. “He’s done nothing wrong. That’s the problem with the liberal side of it. They got so much hatred towards this president.”

“If they pulled something like that,” he said of impeachment, “they’d have a major problem in the United States.” Asked to elaborate, Liston paused before saying, “Who knows.”

A woman nearby chimed in: “A lot more of us have … ” but didn’t finish her sentence.

There was a more radical element of Trump supporters in Panama City Beach Wednesday, namely QAnon conspiracy theorists.

As thousands of Trump supporters waited in line before the rally, a gaggle of QAnon believers walked around passing out flyers and Q-branded beer koozies. “Make some noise for Q, baby!” one woman screamed. A whole lot of people cheered her on.

QAnon, or simply “Q,” is an anonymous poster on various web forums, namely 8chan, who claims to be a high-level government employee with inside knowledge of the Mueller investigation. Q, in a series of clues, has suggested that the Mueller investigation is all a smokescreen, and that Mueller and Trump have been secretly working together to expose a globalist cabal of Satanist and pedophile Democrats.

“QAnon is a military operation taking down the deep state,” explained the woman passing out QAnon flyers, who refused to give HuffPost her name. QAnon believers think the “deep state” — namely government officials inside the FBI, CIA and other agencies — have been secretly working to destroy Trump.

Later Wednesday evening inside the Trump rally, a woman named Jennifer Dills from Crestview, Florida, stood waiting for the president to take the stage, a Q-branded bag slung over her shoulder. “QAnon, baby,” she told HuffPost about her bag. “The great awakening. Where we go one, we go all.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-rally-panama-city-beach-hurricane-qanon_n_5cd43791e4b0a6cb31be4268,2019-05-09T12:24:53Z,HuffPost,"770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, USA"

PENSACOLA, Fla. (WKRG) — A man in Escambia County, Florida is facing charges for allegedly not telling at least two sexual partners that he was HIV positive. Both women say they later learned they were infected.

Rasheem Bodiford, 25, is facing two felony counts of not telling a partner he was HIV positive.

According to an arrest report, the investigation began in June 2017 when a woman told deputies she had tested positive for HIV. She filed a report to say Bodiford was her most recent sexual partner. She said she later heard from several people that he was HIV positive, although she told deputies he never warned her.

Another deputy conducted a second interview in October, during which the report states the woman's account was consistent with the initial complaint.

In the second interview, the woman told deputies that an official with the health department informed her in June that she was HIV positive.

The woman said she once saw Bodiford in possession of HIV medication, but she says he told her it belonged to her uncle.

During the second interview, the woman gave the deputy the names of other people she thought Bodiford was sexually active with around the same time.

The sheriff's office made contact with a second woman who said she was in a relationship with Bodiford and was having unprotected sex. The second woman also said Bodiford did not warn her he was HIV positive.

The day after that interview, the sheriff's office spoke with Bodiford, who stated during the interview that he was HIV positive, according to the arrest report. The report says Bodiford contacted someone he identified as his mother, who stated she believed Bodiford had known he was HIV positive since at least 2012.

Mollie Tibbetts’ mother, in her first television interview since authorities made an arrest in her daughter’s kidnapping and murder, asked the public to donate to a cause incredibly important to the Iowa college student.Tibbetts would have turned 21 years old Wednesday. In her honor, family members said they hope individuals will donate $21 to Mollie’s Movement, a fundraiser set up for the University of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hospital’s pediatric and adolescent psychiatric unit.

About two months later, a former Iowa State star golfer, Celia Barquin Arozamena, was stabbed to death while playing a round near campus, police said. “We know about the tragic event in Ames right after,” said Laura Calderwood, Tibbetts’ mother. “Part of what I learned from that is this man had been suffering from mental illness … since he was a child.

"Trump, at Florida rally, mocks 2020 field: 'I want to watch that one' when Buttigieg cuts deals with China's Xi","President Trump riffed on his potential opponents in the 2020 presidential election, making jokes at the expense of three of the current Democratic contenders.

Speaking in Panama City Beach, Fla., Trump said that he hopes the Democrats quickly ""pick somebody"" to run against him.

""Let's start this thing,"" he said.

Trump appeared to doubt whether South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg could handle complex negotiations with economic rival China.

LIMBAUGH: THE HATRED FOR TRUMP IS A 'BOTTOMLESS PIT,' TRUMP FAMILY WILL BE TARGETED IF HE LOSES IN 2020

""We have a young man, Buttigieg. ... He's got a great chance, doesn't he? He'll be great representing us against President Xi of China -- that'll be great,"" Trump said.

""I want to be in that room, I want to watch that one,"" he said.

Trump added that China recently ""broke"" an economic agreement and that Vice Premier Liu He will be flying to Washington to negotiate a ""deal"" after tariffs were imposed on Beijing.

During the rally, Trump also expressed concern that several foreign leaders want Vice President Joe Biden to be president.

Laura Ingraham previously discussed the Politico report on her ""Ingraham Angle"" program.

""Of course they do, so they can continue to rip off the U.S.,"" Trump said of the report. ""I think if I heard that, I'd never vote for him.""

""Sleepy Joe and Crazy Bernie [Sanders],"" he said. ""I'll take any of them.""

"Man accused of hitting pregnant girlfriend, shoving teen","Okaloosa County, Fla --- A 37 year old man faces 7 felony charges and a misdemanor for allegedly hitting his pregnant girlfriend.

Read the press release from the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office below.

""The Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office arrested a man on seven felony charges and one misdemeanor this morning after he hit his pregnant girlfriend, shoved her teenage brother, and displayed a firearm during an argument. 37-year old Dennis Toomer began hitting his girlfriend during an argument at her home on Colonial Court around 12:30 a.m. Two teens pulled her into a bedroom to try to protect her but say Toomer busted down the door and continued striking her. A 15-year old who hit Toomer in the head with a bottle to try to stop him says Toomer then shoved him. Toomer told the group he had a gun and would use it, pulling a 9 mm handgun from his right hip.

"Seminole burglary suspect crashes into patrol vehicle, deputies say","SEMINOLE COUNTY, Fla. - A man wanted in connection with a home burglary on Friday crashed into a patrol vehicle and several others while attempting to avoid arrest on Tuesday, according to the Seminole County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies announced Friday that they were searching for Daquon Atkins after a homeowner reported returning to the residence on Virginia Avenue around 1:15 p.m. to find two people inside the home.

A search was conducted in the area but Atkins was not found, according to authorities.

On Tuesday morning, deputies were on Windtree Court in Sanford when they said they saw Atkins enter a Kia Optima. Authorities activated the lights on their patrol vehicles to get Atkins to stop, but he sped off, hitting his tire on the curb and three other vehicles, according to the affidavit.

Atkins struck a patrol vehicle that was attempting to block him on Windchase Boulevard and continued until he was blocked by a second vehicle at the front entrance of the housing complex, the report said.

He was arrested on an armed burglary warrant as well as another open warrant and fleeing and eluding and leaving the scene of a crash charges.

"Florida sheriff deputy revived with Narcan, 3 others recovering after exposure to drugs","A traffic stop in Florida came close to being deadly.

A Florida sheriff’s deputy was revived with Narcan and at least one firefighter was given the overdose reversal drug on Tuesday after exposure to what officials believe to be fentanyl during a traffic stop. Fentanyl is up to 50 times more potent than heroin.

The Lake Country Sheriff’s Office said one of its deputies stopped a vehicle on Florida Boys Ranch Road on Tuesday evening and found narcotics. Shortly after, the deputy felt ill and passed out, FOX35 reported.

Another deputy quickly administered Narcan -- a nasal spray used to counter opioid overdoses -- and revived the deputy.

Fire rescue personnel arrived at the scene and two firefighters also fell ill. One of them also had to be given Narcan, Sgt. Fred Jones told reporters.

The Drug Enforcement Administration has issued warnings to law enforcement officers and other emergency responders about handling fentanyl, which, along with heroin, has been a major factor in the drug overdose epidemic of recent years.

""Exposure to an amount equivalent to a few grains of sand can kill you,"" said a warning to emergency workers on the DEA website. ""You can be in grave danger even if you unintentionally come into contact with fentanyl. This message about fentanyl could save your life or the life of a colleague, so please listen.""

Massachusetts man gets 17 years in human trafficking case,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

BOSTON (AP) - A Massachusetts man who authorities say forced four heroin-addicted women into prostitution has been sentenced to 17 years in prison.

Federal prosecutors say 31-year-old Duhamel Cassagnol, of Milton, was also sentenced Tuesday to five years of probation and ordered to pay more than $13,000 to the victims.

He previously pleaded guilty to charges including sex trafficking by force.

Cassagnol was arrested along with 24-year-old Geneiva Whaley, of Connecticut, in December 2017. She was sentenced in October to a year in prison.

Authorities say they advertised the victims online and housed them in hotel rooms reserved in Whaley's name in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and Florida.

They kept the women addicted, promising heroin only if they generated income. Cassagnol also beat three of the victims and threatened violence against the fourth.

Report points to need to bolster health preparedness,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - As the 2019 hurricane season looms and as hepatitis A cases continue to soar in Florida, a report issued Wednesday shows that more work needs to be done to ensure the health and safety of residents against emerging infectious diseases, terrorism and extreme weather conditions.

Florida scored a 6.7 on the 2019 National Health Security Preparedness Index, putting it on par with the national average. The report, issued by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, analyzed 129 different measures for each state and the nation. The measures are spread across six broad categories and tallied for an overall score.

Glen Mays, a professor of health policy at the University of Kentucky who worked on the index, said the information is being shared to try to improve the nation’s ability to ensure the public health and safety of citizens during disasters.

“Given that as a country we are facing more of these emergency situations, natural disasters, man-made disasters and more disease outbreaks, so raising awareness about what each state can do and where the strengths are and also where the weaknesses are, we hope that can mobilize some people to take some action,” he said. “That’s the major purpose. Because when it comes to disaster preparedness, it’s largely a voluntary effort. You’re trying to get organizations willing to work together to do their part. And this provides a way of showing where we are.”

The assessment was originally developed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2013. The goal is to attain a composite score of 9, which would indicate a “strong health security level.”

Florida earned a 9 in two categories: health security surveillance and incident and information management.

Health security surveillance encompasses the ability to monitor and detect health threats and to identify where hazards start and spread so that they can be contained rapidly. Incident and information management focuses on the ability to deploy people, supplies, money and information to locations where they are most effective in protecting health.

Mays said the state’s scores in those areas are buoyed by its experiences with hurricanes. “Practice makes perfect,” he said.

Florida lags the national average in half of the six categories and outperforms the nation in the other half. For example, Mays noted Florida’s lackluster performance in community planning and engagement, which involves developing and maintaining relationships among government agencies, community organizations and households.

Florida scored a 4.8 in the category, below the national average of 5.2.

“That’s foundational to everything else you do to be prepared for disasters,” Mays said. “In that domain, we are measuring how well organizations are communicating and coordinating their activities and if they are well-positioned to kind of share information and resources to better respond when disasters strike. So it’s really critical stuff.”

The state also lagged behind in two other categories: health-care delivery and countermeasure management.

Health-care delivery focuses on the ability to ensure access to high-quality medical services across the continuum of care during and after disasters and emergencies. Mays said the state’s overall performance in the category was hindered by worse-than-average nursing home performance and mental-health access.

Mays said Florida nursing homes in 2018 had a higher-than-average number of federal citations for failing to comply with emergency preparedness plans. Moreover, he said, “a larger share of the population in the state of Florida is underserved by mental-health professionals. They are very important in helping people, particularly in the aftermath of disasters.”

Countermeasure management evaluates the ability to store and deploy health-related products and supplies that protect people from diseases and injuries. The average score nationwide was 6.5 out of 10. Florida scored 6.1.

Mays said the performance on the measurement also was due to the state’s relatively low vaccination rates for seniors and young children. Though there is growing controversy about vaccines, they are one of the best countermeasures to keep people protected from disease.

“It’s a problem nationally, but it looks like Florida may have a little more of a problem in that area,” Mays told The News Service of Florida.

The score regarding vaccinations came amid an outbreak of hepatitis A. Florida has had a reported 1,037 cases of the liver disease this year, nearly double the amount reported for all of 2018, according to numbers posted on the state Department of Health website.

Hepatitis A can be spread through such things as food or drinks that have been contaminated with fecal matter from people with the disease. Health officials have urged people to get vaccinated against the disease.

Boating accident victim reunites with those who saved his life,"<p>A South Florida man went to Jackson Memorial Hospital on Wednesday morning to reunite with the people who saved his life last year after a boating accident on Father's Day.</p>

<p>""This one really hit home for me on a personal level because I am a boater and I was out there with my kids,"" Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Lt. Terrance Dolan said. </p>

<p>The accident is a Father's Day connection that Dolan and Jonathan Cruz will share forever. </p>

<p>Cruz was out on the water with his twins and his wife at Elliot Key last June when a nearby boater asked for help getting off a sandbar. As Cruz got close to the boat, someone accidentally turned it on and put it in gear.</p>

<p>""I wasn't behind the boat yet. I was still a couple feet away -- probably like 2 or 3 feet away -- and then I just remember getting sucked in,"" Cruz said. </p>

<p>Dolan was nearby on a boat with his family. He heard the screams, grabbed an emergency bag and headed out to help.</p>

<p>""We took a bunch of dry beach towels, packed it up and then tied it as tight as we could to stop the bleeding as much as possible,"" Dolan said. ""And then, at that time, luckily I had an IV, and I started an IV on him.""</p>

<p>By starting an IV and reducing blood loss, Dolan kept Cruz alive until he could be airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center.</p>

<p>""This injury took place in the water, and so there is a high risk for infection that adds to the insult from the initial traumatic injury,"" Dr. Joyce Kaufman said. </p>

<p>Kaufman led the team that kept Cruz in a coma for three weeks and performed 30 surgeries followed by intense therapy. Though his leg and pelvis were severely injured, the medical team that worked on him see him as a miracle.</p>

<p>""It was very traumatic, even for me, because it was just a lot. I felt very emotional afterward,"" Dolan said.   </p>

<p>""I was blessed,"" Cruz said. ""You know, I was blessed to be here.""</p>

<p>Cruz still has multiple surgeries ahead of him. A <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/swaw6-jonathan-cruz"">GoFundMe page</a> has been created to help him and his family during their time of need. </p>

Body cam released in takedown of man accused of trying to drown his son,"- Body cam video from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office shows the moments they took down and arrested Wilkens Ordena in March.

The footage shows a late-night chase ending in Orange County.

Inside the car is Wilkens Ordena, the man Orange County deputies say tried to drown his own son in a pool in March.

Fox 35 spoke with the toddler’s mother Tuesday.

The boy, Kameron, is doing just fine now.

“That’s what hurts me the most is that he had to go through it. My son is much happier. That’s what I can notice from him, that he is way happier,” said Shantia Warren, the boy's mother.

Deputies say Ordena tried to drown his nearly 2-year-old son because he was angry his father was babysitting him that night.

After family members rescued the boy from the pool, Ordena drove off, crashed into deputies’ vehicles and kept going until the moments shown in the body cam footage.

Deputies work hard to get Ordena out of the car, but he won’t budge.

They’re forced to smash open his windows just to open the door and drag him out of the car.

“Karma don’t show up when you want her to, but she do show up that’s what I can say,” Warren said. “I can’t believe it. I can’t. But every day that I wake up, my son is still with me. That’s what makes my tears go away, but it still hurts.”

Ordena is still locked up in Orange County. He’s due back in court in July.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/body-cam-released-in-takedown-of-man-accused-of-trying-to-drown-his-son,2019-05-08T02:24:28Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA"
Thief caught on camera burglarizing cupcake shop in Miramar,"MIRAMAR, Fla. - A cupcake shop owner has only been in business for a little over a year, but she told Local 10 News she is now out close to $1,000 after a thief broke into her shop over the weekend after she had closed for the day.

Surveillance video outside Sweetgem Cupcakes in Miramar shows the moments a crook is seen popping the lock on the front door before making his way inside the business.

The owner, Jessica Castro, said she closed her doors just after 6 p.m. Saturday.

""I looked at my phone and I saw the person on my cameras -- a guy inside here,"" Castro said.

The video shows the thief making his way behind the counter, breaking into a petty cash box and then making away with two tablets, disregarding surveillance cameras watching his every move.

""My door is locked. Everyone's been knocking today,"" Castro said. ""Yeah, it's scary.""

Castro said the man had come in to her shop just an hour before the break-in. She said he never made a purchase, but was just looking around, almost as if to see what he could come back for and steal when she left.

""He says, 'Oh, I just wanted to see what you sold,'"" Castro said.

Miramar police are seen in the video responding to Castro's security alarm, but the thief had already made his getaway.

Anyone with information about the thief's identity is asked to call Broward Crime Stoppers at 954-493-8477.

Passengers from plane that landed in Florida river recall troubled flight,"The last time Katherine Helms flew home she had gone into premature labor. She was having contractions. She had to be medevaced off Cuba.

That trip had a happy ending. Her pregnancy went to full term. Her first child, Wyatt, was born healthy in her hometown of Dublin, Ga. The Helms family returned to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, where she’s an assistant to the base commander and her husband does security work.

Three months later on May 3, they are flying back home to visit family, this time on a Boeing 737-800. This time with the 27-year-old mother sitting in a window seat near the back of the plane, their baby on her lap. Her husband, Donald, is next to them.

For the passengers, Miami Air flight 293 had been trouble from the start. Chartered by the U.S. Department of Defense, a plane flies each Friday from Cuba to Jacksonville. A mix of military and civilians are on this Friday flight, a flight delayed by more than four hours, a flight without air, a flight dodging storms.

Wyatt started the flight wearing a navy blue onesie with a brown puppy dog on the front. But it is hot on the plane, so hot the Helmses strip Wyatt down to his diaper.

Katherine keeps the baby cool and calm by wiping his body with towels soaked in ice water. The flight attendants keep bringing more chilled towels to Row 24.

Farther up the plane, excessive heat lulls Tyler Hall to sleep in Row 10. Sweat pools on his forehead and is dripping down his face. He wakes, his clothes are damp.

Riding in a plane with no air conditioning is worse than Hall expected when he and 135 other passengers boarded the Boeing 737 in Guantanamo Bay for a flight to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, the first of many legs to get the 31-year-old and his father, Randy, home to Amarillo, Texas.

The Halls were in Cuba preparing to bid to renovate a playground on the base.

Over in an exit row, Randy Hall, 61, sits by the window, cajoling the two strangers next to him into a game of pretend fishing. What’s the point of complaining, he tells them, “If we were on a boat fishing and it’s 90 degrees, this wouldn’t be a problem.”

And so they pass the time talking about sports and the imaginary fish they were failing to land in the blazing heat.

Chris La Rue, 32, sits in the aisle seat of Hall’s row. He’s a civilian employee who spent a week in Guantanamo meeting with the public works department. For him, Jacksonville is the final destination.

It’s past 9 p.m. Friday when the plane finally begins its descent to the Westside of Jacksonville.

The Helmses put Wyatt back in his onesie.

Tyler Hall pulls out his phone to text his wife, Alyson — just as he normally does when he flies as a contractor:

On final. Completely saturated in sweat. Dripping off my forehead.

In the cockpit, the pilots of Flight 293 talk to air traffic control about the weather — lightning and heavy rain to the east and west of the airfield — and raise the possibility of switching runways.

The air traffic controller says: “Biscayne 2-9-3, just talked to Navy Jax Tower. He said both runways look pretty bad.”

He later suggests to the pilots switching to Runway 10.

“Yeah, go ahead, let’s do it.” the pilot says.

A strong tail wind pushes the jet to a speed of about 200 mph. It touches down on the east-west runway, bouncing hard, tilting, swerving, zipping past buildings way too fast.

Back in the cabin, Randy Hall looks out the window. It’s covered in mud and grass.

“We’re off the runway,” he says.

Tyler Halls braces himself.

Katherine Helms folds herself around her baby as best she can.

“Oh my God is this it?” La Rue thinks ”...What are we going to hit? Are you going to hit a building? Are we going to hit a pole?”

The Boeing hits a seawall made of loose rocks. One passenger said it sounded like an explosion.

Passengers fly forward, some hitting the seats in front of them. They slam back.

Overhead bins open. Belongings fly through the air. Oxygen masks drop.

Tyler Hall feels water — like a bucket full has been dumped on him.

Helms looks out the window and turns to her husband. “Baby, we’re in the water.”

• • •

It’s dark and wet.

Wyatt, the plane’s youngest passenger, cries in a way his parents have never heard. Is he scared? Is he in pain? Katherine Helms sees a knot forming on the left side of his head.

From somewhere, a dog barks.

Someone shouts: “Jet fuel.”

There’s a smell in the air and momentary panic. People worry if the wetness they feel is jet fuel.

It’s water.

“Get your life vests,” Tyler Hall hears. People ask if a medic is on board.

Tyler Hall’s dad is unconscious.

“Clear the aisle. Coming through,” someone shouts.

A physician’s assistant hunches over Randy Hall urging him to sit still as he wakes so pressure can be applied to the slice down his face.

No time for that, Randy Hall thinks.

“I’ve got to open this door,” he says. He’s a passenger in an exit row. He has a job to do.

And so he opens the door. Adrenaline, he says, is an amazing thing. He crawls through the opening and steps out onto the right wing of the plane.

Tyler Hall grabs his phone again and texts his wife:

I’m ok. Dads ok. Plane not. I’ll update.

Outside is a rush of wind, lightning and driving rain. Blood pools at Randy Hall’s feet as he balances on the wing, reaching through the small door helping others out.

“Go to the end,” he tells them.

One by one, they line the plane’s wing.

He doesn’t know if they are in 100 feet of water or four feet. He doesn’t know if the plane is stable or if it’s going to sink.

On the other wing someone yells: “Watch out! Watch out.”

A passenger shuffles by cradling an 8-month-old baby.

“Baby coming through. Baby coming through,” Tyler Hall hollers. A woman echoes the words.

Tyler Hall receives a succession of texts from his wife in Texas:

What.....

What do you mean....

Tyler

That’s not ok

They have a 5-year-old son and she is 9 months pregnant.

We crashed on landing, Tyler Hall responds.

Are you on the ground? she texts back.

Yes on the wing

As long as you two are safely on the ground I won’t freak out, she responds.

• • •

Tyler Hall looks across the water and sees about a half a dozen emergency vehicles near the runway.

A rescue worker swims toward the wing. The scent of jet fuel is in the air.

Remarkably, there is no rush of madness to get on board the life rafts, perhaps because so many of those on the plane are current or former military members. Many opt to stay on the wing, illuminated by flashes of lightning.

“Woman and children first,” someone calls out.

“No, you go. I’m fine,” Randy Hall hears someone say.

Katherine Helms boards the raft with Wyatt. The paddles are tucked on the outside. Hands fumble trying to find them. They can’t. So the escaping passengers reach into the water and use their hands.

They aren’t making progress, so Helms hands Wyatt to someone she knows and hops overboard, tugging the life raft toward the shore now lined with firemen. Some grab the raft.

Dozens of first responders from the Navy, the city’s fire and sheriff’s offices and state agencies are quickly on the scene. Some jump in the river, fighting the current as they swim toward the passengers.

• • •

The 136 passengers are taken to a hangar at the base. Names are called out. Injuries assessed. A stranger asks Randy Hall if he has contacted family back home.

He hasn’t. The stranger hands him his phone. Go ahead, he says.

Tyler Hall sees the pilot. He appears rattled.

Hall sees him grab a phone and hears him say he can retire in peace. Nobody was severely injured. Nobody died.

Tyler Hall catches a ride in an ambulance with his father and another man. They head to St. Vincent’s Medical Center, where rooms have been cleared.

The hospital is prepared for the worst. Staff responds quickly.

Randy Hall needs nine stitches. He and his son leave wearing St. Vincent’s scrubs to replace their wet clothes.

All told, 22 people are sent to seven Jacksonville-area hospitals for treatment.

Baby Wyatt goes to two of them.

At Orange Park Medical Center, a CT scan shows bleeding on his brain. Wyatt is transferred to Wolfson Children’s Hospital in downtown Jacksonville, where he is kept overnight for observation.

By 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, he is OK to leave. Doctors tell his parents to watch for signs of swelling, seizures or abnormal behavior.

La Rue returns home to Jacksonville’s Southside.

Tyler and Randy Hall hop in a rental car and head to Jacksonville International Airport for an early morning flight to Dallas. At the airport, Randy runs into one of the passengers he had passed the time with on the hot flight.

“I was wondering what happened to you,” the former seat mate says. They embrace.

About an hour into the flight to Dallas-Fort Worth, the sky is a brilliant pallet of orange and pink. Tears rush over Randy Hall’s eyes.

This Sunday, more than anything, they’ll be mindful of what they have and what they could have lost.

The first modern Zane's Trace Commemoration was in 1973,"For several years Zanesville hosted an annual three day festival, the first of which was held in 1973.

A Times Recorder article dated 3-29-1973 stated: “The Zane’s Trace Commemoration will be held Friday, Saturday and Sunday, June 15, 16 and 17, and will feature all elements of transportation from 1796 to 1926, plus a giant parade to be held 10 a.m. on Saturday, June 16. Many special units have been secured for the parade, which will be followed by dedication ceremonies for the National Road-Zane Grey Museum at 1:30 p.m. June 16.”

The celebration was named for the mail route that Ebenezer Zane carved through the forested lands between Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia) and Maysville, Kentucky. Local historian Norris Schneider commented: “Col. Ebenezer Zane blazed the first road in Ohio in 1797. Growth of Zanesville, - the largest city on Zane’s Trace, was stimulated by the Trace, the river transportation, the National Road and later railroad lines from all directions. Zane’s Trace was chosen to symbolize the city’s transportation history for the first annual festival.”

On June 1 the TR announced a calliope would be played at the Commemoration: “Colonel Bob ‘Smiley’ Corbin played a calliope for Ringling Brothers - Barnum and Bailey Circus - one of the world’s greatest - years ago.

“He’ll be playing his own calliope during the coming Zane’s Trace Commemoration, both in the parade down Main Street and on the canal bank area near the Y Bridge. It could very well be the first many area children or even youths have ever heard and it will be well worth listening to because there’s no other sound quite like it.”

Also on June 1, TR readers learned there would be a flea market at the event. The caption below a picture stated: “Mrs. Robert Crown and Mrs. Glen Gardner are shown preparing a huge assortment of merchandise for the mammoth flea market to be held June 15 through 17 during the Zane’s Trace Commemoration. The market will be located on property owned by Ballas Egg Products and Morrison Auto Dealers.”

On June 4 the TR let its readership know that the festival would feature an art show: “Fifty-five artists and craftsmen are scheduled to participate in the professional division of the Zane’s Trace Art Festival…

“The professionals, who are coming from Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Virginia, and Florida as well as from throughout Ohio, will comprise one part of a five-section craft show. Other divisions are historical arts and crafts, needlework, hobby craft and children’s art.”

The next day readers learned a booklet was available for anyone wanting a keepsake: “The official Zane’s Trace Commemoration souvenir booklet containing all information about the Commemoration, a story about Zane’s Trace and other Zanesville historic elements, is now on sale at the Zanesville Area Chamber of Commerce, plus selected stores and businesses.”

On Sunday there would be a special musical event: “The three day…celebration will be capped in the Putnam area at 4 p.m. Sunday, June 17, when the Thursday Music Club’s 40 - voice mixed chorus will sing historical and folk ballads at the Putnam Presbyterian Church on Woodlawn Avenue.

“Sponsored by the Pioneer and Historical Society, the Chorus will sing early hymns and chants of the Ohio Territory, folk-songs, patriotic songs, and Muskingum Valley favorites.”

On June 10 the TR announced the Pioneer and Historical Society would also sponsor another event: “The Pioneer and Historical Society will hold an old fashioned ice cream social on ‘Zane Trace Commemoration Eve’ from 6 to 8 p.m., Thursday, June 14, in the garden of the Dr. Increase Matthews house in Putnam. Anne Grimes will sing from the front stoop of the house at 8 p.m., accompanying herself on her homemade dulcimer.”

From the TR on June 12th readers learned that a local man had built a log cabin for the occasion: “Mike Scott of Erin Place off Dresden Road built a log cabin which will be carried on a float in the Zane Trace Commemoration Parade Saturday. Scott, who is a house builder, plans to take the cabin home after the festivities as a playhouse for his children.”

A special visitor was on hand for the festivities. Romer Grey of Pasadena, California, the oldest son of Zanesville native author Zane Grey, was here for the dedication of the National Road-Zane Grey Museum.

The parade was probably the showcase of the three - day event: “The mile - long, two - hour Zane’s Trace Commemoration parade, scheduled to start at 10 a.m. Saturday, promises to be one of the biggest and most elaborate held in this area during the past 20 years.

“The parade will form at 9:30 a.m. in the staging area located in the Underwood Urban Renewal section north of Interstate 70, Robert Nicholas, parade marshal, announced.”

There was an award sponsored by the Zanesville Rotary Club for the best marching band or float: “The name of the winner each year will be inscribed on the 4 ½ - foot - high trophy which will be on permanent display in the Chamber of Commerce office at 17 North Fourth Street.” (TR, 6-15-’73.)

According to the TR, “The skies threatened rain but held off long enough yesterday for an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 persons to watch one of the most spectacular parades held in Zanesville since the end of World War II.”

The TR proclaimed the festival was an unqualified success: “The Greater Zanesville Community is basking in a bubbly spirit of good - will and happiness in the midst of its celebration on the Zane’s Trace Commemoration which is going very successfully.”

The three - day spectacle ended with a dance: “The Zane’s Trace Commemoration has now gone down in history, with Zanesville’s own Sy Oliver and his orchestra capping the three - day spectacle with a dance at Lind Arena last night,” proclaimed a TR article dated June 18th. “It was estimated that upwards of 200,000 persons, including out - of - town throngs along with area residents, attended the three day celebration.”

Lewis LeMaster is a retired school teacher of the Zanesville area.

NBA Draft 2019: Predicting Biggest Winners in 1st-Round Mock Draft,"Mary Altaffer/Associated Press

The New York Knicks are hoping and praying that the pain of their 17-65 season will disappear May 14 in the NBA's draft lottery.

The Knicks don't have a better chance of winning that lottery than the Cleveland Cavaliers or the Phoenix Suns, even though those two teams finished with 19-63 records.

The lottery system used by the NBA this season gives the teams with the three worst records an equal chance to win the lottery.

Those three teams each have a 14.0 percent chance of coming away with the No. 1 pick and a 52.1 percent chance of coming away with a pick in the top four.

Each team that did not make the playoffs has a chance to win the lottery, and here's a look at this year's odds, per Tankathon.com.

Team, Regular-Season Record, Top-4 pick pct., No. 1 pick pct.

New York Knicks, 17-65, 52.1%, 14.0%

Cleveland Cavaliers, 19-63, 52.1%, 14.0%

Phoenix Suns, 19-63, 52.1%, 14.0%

Chicago Bulls, 22-60, 48.0%, 12.5%

Atlanta Hawks, 29-53, 42.1%, 10.5%

Washington Wizards, 32-50, 37.2%, 9.0%

New Orleans Pelicans, 33-49, 26.3%, 6.0%

Dallas Mavericks, 33-49, 26.3%, 6.0%

Memphis Grizzlies, 33-49, 26.3%, 6.0%

Minnesota Timberwolves, 36-46, 13.9%, 3.0%

Los Angeles Lakers, 37-45, 9.4%, 2.0%

Charlotte Hornets, 39-43, 4.8%, 1.0%

Miami Heat, 39-43, 4.8%, 1.0%

Sacramento Kings, 39-43, 4.8%, 1.0%

For the sake of this mock draft, we are making the assumption that the team with the worst record will end up with the No. 1 pick.

Here's a look at a draft and the three teams that should come away as big winners on draft night.

Zion Williamson, New York Knicks

The Knicks have been languishing for years. Historically speaking, the Knicks have not been on top in the league since winning the 1973 NBA championship.

Recently, they have made the playoffs just three times in the last 14 years. They need a springboard to success, and winning the draft lottery will allow them to get the No. 1 pick and use it on Duke superstar Zion Williamson.

While he played just one season with the Blue Devils, Williamson was a dominant player. Not just with his numbers—22.6 points and 8.9 rebounds—but the way he attacked the game and the opposition. Williamson is a 6'7"", 285-pound force, and he can overpower nearly any opponent.

However, Williamson is more than just a strong man. He is a brilliant leaper who can run the court, and he is a skilled basketball player. While he needs to work on his jump shot, he is the kind of player who can help turn a team around.

The Knicks also have maneuverability under the salary cap, so the drafting of Williamson and adding one or two big-time free agents could help improve the franchise dramatically.

Jarrett Culver, Chicago Bulls

The Bulls have been struggling in recent years, as the post-Michael Jordan era has largely been disappointing for them.

They have failed to make the playoffs in three of the past four years, and while they had a decent run during the Tom Thibodeau era, they are a team that needs a strong young player who excels at both ends of the floor.

That appears to be Culver, who was brilliant for the Texas Tech Red Raiders in their run to the NCAA title game. He has the ability to get it done on both ends of the court.

The 6'5"", 195-pound Culver averaged 18.5 points and 6.4 rebounds per game, and he excelled throughout the tournament with his ability to get in the passing lanes, come up with steals and create scoring opportunities.

Culver showed significant improvement last season after studying elite players.

""Watching some of the greatest players has improved my game a lot,"" said Culver, per Ben Golliver of the Washington Post. ""I added my mid-range, post-up game, jabs and stuff this year. That's from watching a lot of Jayson Tatum, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan. There's a lot to improve on.""

Culver would give the Bulls a complete player, and he could turn into a leader for a team with a number of talented young players in Lauri Markkanen, Zach Lavine and Wendell Carter Jr.

Brandon Clarke, Minnesota Timberwolves

The power forward from Gonzaga has been climbing the draft boards after a series of strong performances in the NCAA tournament.

His ability to show off his power leaping skills with excellent body control has helped him take over games. While teammate Rui Hachimura has been Gonzaga's best player, Clarke has demonstrated an improved shooting touch and the ability to assert himself when the game is on the line.

The 6'8"", 215-pound Clarke averaged 16.9 points and 8.6 rebounds per game this season, and he has the kind of athleticism that translates well to the NBA. He is the type of player that will help the Timberwolves improve significantly.

Clarke was at his best in the second round of the NCAA Tournament when he scored 36 points in Gonzaga's win over Baylor, connecting on 15 of 18 shots from the field.

Clark impressed Baylor head coach Scott Drew with his performance. ""There's a reason he's on the draft board,"" Drew said, per Lindsay Schnell of USAToday.com. ""I was a little surprised, I thought we could block him out a little bit better but man, he really has a quick jump.""

That ability could help the Timberwolves quite a bit in the 2019-20 season.",https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2835539-nba-draft-2019-predicting-biggest-winners-in-1st-round-mock-draft,2019-05-11T13:00:00Z,Bleacher Report,"153 Kearny St, San Francisco, CA 94108, USA"

ACCORDING TO THE RUTGERS CENTER FOR AMERICAN WOMEN IN POLITICS, VOTER TURN OUT FOR WOMEN HAS OUT PACED MEN IN EVERY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE 1980, AND THEY VOTED AT HIGHER RATES IN THE 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS AS WELL. ALL AGE GROUPS SAW A BOOST IN NUMBERS, BUT TURN OUT INCREASED THE MOST AMONG WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18-24. SHE IS A SENIOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, AND ALLISON IS A JUNIOR AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. NICE TO HAVE YOU. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF POLITICALLY? >> SURE. SO I AM A REGISTERED REPRESENT, BUT I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO DEFINE MYSELF AS MORE OF A MILLENNIAL DEFINITION OF THAT.

BUT IF THERE IS ONE PERSON THAT CAN PUSH THE PARTY TO THE RIGHT, THEN THERE IS ONE THAT CAN PUSH IT MORE TOWARD THE LEFT, AS WE WANT TO SEE. SOLEDAD: ALLISON, YOU ARE A JUNIOR, YOU HAVE FOCUSED A LOT ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN. WHERE ARE YOU? >> I AM A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT.

BUT IT IS ABOUT GETTING THE WOMEN IN THE FIRST PLACE TO RUN. ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS PEOPLE DON'T RUN, THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE THEM UP THERE. FOR ME IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO SEE A WOMAN BE AT THE TOP OF A CONTINGENT JUST BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION TO HAVE THAT CHANCE AND SAY I COULD DO THAT TOO ONE DAY. SOLEDAD: WHEN YOU THINK THAT WE ABOUT THIS HISTORY? HOW DO YOU VIEW IT? >> IT SPEAKS TO WHAT OUR NATION IS. WOMEN WHO IS SUCCESSED IN WHAT THEY EP INTENDED TO DO. BUT IT IS A CHANCE TO REFLECT ON HOW WE CAN DO BETTER. THAT IS WHAT GETS LOST IN A LOT OF THE MILLENNIAL CONVERSATION. WE ARE ANGRY AND WE WANT TO RADICALIZE THE SYSTEM.

"Lars Sullivan Apologizes for History of Racist, Sexist and Homophobic Remarks","WWE wrestler Lars Sullivan has apologized for making a slew of racist, sexist, homophobic and otherwise offensive posts on a message board over the course of six years.

Posts from two Bodybuilding.com accounts apparently belonging to Sullivan (real name Dylan Miley) were first discovered in November, shortly after WWE began teasing his main-roster debut, and additional posts were unearthed this week by a Reddit user. The messages were posted between 2007 and 2013 under the usernames “Disenfranchised” and “ElPerfecto.” Both profiles include photos of a younger Miley.

The first comments to be resurfaced include a crass, sexual remark about WWE executive Stephanie McMahon, a crack about another user’s race and a homophobic insult about Chargers quarterback Phillip Rivers. In another post Miley says, “there is a grey area when it comes to the definition of rape.”

Miley’s comments received additional scrutiny this week after Reddit user “FarceVacant” rounded up several more message board posts in which Miley disparages Muslims, Hispanics and various WWE wrestlers.

“They should be demonized for their religion,” Miley wrote in a thread about Muslims. “They are violent and have a violent agenda against America.”

“Not be racist, but it seems like white people are more willing to take responsibility of their own lives than blacks and Hispanics, who are all for government hand outs,” another comment reads.

Miley also said that WWE colleagues Kofi Kingston and R-Truth “look like they could be in a prison black gang.”

Big E, who teams with Kofi as part of The New Day, said on Twitter that “many” people in the WWE locker room are aware of Miley’s comments.

Many are aware. If true, he has to bear the albatross of being a bigot & working in a company that is now filled with minorities. — Florida Man (@WWEBigE) May 8, 2019

WWE released the following statement on behalf of Miley:

“There is no excuse for the inappropriate remarks that I made years ago. They do not reflect my personal beliefs nor who I am today, and I apologize to anyone I offended.”",https://www.si.com/wrestling/2019/05/10/wwe-lars-sullivan-controversy-racist-comments-apology,2019-05-10T09:40:00Z,SI.com,"225 Liberty St., New York, NY 10281"
Her Farm changes culture,"Her Farm is changing Nepal.

It is a women-owned farm, safe house in Mankhu, Nepal. It’s unique in Nepal, a patriarchal society in which women, generally, are subordinate to men in every aspect of life. Mankhu is approximately 20 miles from Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal.

Approximately 30 women live and work at Her Farm, which is located approximately 3,000 feet above sea level, Ann Price said. Price, daughter of the late Bruce Price, a longtime Bartlesville resident, discussed Her Farm at Monday’s meeting of the Bartlesville Noon Rotary Club. The Club has made multiple donations to Her Farm, including a $2,500 donation on Monday.

“A lot of people think about Nepal as in Mount Everest — ice, snow, it’s always cold. But at 3,000 feet, it’s not that cold, and where Mankhu is it’s about 3,000 feet up in the mountains — think about the Appalachian Mountains. Nepal is about the same distance from the equator as Florida. So, at 3,000 feet it’s tropical,” Price said.

Her Farm has evolved from a self-sufficient farm. Plans to fund and build a community/emergency center started in October 2016, Price said. The Mankhu Emergency and Community Center opened in August 2017.

“The plan at the time was eventually to add a radio tower. Maybe, we should have the ability to broadcast to the whole area. In case there is another emergency, we need to be able to communicate with other people,” she said.

Donations from Bruce Price, the Noon Rotary Club and others helped purchase the radio tower and associated broadcasting equipment, she added.

The center changed everything.

The women at Her Farm learned how to create FM radio broadcasts. Next, they added photography skills to their arsenal. It quickly evolved into shooting and editing videos, Price said.

“The women had to learn all this. What we realized, and what they realized, is they loved doing this. They were so technically savvy. They just picked it up, ate it up and loved it,” said Price.

Today, the Her Farm radio and video teams are highly visible in surrounding communities. They produce radio broadcasts, take photos of local events and have contracts to create video footage for documentaries, Price said.

“This is so far removed from what the expectations are for a girl in Nepal,” Price said. “A typical girl in Nepal is expected to have some education, but learning household chores and farming in preparation for marriage takes priority. … She should marry early — often to a man of her parent’s choosing to unburden her parents from the cost of her care. … Her husband will make all decisions for her.”

Price said the literacy rate for females in urban areas is about 39 percent.

In November of last year, the first broadcast from Mankhu 91.1 aired in Nepal. Why is this important? It means these women can do everything to change the culture in Nepal.

“When you change the narrator, you can change the narrative,” Price said.",https://www.examiner-enterprise.com/news/20190510/her-farm-changes-culture?rssfeed=true,2019-05-10T08:42:52Z,Bartlesville Examiner,"4125 Nowata Rd, Bartlesville, OK 74006, USA"
"Florida cold case murder of Laralee Spear, 15, perplexes detectives 25 years later","The lone person ever indicted remains on death row in 2 other killings, but is not considered a suspect in this case.

Deerfoot Road had been insulated from violence before April 26, 1994.

It was known to be a tranquil place. The rural, narrow dirt road leads to a lakeside park where wildlife roam.

Twenty-five years ago, an abduction and a series of gunshots radically changed the complexion of that tucked-away location near DeLand.

Violence appeared at Deerfoot and no one knows who brought it there.

Laralee Spear, 15-year-old DeLand High School freshman, was shot to death moments after getting off her school bus. Her body was found on a concrete slab behind a burned-out house about 200 yards from her home and about a half-mile from her stop at the corner of Deerfoot and South Spring Garden Avenue. Her murder remains unsolved.

“This child got off the bus at 3:15 (p.m.) and at 5:30 (p.m.) we find her,” said Volusia County Sheriff’s Detective Steve White, the agency’s lead cold case detective. “It’s just unbelievable to me that could happen in that location so fast (to) a child who’s not involved in any activities that would put her in danger.”

The full chronology of that afternoon has Spear getting off her bus at 3:15 p.m. Her mother, Barbara Spear, reported her daughter missing at 4:05 p.m.

Eight minutes later, deputies were dispatched to the Spear home. They showed up eight minutes after that and started searching.

At 4:59 p.m., deputies in Air One, the Sheriff’s Office’s helicopter, joined the search party.

At 5:35 p.m., one of those deputies in the air saw a body lying behind the abandoned house. Those on the ground confirmed the girl’s identity.

White was working as a detective in the New Smyrna Beach office at the time. During the next few days, he and other detectives from the east side were ordered to assist in the Laralee Spear investigation. Everything else was put on hold.

“I came into work the next morning and it was, ‘Grab your stuff. You’re (temporary duty) in DeLand until they release you,’ ” he said. “My office, the Ormond (Beach) office all got together and we went over to DeLand and got our assignments. We did neighborhood canvassing for a week.”

More than 1,000 leads were called in during that first month after the murder. The case still wound up cold.

Detectives were told by the girl’s mother that it was out of character for her to wander off by herself. If she took any additional time to walk home, it was only to spend a few extra minutes to get a closer look at her neighbor’s horses. The Sheriff’s Office concluded early in the investigation that someone attacked Laralee Spear during her walk — when she was out of sight from the Spring Garden intersection.

It was estimated by one of the detectives working on the case that she had walked 200 yards before encountering her killer. He also concluded Spear was dead within 25 minutes from when she got off the bus.

Ralph Henshaw, who retired from the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office about a decade before the murder, is now a volunteer investigator with the agency’s Cold Case Unit. He was recruited by former sheriff Ben Johnson for the purpose of delving into the Spear case.

He has absorbed every detail.

“The bus driver (saw) her get off,” Henshaw said, recalling what witnesses told detectives. “She didn’t seem to have any problem. There was no on around the area (who looked) strange.”

A small group of people were selling plants near Spear’s stop. They watched Spear get off the bus and head toward her house. They noticed nothing suspicious.

A neighbor in one of the half-dozen or so houses along Deerfoot often would sit outside in his wheelchair in the afternoon. On this particular day, he wasn’t feeling well and didn’t come outside, Henshaw said.

There is no telling what he would have seen or heard had he been outside. Either way, there was one fewer set of eyes on that street.

“She walked by like she did every day, every school day, and nobody (saw) her after that,” Henshaw said.

Laralee Spear was an elite student. She was a cheerleader and a member of the Keyettes, a school service organization. She sang in her church choir and played piano. She was known to be a wholesome girl. She had a reputation for being punctual. Her principal called her a model student.

“She was an exceptional young lady,” Henshaw said.

Someone far below exceptional became the focus of the investigation in November 1994.

Bobby Allen Raleigh, a high school dropout, was charged in the double murder of two men in DeLeon Springs. The victims were slain six weeks after the Spear murder. The two men were asleep in a trailer when Raleigh and his accomplice, Domingo Figueroa, shot them in their sleep. They kept shooting the second victim until their guns jammed. After realizing the victim was still alive, Raleigh took his gun and beat the man until he stopped breathing.

While in jail awaiting trail for the double murder, Raleigh allegedly told an inmate he had killed Spear. That’s what the State Attorney’s Office disclosed to the media. Raleigh was indicted for first-degree murder in the Spear case.

For the DeLeon Springs double murder, Raleigh was convicted and sentenced to death row, where he remains to this day. His accomplice is serving a life sentence.

Raleigh, who was 20 at the time of his arrest and is now 44, seemed resigned to his fate in the double murder. By comparison, he was adamant he had nothing to do with the Spear killing. A special prosecutor who was later assigned to the case agreed. He dropped all charges against Raleigh in 1998.

Today, no one associated with the case seems to have any lingering suspicions about Raleigh.

“I don’t look at him as a suspect at all,” Henshaw said. He and Sheriff’s Sgt. A.J. Pagliari interviewed Raleigh face-to-face a few years ago and didn’t come away thinking he had anything to do with Spear’s murder.

“There was not enough then to pursue him criminally and there is nothing that has changed since that time to make us think he is at the top of any persons of interest list,” Pagliari said.

White and Pagliari said 66 people have been investigated since the start of the case. Pagliari indicated that nobody has emerged as a suspect.

“Has anything come to light that says this person is more of a suspect than somebody else? No,” he said.

Thirteen years after the murder, in April 2007, the Sheriff’s Office held a media conference with Virginia “Ginny” Spear, Laralee’s younger sister. She helped deputies distribute fliers to DeLand-area homes and businesses. It was a media blitz to get the case back in the news and on the minds of residents in the hopes it would induce someone to come forward with information. Those efforts came up empty.

Any forthcoming break in the case, according to the Sheriff’s Office, would likely come from the forensic side. Any future advances in forensic technology could be beneficial to the investigation. Pagliari declined to be more specific.

The girl’s parents, David and Barbara Spear, were out of town and unavailable for an interview. They have seldom spoken publicly about the case. Henshaw said he remains in contact with them.

When Henshaw was recruited to join the Cold Case Unit as a volunteer, Johnson drove him to the crime scene. Those who investigate old, unsolved cases often develop an attachment to the victims of those cases. Henshaw feels that connection with Spear. It started to form during that ride with Johnson years ago.

“He took me in his own car down to the crime scene and showed me where it was at,” Henshaw said. “We were hoping, and still are, that we will solve this case.”

Anyone with information about the Laralee Spear murder case is urged to call the Cold Case Unit at 386-254-1535.

"Trump pledges help for Panhandle, Tyndall AFB","- President Donald Trump on Wednesday vowed Tyndall Air Force Base will be rebuilt after sustaining massive damage in Hurricane Michael, and he will approve the state’s request to boost federal funding for storm recovery in Northwest Florida.

Trump, during a campaign rally in Panama City Beach, said the federal reimbursement levels for hurricane recovery in the region will be boosted from 75 percent to 90 percent “in many circumstances.”

“We will never, ever leave your side,” Trump said following chants of “USA” and “four more years” from a crowd at the Aaron Bessant Park Amphitheater. “We’ve already given you billions of dollars, and there is a lot more coming.”

He said $448 million has been approved by his administration for housing disaster recovery assistance.

Trump’s comments came as he and Senate Republicans are locked in a battle with Democrats over how much of a stalled federal disaster-relief package should go to Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from Hurricane Maria in 2017. Delays in the relief package have frustrated Panhandle officials and residents.

Hurricane Michael devastated parts of the region after it made landfall Oct. 10 in Mexico Beach, east of Panama City. Gov. Ron DeSantis requested increased federal assistance after the storm was upgraded to a Category 5 hurricane on April 19.

Panama City Mayor Greg Brudnicki told WJHG Newschannel 7 it’s “encouraging” to get a promise of increased federal funding and the restoration of Tyndall.

“We know if they’re going to rebuild Tyndall, they have to rebuild Mexico Beach, they have to rebuild Panama City and all the rest of the municipalities around it because we support Tyndall,” Brudnicki said. “It’s 30 percent of our economy, and 90 percent of the people that work at Tyndall live in our cities. So we know if they’re going to rebuild Tyndall, we’re going to get the appropriations to rebuild all our cities and the county.”

Trump’s rally followed a tour of Tyndall. He was joined by DeSantis, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, both Florida Republicans.

“I really believe Northwest Florida is going to come back stronger than ever before,” DeSantis told the crowd.

The Air Force has already spent $450 million rebuilding Tyndall, where about 700 structures were damaged as it and nearby Mexico City Beach took a direct hit from Michael, which came ashore with winds of 160 mph. However, the recovery effort effectively halted on the base on May 1 as Congress has not provided needed supplemental funding.

Trump said he kept the base from closing and reiterated an Air Force recommendation to eventually locate three squadrons of F-35 fighters at Tyndall. The recommendation was made as F-22s formerly at Tyndall were moved after the storm to Alaska, Hawaii and Virginia.

The region has received about $1.1 billion in federal aid, but that amount remains far below what officials say is needed to complete infrastructure repairs, remove debris, reduce the risks of wildfires, rebuild schools and restore businesses areas and residential communities.

“Great conversation with @realDonaldTrump on the flight to #Florida about #DisasterRelief for #HurricaneMichaelincluding support for timber, @TeamTyndall & a 90-10 federal match. optimistic that good news is on the way,” Rubio tweeted after the base tour.

Attorney General Ashley Moody, Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez and state Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis were among those making opening remarks Wednesday night.

Patronis, who is from Panama City, called it a “blessing to have this much attention” from the president.

“This man could be anywhere, literally, he could be anywhere in the world today, but he’s here,” Patronis said. “And you’re being here is showing him that Northwest Florida will come back stronger than ever.”

Northwest Florida is a Republican stronghold, and Trump will need heavy support in the region as he runs for re-election next year. Before Trump arrived Wednesday, Democrats were already criticizing the president and Republicans for delays in storm response.

A Republican-sponsored proposal includes $610 million to fund a gap in Puerto Rico’s nutritional assistance program, an amount Florida Democrats called too low during a media conference call. U.S. Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., said the Democratic-led House, which approved a $14 billion relief package in February, would be willing to compromise if the Republican-run Senate could approve its own relief proposal.

Soto added Trump has inflated Puerto Rico relief numbers for political reasons.

“He continues to be overly sensitive about the failures of the administration, and his bruised ego is one of the reasons we find ourselves here today,” Soto said.

Soto noted that out of $41 billion allocated for Puerto Rico relief, $11 billion has been delivered.

Trump contended Wednesday night that money for the Panhandle recovery, as well as money for Midwest farmers recovering from flooding, Hurricane Florence victims in Georgia and the Carolinas and wildfire victims in California, is being delayed because Democrats want more for Puerto Rico.

Before departing for the Panhandle, Trump tweeted, “Getting ready to leave for one of my favorite places, the Florida Panhandle, where we’ve given, and are giving, billions of $$$ for the devastation caused by Hurricane Michael. Even though the Dems are totally in our way (they don’t want money to go there) we’re getting it done!”

Florida has already put up $1.64 billion for removing debris and providing other emergency assistance, money the state hopes to mostly recoup from the federal government.

Additionally, more than $220 million for recovery efforts was included in the state’s $91.1 billion budget that lawmakers approved Saturday.

U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., said during Wednesday’s Democratic conference call that the U.S. House will take up a supplemental funding bill on Friday that includes $700 million for Tyndall.

“Tyndall Air Force Base was flattened, absolutely flattened,” Wasserman Schultz said. “They should not have had to wait this long for the necessary and vital rebuilding support that they need.”",http://www.fox35orlando.com/home/trump-pledges-help-for-panhandle-tyndall-afb,2019-05-09T02:06:43Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA"

""Tommy Mitchell is the executive director of the Rattler Boosters. Every year, he tries to roll out a tour for me to solicit funds from our boosters,"" Simmons said.

""This gives us some face time with them, answer some questions and tell them the state of the program. I'm excited to be down there with them. It's during the recruiting season, so it kills two birds with one stone.""

Earlier in the week, Simmons visited high schools. He was joined on the recruiting trail by assistant coaches Billy Rolle (cornerbacks) and Jelani Berassa. Both men hail from Miami and have strong ties to the region.

Hernando county deputies seek dog dragging suspect,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Hernando County Sheriff's Office

SPRING HILL, Fla. (WFLA) - The Hernando County Sheriff's Office is asking for the public's help in locating a man accused of dragging a pit bull behind a truck in Spring Hill.

Deputies have identified the suspect as Gregory Tousignant, 58, witnesses told Hernando deputies the dog was tied to the truck’s back bumper by a piece of rope that was attached to the dog’s collar.

Tousignant was unaware the dog had jumped out of the bed of his truck.

Salem man dies in Central Oregon crash on Highway 20E,"CLOSE From insurance to when to call the police, here's what to know for next time you are in an accident. Wochit

A Salem man is dead following a crash on a remote stretch of highway between Bend and Burns in central Oregon.

Troopers responded to a report of a single vehicle crash on Highway 20E at about 10:15 p.m. Tuesday, according to Oregon State Police.

An investigation found that John Ottlinger, 66, of Salem, was driving a Dodge Caravan westbound near milepost 66 when he drifted off the highway into the adjacent ditch.

Ottlinger then overcorrected, crossed both lanes and crashed into the eastbound ditch, which caused the van to roll several times.

Officials say Ottlinger was not wearing a seat belt and was ejected from the vehicle. He died of injuries sustained in the crash.

The highway was closed for about 45 minutes for the investigation.

Circumstances of abuse involving werewolf mask not unique in Escambia County,"Videos allegedly depicted a 37-year-old man sending bursts of electricity into the 2-year-old body of a little girl, filming himself chasing her with his face hidden behind a werewolf mask as she screamed.

The extremity of the abuses that Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius is accused of committing against his live-in girlfriend’s daughter can make the details of the allegations appear unprecedented in their depravity.

But Gulf Coast Kid’s House Executive Director Stacey Kostevicki does not view the abuse allegations as being exceptionally unique.

“The bottom line is all abuse is the exertion of power and control,” Kostevicki said. “What better way to exert power and control, than to do it when a child is sleeping.”

New details: In wolf mask and Batman PJs, Pensacola man tortured child for cameras, report says

According to Kostevicki, one of the most common perpetrators of child abuse is the boyfriend of a single mother.

The Escambia County Sheriff’s Office announced last week that deputies had arrested and charged Celaius with abusing his live-in girlfriend’s 2-year-old daughter.

Sheriff David Morgan referred to Celaius' alleged abuses — which included shocking the child with an electric dog collar, shooting her with a BB gun, throwing milk bottles at her head as she nodded off to sleep and throwing a house cat on her face once she had fallen asleep — as “systematic torture.”

The specific factors, like wearing a werewolf mask, are, to say the least, uncommon. However, the case against Celaius fits a pattern of circumstances all too common in Escambia County.

Arrest: Pensacola man accused of 'systematic torture' and 'indescribable' abuse of 2-year-old

“When you move in with a person, the move provides 24-hour access to the child,” Kostevicki said.

Where the number of child abuse cases have fallen at the national level in recent years, they have risen in Escambia County, she noted.

Kostevicki speculated highly publicized abuse cases, like those involving R. Kelly and Larry Nassar, have turned into engrossing scandals that brought new awareness to child abuse. That awareness, she believes, has led to more abuse cases being reported across the country.

In Escambia County in 2018, one out of 11 children were involved in an allegation of abuse, Kostevicki said. These numbers have risen in recent years.

In 2014, one out of 14 children were involved in an allegation of abuse, according to the Department of Children and Families.

“With us, I do think poverty plays a role,” she said. “Families are more likely to move in with each other — single moms are more willing to move in with their boyfriends — if they can’t afford to live separately.”

Boyfriends of single mothers are definitely not the only perpetrators of child abuse in Escambia County. But Kostevicki said mothers moving in with significant others should be vigilant about protecting their child from any potential harm.

In 97% of child abuse cases seen by the Gulf Coast Kid's House, the abuser is a family member or a trusted family friend.

“We would advise parents, particularly moms who are considering moving in with a boyfriend, to be particularly vigilant about making sure they know that person is safe,” Kostevicki said. “If there are multiple kids in the household, be aware if the boyfriend is wanting to hang out with one of the children more than the rest or give only one of the children gifts.”

The Gulf Coast Kid’s House, along with its partners, provided services to over 3,015 children in the 2017-2018 fiscal year. Out of its 643 interviews with kids and 660 medical assessments of children, the Gulf Coast Kid’s House found indications of child abuse in 78% of its assessments.

"Man arrested, refused to remove obscene sticker from vehicle","Authorities say a Florida man was jailed after refusing to remove an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window.

A Columbia County Sheriff's Office report says 23-year-old Dillon Shane Webb was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence.

It says a deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite. The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court.

Officials say the deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part but Webb refused, citing his First Amendment free speech rights. The deputy then charged Webb with resisting and took him to jail.

Suspect caught in fatal shooting of Mississippi officer at police station,"JACKSON, Miss. – The manhunt for the suspected killer of a Mississippi police officer ended Monday night with the suspect's arrest.

Darian Tawan Atkinson, 19, who was wanted on capital murder charges, was led handcuffed through the same parking lot where he allegedly opened fire on Biloxi Police Officer Robert McKeithen on Sunday.

Atkinson, in a video streamed on social media by WLOX-TV, appeared to be smiling as he passed dozens of uniformed officers on his walk from a cruiser to the front doors of the police station. Some bystanders could be seen clapping and cheering.

Biloxi Police Chief John Miller said a Biloxi officer was on his way home when he spotted a man resembling Atkinson in Wiggins, about 35 miles northwest of Biloxi. He said the officer called the Wiggins Police Department, which sent officers to make the arrest.

""We feel vindicated. He’s been treated properly and fairly. And now we will grieve for the (officer's) family,"" Miller said. ""They’ll know shortly he’s been arrested. Maybe that will give them some relief.""

McKeithen, a nearly 24-year veteran of the Biloxi Police Department, was shot and killed outside a police station Sunday night.

It was unclear what prompted the killing. Miller said he didn't know of a motive.

Feb. 7: Matthew Rittner, Milwaukee police officer shot and killed, served two tours of duty in Iraq

Authorities said a man approached McKeithen in the station's parking lot after coming inside the station and shot the 58-year-old officer multiple times.

Miller said there will be another charge for accessory to a crime, and declined to elaborate further.

Miller wouldn't say whether Atkinson had told police anything. He said Atkinson would be questioned and then transported to the Harrison County jail in Gulfport. It's unclear when Atkinson will go before a judge or if he has a lawyer.

Miller said investigators want to make sure they have a ""solid case.""

""We want the district attorney to be pleased with the case we present. We want this guy to pay for what he’s done,"" he said.

Miller expressed thanks for the officers who worked the case, some of whom haven't rested in 40 hours, he said. He also thanked the community for their support.

Asked about the expression on the suspect's face as he was led through the police station doors, Miller replied: ""I'm not bothered by his smile.""

Monday began with law enforcement circulating video footage and photos of the then-unidentified suspected killer in hopes of pinning down his name. They showed a man in a black T-shirt, blue shorts and a red hat sauntering through a pair of sliding glass doors.

During a morning news conference, Miller described McKeithen as an ""unbelievably fine policeman.""

He had served on the force for nearly 24 years, he said, and was planning to retire this year.

""(McKeithen) was a fine and decent man, a great policeman and he served the citizens of Biloxi well,"" Miller said.

McKeithen leaves behind a wife, daughter, two stepsons and a stepdaughter, Miller said.

It's unclear how Atkinson got to Wiggins after a day when police searched locations in Biloxi, sometimes carrying assault rifles, looking for the man. Miller said he expected at least one person would be charged as an accessory for illegally aiding Atkinson.

When authorities announced they identified the suspect as Atkinson, they urged anyone who knew where he was to turn him in.

McKeithen's relatives said Monday through Biloxi city spokesman Vincent Creel that they weren't prepared to talk. A memorial service is planned Tuesday night at Biloxi police headquarters. The officer's funeral and burial are planned for May 13.

"Brevard duo accused of waterboarding man, force-feeding him dog food","Left to right: John Faulk, 27, and Steven Erickson, 24, charged with attempted first-degree murder and kidnapping.

TITUSVILLE, Fla. - Accusations of stolen cocaine escalated into kidnapping and torture over the weekend in Titusville, according to police reports.

Two men were arrested and charged with attempted murder and kidnapping. Police said the two beat and waterboarded a man after suspecting his friend had stolen cocaine from them Saturday, according to News 6 partner Florida Today.

Police were called about 12:30 a.m. Sunday when a battered man was admitted to the hospital, according to arrest reports. He had been pistol-whipped, waterboarded and force-fed dog food.

John Faulk, 27, of Titusville, and Steven Erickson, 24, of Cocoa, were charged with attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and inflicting harm on the person, robbery with a firearm and second-degree grand theft.

After a long day of drinking and using cocaine, the men believed their victim's friend had stolen cocaine from them before leaving to get food, police said. So they restrained the man's hands with tape and covered his nose and mouth with cloth before pouring water over his face, telling him to get his friend to return the cocaine or they would kill him.

They used table legs and a gun to beat him before uncovering his mouth to feed him dog food, police reported.

The torture lasted about 45 minutes before the man escaped to a nearby friend's house and then went to the hospital. Police said the suspects also stole the man's cell phone and over $800, Florida Today reported.

After police were called, officers responded to a Beverly Street home where gunshots from inside the residence prompted a SWAT response as well, Titusville police said.

“The SWAT team responded with tactical measures and two suspects were taken into custody,” according to a statement from Amy Matthews, spokeswoman for the Titusville Police Department.

Matthews did not say what tactical measures were used when arresting Faulk and Erickson at the home.

No further information was available about the incidents Monday afternoon. The case remains an ongoing investigation.

Faulk is being held at the Brevard County Jail Complex in lieu of $115,000 bond. Erickson is being held in lieu of $122,000 bond.

Florida man charged with DUI on his lawn mower,"HAINES CITY, Fla. - A Florida man arrested on DUI charges is nothing new, but when you add a lawn mower to the equation, it becomes a true #FloridaMan story.

Police arrested Gary Wayne Anderson, 68, Saturday after he crashed his lawn mower into a Haines City police vehicle.

An officer was inside a local business when he heard a loud crash from outside. After walking outside, the officer found Anderson sitting atop a lawn mower with a trailer.

Anderson admitted to hitting the vehicle while riding his lawn mower and was given a field sobriety test, which he failed.

While at the police department, Anderson claimed to have been poisoned by police and demanded to be taken to the hospital. At the hospital, Anderson's blood-alcohol content was registered at .241, more than three times the legal limit.

Cocaine was also found in Anderson's blood, but he said the police put the cocaine there.

According to police, Anderson's driver's license has been suspended since 1978 and he has two prior DUI convictions.

Trump’s new nickname for Pete Buttigieg: ‘Alfred E. Neuman’,"President Donald Trump gave Mayor Pete Buttigieg a new nickname during a 15-minute interview with POLITICO. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images White House Trump’s new nickname for Pete Buttigieg: ‘Alfred E. Neuman’ 'Alfred E. Neuman cannot become president of the United States,' the president told POLITICO in a 15-minute telephone interview on Friday afternoon.

President Donald Trump dismissed Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Friday in a single sentence.

“Alfred E. Neuman cannot become president of the United States,” the president told POLITICO in a 15-minute telephone interview, when asked what he thought of the South Bend, Ind., mayor. Neuman’s freckled, gap-toothed face and oversized ears have for decades graced the cover of the humor magazine Mad.

Story Continued Below

Buttigieg, the first openly gay major presidential candidate, has rocketed up the ranks of Democrats hoping to defeat Trump in 2020 and has basked in glowing press coverage and magazine cover stories in recent weeks.

POLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.

Trump, who made his remarks in an interview that stemmed from POLITICO’s inquiries for a separate story, has taken a few shots at Buttigieg as he’s risen in the polls, including at his recent rally in Florida.

""We have a young man, Buttigieg. Boot-edge-edge. They say ‘edge-edge,’” Trump said, enunciating the mayor’s name.

“He's got a great chance, doesn’t he?” Trump continued sarcastically, going on to suggest that Buttigieg might not be tough enough to square off against America’s adversaries. “He’ll be great representing us against President Xi of China. That’ll be great. I want to be in that room, I wanna watch that one.""

Buttigieg, a former Rhodes scholar and Navy Reserve intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan, has received some heat among skeptical Democrats wondering whether the 37-year-old mayor has enough experience to be president. Trump, 72, was elected without any governing experience, his supporters counter.

People who speak with Trump frequently say he believes his ability to define his political rivals with epithets can be decisive. During the 2016 presidential race, he labeled his Democratic opponent “Crooked Hillary,” at times simply referring to her as “Crooked.”

“Trump believes that if you can encapsulate someone in a phrase or a nickname, you can own them,” a person who knows Trump said in a recent interview. “Low energy Jeb, Little Marco, that kind of sh** really diminishes people and puts you in control of them and that’s what Trump is a genius for doing.”

“Everything in Trump’s world is about dominance and submission and so he’s trying to figure out how to own these candidates,” this person added.

In the interview, Trump compared the massive 2020 Democratic field to the 17 Republican rivals he faced in 2016, and said that many Democratic candidates “aren’t registering, as happened with [20]16. It seems as if many of them aren’t registering with the public.”

Trump also criticized Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whom he’s called “Crazy Bernie” in the past, and said he “seems to be going in the wrong direction.”

A spokeswoman for the Buttigieg declined to comment. Buttigieg said on Wednesday, “You can’t get too worried about the name-calling and the games he plays” and quoted a Chinese proverb, “When the wind changes, some people build walls and some people build windmills.”",https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/10/trump-pete-buttigieg-nickname-1317460,2019-05-10T23:58:06Z,POLITICO,"1100 Wilson Blvd Suite 601 Arlington, VA 22209 United States"
US increases tariffs as China vows countermeasures; trade talks end with no deal,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (ABC News) – Trade talks between the United States and China ended on Friday afternoon without a deal, but President Donald Trump tweeted that negotiators held ""candid and constructive conversations"" and said that the spike in tariffs on Chinese goods might be removed depending on future negotiations.

Over the course of the past week, the president went from saying trade talks with China were going well, to dramatically escalating a trade war by more than doubling tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The markets dipped as it appeared that the world's two largest economies would continue a tit-for-tat that has rattled investors and stressed American farmers and manufacturers. China's top trade negotiators flew in for two days of trade talks that ended without any progress.

Before the final round of discussions began on Friday and just hours after tariffs were imposed on China, Trump took to Twitter to declare that trade negotiations with China were progressing in a ""very congenial manner"" and falsely assert that the tariffs are going ""directly to the Treasury of the U.S."" But while the talks may have been congenial, they did not lead to any breakthroughs and no future meetings are scheduled now that the Chinese delegation is on their way back to Beijing.

Experts say the president's claim that revenue from the tariffs flows to the U.S. Treasury is not true, and numerous fact checks, including one this week from FactCheck.Org, and an ABC News fact check from December, have found the same. In reality, most experts say, tariffs essentially amount to a tax on US importers, which in turn pass the cost on to consumers.

According to the U.S. Trade Representative, there are nearly 6,000 items facing tariffs. The types of goods affected are wide-ranging and include fruit, vegetables, nuts, meat, cosmetics, pet food, building materials, chemicals, natural resources/compounds, electronics, machinery and many other items.

Digging in on his warring stance, the president expresses confidence in the efficacy of tariffs and reiterates that he is ready to take the conflict a step further, saying ""the process has begun to place additional Tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 Billion Dollars.""

The president's tweets come as Chinese negotiators are in Washington for the second day of direct talks. While the president and his advisers had been expressing optimism in recent weeks that the trade war could be nearing an end as the U.S. and China closed in on a trade deal, the administration moved to impose increased tariffs over the last week following what the administration said was an attempt by China to make changes to deal negotiations.

The White House said talks would continue Friday after negotiators again sat down face-to-face in Washington Thursday evening.

""This evening, Ambassador [Robert] Lightizer and [Treasury] Secretary [Steven] Mnuchin met with President Trump to discuss the ongoing trade negotiations with China,"" White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said late Thursday. ""The Ambassador and Secretary then had a working dinner with Vice Premier Liu He, and agreed to continue discussions tomorrow morning at USTR.""

Cina's Ministry of Commerce followed, two minutes after midnight Eastern time, with a statement, saying, ""China deeply regrets that it will have to take necessary countermeasures.""

Trump's top trade negotiators, Lighthizer and Mnuchin, met with their Chinese counterparts for a meeting and working dinner that kicked off at 5 p.m. on Thursday.

Initially, a 100-person team from China was expected to travel to the nation's capital on Wednesday, but the Chinese were shaken by Trump's tweets and the talks were delayed by a day.

Administration officials were cautious about characterizing the meetings as the high stakes negotiations are still underway, but they are expected to meet again on Friday morning to continue discussions.

The meeting comes on the heels of the president unexpectedly announcing plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods -- ranging from textiles to chemicals -- from 10% to 25%.

China's Commerce Ministry said Wednesday that Beijing will retaliate if the U.S. actually imposes the tariffs.

""The escalation of trade friction is not in the interests of the people of the two countries and the people of the world,"" the ministry said. ""The Chinese side deeply regrets that if the US tariff measures are implemented, China will have to take necessary countermeasures.""

At a rally in Panama City Beach, Florida, the president accused the Chinese of ""cheating our workers and stealing their jobs.""

He added, ""So they are flying in the vice premier tomorrow is flying in, good man. But they broke the deal, they can't do that.""

On Thursday, the president told reporters that the United States and China were once ""very close to a deal,"" and then the Chinese began to ""re-negotiate.""

Despite the renewed trade war, the president said he has been in touch with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Clermont man guilty of hit-and-run fatality,"TAVARES — David Sheets is guilty of leaving the scene of an accident that claimed the life of pedestrian Aaron Zacharias in 2015, a jury decided after one hour Thursday.

The state argued that it proved four elements necessary for a conviction: that the driver was involved in a crash leaving the scene of an accident; knew he was involved in a crash; knew or should have known that the accident caused injury or death; and that he willfully failed to stop at or near the scene.

Much of the week-long testimony was highly technical, including Highway Patrol investigators talking about the complex mathematical equations used in their crime scene calculations, and a state crime lab analyst who testified that the odds of another person’s blood other than Zacharias’ being on the pickup truck’s broken windshield was 700-billion-to-1, or 100 times greater than the world’s population.

What the jurors did not hear was that Zacharias was a “mama’s boy,” in the words of his mother, Neena Zacharias.

“He was single … humble, loving, kind, a man anyone would like to talk to,” she said. “There was no judgment. He was a greater listener.”

He was the kind of person who would support his friends, no matter what. Unemployed at the time of the accident, he once worked at the Circle K he had walked to that night.

For someone with a gentle spirit, he had an unusual dream: He wanted to be an MMA fighter.

He walked the route down Lakeshore, not even a mile, every night, to lose weight, Neena laughed. He would always buy a bag of spicy potato chips, then walk home to his mother’s house on Priebe Road to play video games.

Defense attorney Kelly Johnson blasted what she called “weak links in the chain,” including a 911 caller’s testimony that he saw a light in the road and stopped to check it out. It was a cell phone with a flashlight app, he said, and he picked it up and used it to survey the scene. However, a later crime scene photo showed the phone lying face down, and it is unclear how the phone ended up in the hands of investigators.

There was also no proof that a flashlight found in the “on” position belonged to Zacharias, she said.

She also suggested that witnesses, including a woman who lived near the crash site, had “perfect times” in their timeline testimony because they had reviewed crash reports.

Assistant State Attorney Jason Nimeth, however, pointed out inconsistencies in Sheets'original statement to Florida Highway Patrol and a recorded report he made to his insurance company a month later.

Sheets claimed he thought he hit a deer, like the time he hit one on a country road in Georgia in 2008 or 2009. He said he stopped, went down Lake Shore, turned around and came back and still did not see anything.

Nimeth showed jurors a map and said the time, distance and cross streets Sheet cited made no sense.

Sheets self-reported the accident on Dec. 8, 2015 but did so because one of the clues at the accident site were pieces of Bondo, an auto body repair paste. His 1968 Chevy truck had chunks of the substance on the front from a prior accident, and he knew it would be difficult to get repairs with that information published in news reports, Nimeth said.

Circuit Judge Heidi Davis ordered a pre-sentence investigation. The maximum sentence is 30 years, with a four-year-minimum mandatory, although technically the judge could waive that requirement.",https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20190509/clermont-man-guilty-of-hit-and-run-fatality?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T13:20:00Z,Daily Commercial,"212 E Main St, Leesburg, FL 34748, USA"
Gem of the Harlem Renaissance on view at Anderson Brickler Gallery,"Once again, the Anderson Brickler Gallery, in collaboration with the Riley House Museum, is at the forefront of introducing Tallahassee to history lessons that might have been missed along the way.

Combining art and literature and an historical backstory that touches both African-American life as well as the broader scope of the American-experience, the Anderson Brickler Gallery presents God’s Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse, as part of its Floridians in the Harlem Renaissance exhibition and the Riley’s Virtual Harlem show. Featured through May 13, Anderson Brickler will present an illustrated volume of “poetic sermons” by one of the stars of the Harlem Renaissance, James Weldon Johnson.

But first, a moment. What was the Harlem Renaissance?

Following the Civil War in 1865 and Reconstruction, African Americans began to take their place in politics and other civic and economic activities. By 1875, they held numerous public offices throughout the South. But a backlash soon began. The rise of the Ku Klux Klan and the passing of onerous “Jim Crow” laws starting in the 1890s disenfranchised and disempowered Southern African Americans.

Unable to live under ever more oppressive conditions, the Great Migration began. Heading North to the Midwest and Northeast, thousands of African Americans relocated to states where their enterprise and intellect could flourish. And thus was born in New York City a cultural movement known as the Harlem Renaissance.

Painters, writers, actors, dancers, and musicians began to produce works that would influence the rest of American culture for generations to come. And James Weldon Johnson and his illustrator, Aaron Douglas were at the forefront.

James Weldon Johnson was a Renaissance Man in any sense. Well-educated, he became a lawyer first, then a Broadway songwriter, then a diplomat serving the United States in Venezuela, a novelist, an important officer in the NAACP, and finally, a professor at Fisk University. One of his most influential works was a collection called, God’s Trombones, Seven Negro Sermons in Verse.

In the 1927 work, Johnson calls on his own memories of black preachers, their cadence, their passion, their ability to articulate emotionally the message of the sacred texts. Written not in dialect, which at the time was a subject of comical derision, but in simple language that goes directly to the heart, Johnson’s allusion to “trombones” is an homage to those preachers whose booming voices could modulate to lullabies, but whose verbal musicality could move a congregation to tears.

To illustrate the sermon/poems, The Creation, The Prodigal Son, Go Down Death, Noah Built the Ark, The Crucifixion, Let My People Go, and The Judgment Day, another Harlem Renaissance giant was chosen, Aaron Douglas.

Douglas was an illustrator and muralist whose large works hang in the New York City Library and at Fisk University where he founded the Art Department. Influenced by the Art Deco and Art Nouveau movements as well as African and Egyptian silhouettes, Douglas was in demand for the contemporary style in which he rendered African American figures.

The collaboration between Weldon Johnson and Douglas resulted in the modernistic prints for God’s Trombone’s that combine geometrical circles in soft shadows, stronger ""beams"" of light, forest and city locales, and African or African American figures who are variously joyous, industrious, as well as exploited. Rendered in softly muted tones that fade into shadow and mist, or layered again and again to form large groups, Douglas approaches the illustrations as he might a mural, monumentally conceived, yet exquisitely detailed.

It is these pieces of art that give God’s Trombones, Seven Negro Sermons in Verse much of its power, and which provide an intimate look at the creativity born of suffering that was the Harlem Renaissance.

The graphics, as well as the poems, are on display at the Anderson Brickler Gallery through May 13 at 1705 S. Adams St. Wednesdays 11 a.m.-3 p.m. and Saturday 2-5 p.m.. To schedule gallery visits and group tours: andersonbricklergallery@mail.com

"Lee Majors recalls his marriage to Farrah Fawcett, coping with paparazzi: ‘It was hard to get around’","Back in the day Lee Majors and Farrah Fawcett were Hollywood’s ultimate power couple.

He was the star of “Six Million Dollar Man” and she was the beloved blonde bombshell in “Charlie’s Angels.” But being married at the height of their fame was far from easy.

'SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN' STAR LEE MAJOR TELLS ALL

“It was hard to get around,” Majors recalled to People magazine on Wednesday. “It was not quite as hard as it is today with everyone [having] a cell phone and the social media is so quick. Back then we only had to deal with the paparazzi at large. A lot of time you could evade them, but not all the time.”

Major was originally introduced to Fawcett by his publicist which led to a fateful coffee date. The couple would tie the knot in 1973.

“It was very quick, and it lasted about almost 12 years,” said the 80-year-old. “But there was a year or so when I think I saw her two weeks in one year. It’s very difficult with careers like that. This business is tough. Working 14 hours a day, both of you, and the days went by.”

The couple separated in 1979 and ultimately divorced in 1982. Still, Majors insisted they remained “in communication toward the end.”

Fawcett passed away in 2009 at age 62. She shared a son with actor Ryan O’Neal.

FARRAH FAWCETT MAINTAINED CLOSE BONDS WITH FAMILY

Majors remarried in 1988 to Karen Velez and that union lasted until 1994. The actor tied the knot once more with his current wife, Faith Majors, in 2002.

“It is a record in Hollywood,” said Major about his lasting marriage.

And while Major got his big break starting out in Westerns alongside leading ladies like Barbara Stanwick and Linda Evans, he ultimately found fame in action roles.

“I look back now and think I wish I’d used my stuntman a little more,” he admitted. “My knees are a little wobbly and you feel your aches and pains. Doing the stunt work… made the day go faster and when you’re younger you feel invincible anyway. Now I don’t know why I did it!”

Still, Majors insisted he has zero regrets about his career.

“I find enjoyment in every role that I do,” he explained. “An actor’s job is to work and if you sit around waiting for great, great parts you’ll still be sitting around. I just like to keep working and keep moving.”

FARRAH FAWCETT'S PAL TELLS ALL

In fact, Majors is still keeping busy. He’s currently playing Jeff, an action role similar to Steve Austin from “Six Million Dollar Man” in the kids show “Thunderbirds Are Go.” According to the magazine, the UK-based series is a re-working of the classic puppet-made show of the ’80s and ‘90s.

“I’m the father who supposedly was lost in space years before,” said Majors. “They review it and they think there’s still a chance that he may be out there. They see signs of life and they do find me and they bring me back. It is a great homecoming episode and it’s quite fun — rejoining the Tracy family as the patriarch.”

“I felt I was re-doing ‘The Six Million Dollar Man,’” he continued “Up in the cockpit, ‘I’m losing it, I’m going to crash!’” he said. ""I remember them in the ’60s when they were popular. Now that they’ve rebooted, it seems to be quite popular again.”

Back in 2018, Majors revealed to Closer Weekly why his marriage to Fawcett came to an end.

“I ended up seeing her two weeks in one year,” he recalled about their marriage. “She was off doing films and stuff, and doing her series, and I was doing mine. That’s mainly the reason we got divorced; we never saw each other. We stayed great friends, but we just had our own careers going and didn’t have time for each other.”

Majors would later take a break from acting and quietly set residence in Florida. He ultimately returned to the screen and has kept himself busy ever since. However, he wouldn't trade his time spent on ""Six Million Dollar Man.”

“It was during those 10 years off that I realized how big this show was,” said Majors. “Because I was free to travel around the world to different places, and it was amazing how many people would come up to you — total strangers in totally different countries — just to say hello. It was very touching and just amazing to me.”",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lee-majors-farrah-fawcett-marriage,2019-05-09T09:00:55Z,Fox News,"1211 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10036"

Florida State sprinter Andre Ewers runs for history in title defense at ACC Championships,"CLOSE WATCH: Seminoles sprinter Andre Ewers discusses defending his title in the 100 and 200 at the ACC Outdoor Track & Field Championships. Rory Sharrock, Tallahassee Democrat

Florida State sprinter Andre Ewers is a household name within the track and field community.

His break-neck speed has propelled him to the top of the charts throughout his career.

Most recently, his top-rate honors include winning the 100, 200 and MVP at the 2018 ACC Outdoor Track & Field Championships.

All these attributes describe Ewers the athlete. However, it’s only part of the story.

The remaining portion which makes his half-glass full is his perseverance, strong work ethic and unshakable faith.

On Jan. 24, the Jamaican-born track star suffered a crippling hamstring injury. This ailment caused him to miss the ACC Indoor Track & Field Championships.

However, this pain was nothing compared to the emotions he felt on Feb. 9.

Two days before the ACC indoor meet in Blacksburg, Virginia, he received a phone call informing him his beloved grandfather, Noel ""Ta Ta"" Ewers, had died.

The bond between the two was more of a father-to-son relationship than a grandparent-grandchild connection. His grandfather raised him from a small child after his mother left Jamaica for the Virgin Islands.

The elder Ewers took his grandson everywhere he went throughout the parish of Saint Elizabeth. He instilled within him a can-do spirit and the intangibles of manhood.

""When I got the news, I didn't sleep for two days. Laying in my bed, I felt like I was on top of the ocean. I was cold and numb,"" Ewers said.

""He meant a lot to me. Watching him work hard and waking up at 6 a.m. showed me all about hard work. How a man should take care of his family. He cooked for me and took me to the doctor when I was sick. Everything a child wants, he did for me. I didn't have a father. I looked to him as that individual. He did everything completely from his heart.""

Time has since healed the sting from his physical and emotional wounds.

Now, Ewers is back to his elite form.

He's eager to successfully defend his titles this week at the ACC Outdoor Track & Field Championships at Lannigan Field in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Normally, the FSU senior races for school spirit and his son Aiden Ewers. However, this year, he's dedicating his races to his grandfather.

""I love my son and I'm always motivated by him to do great things. But I told myself I'm dedicating this season to my grandfather,"" Ewers said.

""I'm really excited and amped up because I didn't get to compete during the indoor meet. I had to renew my mind. A new mind gave me a new perspective on life. Me sitting out indoor was God transforming me into who I am. He was preparing me for what's to come. Now, it's up to me to go out and get that opportunity.""

Ewers' strong spiritual foundation helped him push through the adversity of his recovery period. While on the mend, he spent a lot of time in prayer and reading the Bible for positive reinforcement.

He frequently quotes Romans 8:28 which states: ""And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.""

With his mind, body and soul at full strength, Ewers lines up in the starter's block on a quest to make history.

In addition to helping FSU repeat as ACC men's champions, he's vying to become the first Seminole male sprinter to win the 100 and 200 two years in a row.

""Andre's chomping at the bit. It killed him to watch the team fight for the championship at indoor. He's healthy and he's gotten better every week,"" Florida State track and field head coach Bob Braman said.

""You've yet to see what you're going to see which is last year's Andre and then some. We've had some great sprinters like Walter Dix and Maurice Mitchell come through here. Nobody's won double-double twice. He' excited to etch his name on that one.""

As his time at FSU draws to a close, Ewers will prep for his pro career at the world championships. He also dreams of qualifying for the Summer Olympics in 2020.

His work ethic along with a strong-willed commitment is a driving force for his present and future endeavors.

""I remember when I came on my visit, on the cover of a book they gave me, it said 'leave your mark.' That is my whole mindset going into an ACC championship is to leave my mark,"" Ewers said.

Appeals court rules it has no 'jurisdiction' over confession in Segura murder case,"CLOSE Henry Segura takes the stand in his own defense during the quadruple murder trial on Aug. 11, 2017.

An appeals court ruled it doesn’t have the authority to require a gang members' claim he is responsible for a 2010 quadruple murder to be allowed at the trial of the man accused of the crime.

In an opinion released Tuesday, the First District Court of Appeal wrote it did not have the jurisdiction over what evidence could and couldn’t be used in Henry Segura's upcoming trial.

The DCA dismissed the petition by Segura's attorneys to force the Second Judicial Circuit to allow the odd testimony of James Carlos Santos that he, from federal prison, ordered the murders Segura is charged with committing.

Segura, 40, has sat through 12 trial delays and one mistrial on charges he was responsible for the brutal November 2010 killing of his girlfriend Brandi Peters, her twin daughters, Tamiyah and Taniyah Peters, and their 3-year-old son JaVonte Segura.

He has remained in the Leon County Detention Facility for 2,765 days since his arrest in 2011. He was set to stand trial last month but the case was continued.

On the eve of Segura’s first trial in August, Santos claimed Peters was killed in a drug cartel hit that he orchestrated.

A series of threatening emails exchanged between Peters and Santos in the days before she was killed show she was concerned about her involvement with Santos, the Chicago-based gang, the Vice Lords, and the Los Zetas cartel, according to Segura’s attorney Nathan Prince and Santos’ testimony. Peters is purported to have been running Colombian cocaine for the Mexican cartel and skimmed close to $90,000 of her loads.

With Santos’ testimony, Segura could be acquitted. Without it, he likely faces another mistrial, one of his attorneys Michael Ufferman contended.

The DCA judges agreed the particulars of the case warranted a closer look, but could not rule on the potential impact of the evidence.

“Segura’s circumstances are indeed unusual,” the judges found. “But none grants us jurisdiction for the pre-trial review of disputed evidentiary issues. Neither pretrial detention nor the possibility of another mistrial constitutes the type of irreparable harm necessary (to support allowing the evidence.)”

Prosecutors allege Segura killed Peters and the children to avoid paying more than $20,000 in back child support.

Santos invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at Segura’s first trial and did not take the stand. His testimony that he is responsible for the murders has been refuted by Prosecutor Jon Fuchs and has been previously ruled inadmissible in trial.

Santos falsely claimed the murder of a man in Kentucky and an Atlanta police officer.

In letters sent to Leon Circuit Judge James C. Hankinson that have been filed in court records, Santos has expressed interest in testifying at Segura’s next trial.

Dericka Lindsey case: 9-year-old's adopted mom to stand trial for her death,"CLOSE A memorial was held for 9-year-old Dericka Lindsay Thursday, Nov. 16, 2017. She died after her cousin sat on her as punishment Oct. 14.

A Pensacola woman will stand trial Thursday and Friday for her alleged role in a bizarre form of discipline that killed her adopted daughter.

Grace Joan Smith, 71, is the last of three people to face a jury in the death of 9-year-old Dericka Lindsey. Both Smith's husband, James Smith, and niece, Veronica Green Posey, have already been convicted and sentenced to prison for their roles in the child's death.

In October 2017, the Smiths reportedly called Posey to help them stop Dericka from misbehaving. Prosecutors say Grace Smith and Posey both spanked the girl, then Posey — who weighed approximately 320 pounds — sat on Dericka's torso for several minutes, suffocating her.

James Smith ultimately pleaded no contest to charges of aggravated manslaughter and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. Posey was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Court records indicate both co-defendants could be called as witnesses in the Grace Smith's trial.

Grace Smith's trial was briefly delayed in February when a judge ruled she was not competent for trial. February. At the time, physicians testified that she suffered from dementia and refused to eat food or take medication.

Smith was involuntarily committed to a state hospital where staff worked to restore her ""competency"" and get her to a state where she could follow court proceedings and help her attorneys craft her defense.

Medical staff made quick progress, and in April the court determined that Smith was fit for trial.

BLOTTER: What's a knife or five between friends?,"PANAMA CITY BEACH — An intoxicated man demonstrated over the weekend exactly why deputies pat people down for their safety before taking them to jail.

A Bay County Sheriff's deputy responded to a Sunset Avenue address, where they found a man hopping fences through people's backyards. The ""obviously intoxicated"" man was identified and told deputies he was just looking for his own place and apparently decided the way to do that was to fence hop in people's backyards until he found his home or the cops were called, whichever came first.

When backup arrived, a deputy asked the man to remove the knife that was visible on his hip while they sorted everything out. The deputy then asked the man if he had any other weapons before patting him down.

During the pat down, the deputy found not one, not two, not even three, but four additional knives on the man.

And a loaded gun.

The man did not have a concealed carry permit for the .22 revolver, and the man was detained in a patrol vehicle.

About that time, the mystery of the fence-hopper deepened as deputies located a silver Harley-Davidson motorcycle laying in the roadway nearby next to a damaged mailbox. The fence-hopping man was wearing a biker club ""cut"" so, putting two-and-two together, the deputies asked if the bike belonged to the man, which he denied.

""(The man) denied that the bike was his, despite the fact that he had the key for it on his waist and his foot prints were all over the ground next to the bike,"" the deputy wrote.

Despite his ""deny deny deny"" tact, the man was arrested by Florida Highway Patrol for DUI.

CHARLOTTE COUNTY, FL (WINK) - A Florida woman had something up her sleeve for a Charlotte County Sheriff's Deputy. Or should we say, down her pants.

Driver Michael Clemons, 22, and his 25-year-old passenger Ariel Machan-Le Quire were pulled over after running a stop sign early Monday morning.

Clemons told the deputy they were collecting frogs and snakes, but the deputy found more than what he bargained for.

Officials say 41 turtles were found in the woman's bag, and when asked if she had anything else she pulled a gator from her pants.

The man and woman were both cited for a bag limit violation and possession of the reptiles, which the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said have since been released.",http://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/news/main-news/florida-woman-pulls-gator-from-pants-during-traffic-stop-found-with-41-turtles-in-bag/1986858900,2019-05-07T20:58:17Z,BIGCOUNTRYHOMEPAGE,"4510 S 14th St, Abilene, TX 79605, USA"

Man calls Miami Beach bagel shop to unleash attack against Jews,"<p>Detectives are investigating after a Miami Beach cafe received a disturbing phone call on Monday. </p>

<p>Detectives gathered evidence, including phone records and recordings, from Bagel Time Cafe on Alton Road after the owner, Yehoshua Nodel, said his wife got the call from a man who began asking strange questions.</p>

<p>""(He) wanted to know if we're Jewish. Wanted to know if our workplace is Jewish. She said, 'Yes."" So he said, 'Oh, I know all of you Jews in the world, what you do. I'm going to expose you all,'"" Nodel said. </p>

<p>Nodel's wife hung up the phone, but the man called back. His attacks and the ranting weren't over.</p>

<p>Nodel said the man basically told his wife that Jews were taking over the world.</p>

<p>""(He said,) 'We're going to make sure you can't overpopulate like you are now and we're going to get rid of you,' basically,"" Nodel said. ""'I'm here. That's my mission.'""</p>

<p>Police were eventually called and are taking the threats seriously.</p>

<p>Nodel said he wasn't taking any chances in light of recent threats across South Florida and attacks on Jews in the U.S., like the shooting at Chabad of Poway in California and the synagogue attack in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>""This thing could happen in any of our businesses all around Miami,"" Nodel said. ""Personally, I wouldn't get a gun permit until today, but now I'm rethinking it, you know? Maybe it's something I should have.""  </p>

<p>Nodel said he has seen increased security at his temple and more people carrying guns. </p>

"Florida man had over 25K sexually explicit images and videos of children, deputies say","- A Florida man was arrested and charged with 57 counts of possessing child pornography on Monday.

The Volusia County Sheriff's Office reported that 48-year-old Wade Leon McKeehan was arrested on a warrant after he turned himself in at the DeLand Police Department at 2 a.m. He is charged with possessing photos and video images portraying sexual performance by a child.

They said that detectives found 25,529 electronic images and videos in McKeehan's possession. The images portrayed children of both genders between ages 1 and 13 in sexually explicit situations.

The Volusia County Sheriff’s Office’s Child Exploitation Unit reportedly began investigating McKeehan in December 2018. A search warrant on his home was finally executed on March 20th. Electronic devices were seized for forensic examination and detectives interviewed him.

An arrest warrant for McKeehan was issued Friday, the Sheriff's Office said. He was taken into custody and transported to the Volusia County Branch Jail. He remains there on no bail allowed until his first appearance before a judge.

More charges are possible, the Sheriff's Office said. Detectives are still searching for any additional potential victims of sexual exploitation. Anyone who may have been a victim of this suspect or any similar case is urged to call the Child Exploitation Unit at (386) 323-3574.

Man wanted on child porn charges in California arrested in Keys,"Michael Manning, wanted by California authorities since 2016, was arrested Friday in the Florida Keys.

KEY WEST, Fla. - A 58-year-old man wanted by California authorities on child pornography charges has been arrested in the Florida Keys.

Michael Manning was arrested Friday on Stock Island. He has been wanted by police in Chico, California, since 2016 on charges of sexually soliciting a minor under the age of 14, engaging in sex acts with a minor and possession of child pornography.

Monroe County Sheriff's Office spokesman Adam Linhardt said deputies were called to an alarm on Shrimp Road and found a man in an unlocked trailer on the side of the property.

The man called himself ""William Wallace Littlejohn"" and said he didn't have any identification.

Federal authorities assisted in the investigation, and deputies were able to identify the man as Manning.

California authorities claim Manning didn't show up to a court hearing, and his vehicle was found parked on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

In addition to the California charges, Manning also faces charges of providing a false name to law enforcement. He was being held without bond at the Stock Island jail and will be returned to California to face charges there.

A group raised over $20 million to ‘build the wall.’ Now its supporters want answers.,"A December fundraising campaign brought in more than $20 million over the course of a few weeks, its thousands of donors united by a common goal: the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, oft-promised by President Trump.

Some four months later, a contingent of those supporters is ready to see what their money has built.

The now-famous border wall GoFundMe was conceived by Purple Heart recipient Brian Kolfage, who wrote at the time he was upset by “too many illegals . . . taking advantage of the United States taxpayers,” and the “political games from both parties” when it came to border security. Kolfage, a triple amputee, pressed onward despite falling short of his $1 billion goal — launching a nonprofit to build portions of the wall on private land for a “fraction of what it costs the government.”

While the majority of donors continue to believe in Kolfage’s efforts, the nonprofit’s clandestine operations and assurances of progress are insufficient for others. Some have taken to social media, seeking photos, videos — anything — for evidence they aren’t being misled.

“I am very disappointed in you Brian Kolfage, where are the progress photographs?” one woman posted to the We Build The Wall Facebook page.

“Quit talking about it and do it,” another commented.

“I’ve been away for FIVE months,” one person tweeted in April. “When’s the groundbreaking?”

Reporting on the apparent lack of progress on the private wall, published early Friday by the Daily Beast, drew criticism from Kolfage. The veteran called out the story’s author, Will Sommer, who indicated he’s repeatedly asked Kolfage for proof they were close to a groundbreaking.

“Omg this is PERFECT timing by the liberal rag news site. They are about to look more stupid than @hillaryclinton on election night 2016!” Kolfage wrote. “I guaranteed we would build the wall . . . and I’ll leave it at that!""

Kolfage did not respond to an email and message from The Washington Post requesting comment Friday. While the nonprofit has floated various groundbreaking dates in the past, it’s not exactly clear when, or if, construction will begin.

“We should be turning dirt on this thing by May 1, June 1 at the latest, according to our experts,” Kolfage told Politico in February. In a March 21 interview with American Family Radio, however, the veteran asserted they were going to “start breaking ground” in April.

[Pentagon will shift an additional $1.5 billion to help fund Trump’s border wall Add to list]

In the interview, Kolfage said his nonprofit had identified eight locations to build along the border, but failed to name them, stating that his efforts could be thwarted by liberals if they were revealed.

“I wish I could name where it’s at, but we can’t name it because of the ACLU, these other liberal groups who want to sue us and impede our progress,” he said. “But it’s actually happening, the process is happening . . . the project is moving forward.”

He continued, “But as soon as we start breaking ground, we’ll be putting that information out there to show the American people what they’re doing.”

Kolfage has previously indicated that We Build The Wall Inc. seeks to develop segments of the wall on private property, which he told The Washington Post in January would cost $2 million to $3 million per mile. His GoFundMe says he’s visited the border to scope out potential sites and negotiate with private land owners. Kolfage has also enlisted the help of several high-profile politicians, among them former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Kris Kobach, the former Secretary of State for Kansas, who sit on the group’s advisory board.

Back in January, Kobach told the New York Times they’d hopefully be breaking ground “within weeks.”

Some critics noted Kolfage was accused of shady behavior in the past, including allegations of misusing funds he raised. NBC and BuzzFeed investigations earlier this year alleged that Kolfage peddled false articles and conspiracy theories with the intent of harvesting reader email addresses. The purported scheme would draw people back to his websites and Facebook pages, generating hundreds of thousands in advertising revenue, Buzzfeed reported.

Facebook removed several of the pages he operated last year, according to NBC, in a purge of pages that were used to “drive traffic to their websites.” In response, Kolfage created a new campaign, “Fight4FreeSpeech,” which also accepts donations.

BuzzFeed looked into Kolfage’s previous crowdfunding efforts, which included an initiative to mentor wounded veterans at military hospitals — among them Walter Reed and Brooke Army Medical Center. He raised thousands for the project, according to BuzzFeed, but spokespersons for the medical facilities told the outlet they have no record of him working at the hospitals or donating money.

Asked about the story in January, Kolfage told The Post that BuzzFeed “100 percent lied” and had fabricated the investigation to slander him. He said the money was raised to cover his travel expenses, and that he only used them for that purpose.

On Friday, many supporters of Kolfage called the Daily Beast story fake news intended to stymie donations. We Build The Wall occasionally replied in agreement, reassuring commenters the wall was on its way.

“This is what we call FAKE NEWS,” they wrote in a post. “We didn’t stop anything and we are full steam ahead. The wall is being built.""

As of Friday night, the group said they’ll be breaking ground “shortly.”

In a separate comment, one woman indicated she’d heard enough.

“Saying it doesn’t get it done,” she wrote late Friday. “Do it.”

St. Catherine honors Thummel-Schwindt with nursing award,"Stephanie Thummel-Schwindt has always been a great nurse, said her supervisor, Rochelle Clower. She gives good care, her patients want for nothing.

But the thing that makes Thummel-Schwindt the nurse of the year — or the century, maybe — is her leadership.

“She really takes new nurses under her wing, helps them out,” Clower said. “She’s always calm, cool, collected, no matter what’s going on in the unit, and she always is a cheerleader. And if it gets to the point where she thinks ‘OK, this is a little too much,” then she has no problem picking up the phone and saying ‘We need help,’ or advocating for her staff and patients, as well. That’s what makes her great.”

Clower, director of acute care nursing and hospice, is clearly not alone in her thinking. This week, Thummel-Schwindt was voted winner of the hospital’s 2019 Clinical Excellence in Nursing Award, earning the honor out of 44 nominees from St. Catherine Hospital, Siena Medical Clinic, the Women’s Clinic, Plaza Medical Center and the Convenient Care Clinic.

Thummel-Schwindt was given a plaque, a monetary gift and, like dozens of honorees before her, a nursing cape embroidered with her name. She, Elda Menjivar from the intensive care unit and Emma Merrill from hospice were all finalists for the award, voted in by their peers.

When Thummel-Schwindt hit a wall of uncertainty in college, staring down difficult classes that blocked her original plan to be a doctor, her mom encouraged her to keep going.

“You know you’re supposed to be a nurse,” she told her daughter.

Thummel-Schwindt, a native Garden Citian, had volunteered at Garden Valley Retirement Village when she was a kid and connected with the residents instantly. It was “like having a whole building full of grandmas and grandpas,” she said, and she just wanted to make them happy. Helping and caring for others came naturally.

The to-be nurse took her mom’s advice. Today, she said it was the best decision she ever made.

Thummel-Schwindt has been a nurse for nine years, three of them at St. Catherine Hospital as a medical/surgical floor nurse and charge nurse. But, before that, she bounced around the country for years as a traveling nurse, stopping in towns for several months at a time to fill hospitals’ staffing shortages.

She went to a large, bustling hospital in Wyoming, and another in Zephyrhills, Fla., a town that essentially shut down in the summer months when the vacation home crowd migrated north. Once she came to Atwood to be closer to her family and to-be husband.

Each place came with its own operations and policies, supplies and office culture.

Sometimes “our worlds gets pretty small,” she said, and it was healthy to get a taste of different perspectives and stay flexible.

Thummel-Schwindt’s favorite part of the job, wherever she is, is the patients. She likes to care for them and connect with them. You never forget the sadder or scarier times, she said — the first crisis or death — but the warmer moments stand out on their own.

She remembers cancer patients’ persevering, positive outlook on life at an oncology center in Hays. Another man in Florida panicked as a condition momentarily made it difficult for him to breathe, and she sat with him, calming him as the moment and anxiety passed. They sat on the bed breathing together, she said.

At St. Catherine, Thummel-Schwindt’s care for her patients is apparent. In a hectic, breakneck environment, she always takes time to really listen to those under her care and their loved ones. It’s a compassion and efficiency balancing act that takes skill and practice, and it makes her a better nurse, Clower said.

“She truly cares about each person, you can tell just by how she interacts with them,” Clower said.

You have to look at patients like they’re family members, Thummel-Schwindt said. Their past, their baggage, their mistakes don’t matter.

“The only thing that matters is what they’re here for and helping them through that … ” Thummel-Schwindt said. “You have to be willing to get in there and do what you need to do.”

About three months ago, Thummel-Schwindt was promoted to house administrative coordinator. When the directors and executive team are gone, she’s in charge, Clower said. She oversees the entire hospital at night.

Thummel-Schwindt is calm in any critical situation, and she always makes good, thoughtful, wise decisions, Clower said.

“She’s just got it,” Clower said.

As a leader, Thummel-Schwindt said she hopes she imparts the importance of putting patients first and that anyone, especially new nurses, always feel like they can approach her and ask her questions.

The lessons from her current and past co-workers still stick with her, from practical skills to mantras like she learned at the oncology center in Hays: life is short, and you need to enjoy what you can and help people through what you can.

“I learn something every day from my co-workers. You have to,” Thummel-Schwindt said. “I am the nurse I am because of the people I’ve worked with.”

"The Wave, Undie Run undone, ‘Florida Man’ the series: News from around our 50 states","Alabama

Montgomery: Lawmakers postponed a vote on a proposed abortion ban Thursday after anger erupted in the state Senate when some Republicans stripped an exception for rape and incest from the bill. Shouting broke out among senators when the exemption was removed without a roll call vote. Democrats and some Republicans objected to the change to the bill, which would make performing an abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony, being gaveled through quickly. Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh suggested lawmakers go home for the weekend to cool off and resume debate Tuesday. Marsh said he supports an exemption for rape and wants a roll call vote on the matter next week. The anger underscored tensions over the proposal that would become the most stringent abortion restriction in the country if approved.

Anchorage: Eight conservation groups sued Tuesday to stop the largest sale of Alaska old growth timber in decades, claiming the U.S. Forest Service violated environmental policy and its own management plan for the Tongass National Forest with the sale. The agency’s plan is to harvest as much as 225 million board feet of old growth timber from Prince of Wales Island. The Forest Service didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason, who has dealt two setbacks to the Trump administration this year. She found that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority when reversing bans on offshore drilling and that the administration violated federal law with a proposed road that would split a wilderness area in a national wildlife refuge.

The agency is asking for public comment, and changes could be implemented as soon as October, agency official Mike Herder says. Visitors compete for permits in a monthly online lottery and at daily walk-in drawings. Less than 5% of the 150,000 people who wanted to hike the trail last year were actually able to do it, according to federal data.

Arkansas

Batesville: A juvenile detention facility synonymous with neglect and abuse is to be shuttered and the building transformed into a treatment center for sex trafficking survivors, officials say. White River Regional Juvenile Detention Center will close by this summer, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Jonathan Pickering, facility director, says the new center will provide youths who were forced into the sex trade with at least three individual and three group therapy sessions a week. Pickering says families can join the sessions too, and staff will arrange transportation if necessary. The facility has a storied history. In April, a former White River jailer was sentenced to seven years in prison for what a judge called “sadistic and completely unjustified” punishments for disorderly juveniles. Another was imprisoned in March for violating youths’ rights and falsifying documents.

San Diego: The San Diego Zoo has two new arrivals: a pair of endangered African penguin chicks. The zoo announced Wednesday that the fluffy chicks – named Doug and Barbara in honor of Douglas G. Myers, president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Global, and his wife, Barbara Myers – hatched two months ago. The eggs came from two breeding couples. The zoo says it’s the first time eggs laid by its adult penguins have hatched there. Staffers have been working with the chicks to get them used to humans before they are introduced into the penguin colony in the next few weeks. African penguins are an endangered species. Their numbers have dropped by more than 60% in the past three decades, and only 23,000 breeding pairs are known to exist. The decline is blamed on several factors, including disease, habitat destruction, and lack of food from overfishing, climate change and pollution.

Colorado

Fort Collins: The end-of-semester Undie Run at Colorado State University started innocently enough, with a few hundred participants in their skivvies and a handful of clothes-filled trash bags carted off to Goodwill, according to its first student organizer. But more than a decade later, CSU is putting its foot down, taking its hardest stance yet against an event it now says is characterized by public intoxication and rampant sexual misconduct. Its message – in a letter distributed to students, emailed to parents and printed in multiple full-page ads in the campus newspaper – is clear: “The university will not allow the ‘undie run’ to take place this year.” The run, which has never been sanctioned or supported by CSU, has sprung up every spring since 2008 thanks to Facebook groups led by largely unnamed organizers and campus word-of-mouth. It’s typically held on the last day of classes before finals week, which for this semester is Friday.

Connecticut

Hartford: The state’s Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has voted to incrementally increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023, following a marathon, overnight debate. Weary lawmakers advanced the bill to the Senate, 85-59, with one Democrat joining Republicans in opposition, shortly after noon Thursday. The occasionally contentious debate, which began about 10 p.m. Wednesday, was wrapped by New Haven Rep. Robyn Porter, the Democratic House chairwoman of the General Assembly’s Labor Committee. Referencing her own early struggles as a divorced mother of two, Porter said the wage increase will help those who “don’t have two nickels to rub together” and feel like $10 is $100. But Republicans warned the wage increase will harm an already fragile state economy and lead to job reductions and more automation.

Milford: Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, one of the state’s best-known businesses, announced Thursday that it is merging with Boston Beer Co., the makers of Sam Adams beer and Angry Orchard hard cider. The merger, valued at about $300 million, is expected to close late in the second quarter of 2019, subject to closing conditions. It’s a stunning turn of events for the Milford-based, independent brewery founded by Sam Calagione, a Massachusetts native, and his wife Mariah, who was born in Delaware. Dogfish Head plans to retain its name and will still be a craft brewery, according to a press release sent out Thursday. The brewery began in Rehoboth Beach in 1995 as a “nanobrewery.” As the company grew, brewing moved to its current Milton site. The brewery and the tasting room have since become one of Delaware’s top tourist destinations.

District of Columbia

Washington: The chair of the City Council has proposed an amendment to the city’s 2020 budget that would severely limit access to public records. The Washington Post reports the legislation would allow the city to reject record requests that don’t include specifications about the sought documents, including the subject matter, names of senders and recipients, and a date range. It would only permit the disclosure of information “regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.” Chairman Phil Mendelson says the Freedom of Information Act “wasn’t intended for fishing expeditions.” His proposal comes after the newspaper requested email records through FOIA and found that Councilman Jack Evans used his government email to pitch himself to area lobbyists.

Florida

Stuart: The wacky, weird and wild world of Florida Man is getting its own show. Oxygen Media, which in 2017 announced a full-time shift to true-crime-related television, revealed Tuesday that a series based on “America’s most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State” has been added to its projects. There is no premiere date for the show. The series will be developed by Blumhouse Productions and Man vs. Robot. Blumhouse, founded by Jason Blum, an Academy Award nominee and Emmy winner, is known for producing low-budget horror films “Get Out,” “The Purge” and “Insidious.” With the working title of “Florida Man,” the series will “unravel the strange twists and turns and try in vain to reason how and why this breed of killers took their crimes to levels beyond comprehension,” Oxygen officials said.

Georgia

Atlanta: The state’s law enforcement will have to preserve rape kits for much longer than what was previously required under a bill signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp this week. Democratic Rep. Scott Holcomb, the bill’s main supporter, says the DNA evidence in the rape kits will help solve cold cases and pursue justice for survivors of sexual violence. Previously, Georgia only required rape kits to be stored for 10 years. The new law requires the state to preserve the evidence 30 years after the arrest date or seven years from the completion of a prison sentence, whichever occurs later. If there are no arrests, the kit must be stored for 50 years. Holcomb also authored a 2016 law that helped cut down on the state’s backlog of rape kits.

Hawaii

Honolulu: Federal officials are asking the public to give adequate space to a monk seal that has been resting on a Waikiki beach. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Wednesday that the female seal identified as 8-year-old Kaiwi has come onto the beach in Honolulu four times in recent days. Hawaiian monk seals are an endangered species protected by state and federal laws that typically forages at night and “hauls up” to rest on beaches during the day. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials ask members of the public in the high-traffic area to remain behind barriers set up to protect the seal. Officials say Kaiwi has previously given birth to pups in south and east Oahu. Although she does not appear pregnant at this time, it is possible.

Idaho

Boise: State agencies are racing to beat a Friday deadline to keep alive thousands of administrative rules after the Legislature’s House of Representatives in April killed a bill reauthorizing them. Republican Gov. Brad Little directed state agencies to submit temporary and pending rules by Friday to be vetted before publication in a special Idaho Administrative Bulletin on June 19. A 21-day public comment period follows before the rules can attain temporary status by July 1 and remain in effect. Many state agencies have started the process, and on Wednesday the Idaho Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in a special meeting voted 4-0 to authorize the Idaho Department of Lands to initiate temporary rulemaking on the agency’s oil and gas regulations.

Illinois

Rockford: Plans are in the works to open a visitors’ center for the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Laurent House, which opened as a museum four years ago. The Rockford Register Star reports the Laurent House Foundation plans to renovate dilapidated properties across the street from the home. It will offer a visitors’ center and gift shop and have offices and parking. Private donations are funding the $500,000 project. An estimated 2,000 people toured the home last year, and it has attracted visitors from Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom. The 2,600-square-foot Laurent House, built in the early 1950s, is on the National Register of Historic Places. It’s the only house Wright designed specifically for someone with disabilities. The foundation won approval Monday from the Rockford City Council to annex the properties.

Indiana

Indianapolis: Sports betting will become legal and construction of two new casinos will be allowed in the state under a bill signed by the governor Wednesday. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb endorsed the bill on his final day to act on the measure approved by lawmakers after they reached a deal in the final hours of this year’s legislative session. So far this year, Indiana joins Montana and Tennessee in moving to legalize sports wagering after six other states moved quickly following a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing it nationwide last year. Indiana sports wagering could start in September. Bets could be placed by anyone 21 or older at a casino or by mobile devices after a bettor has registered with an Indiana casino. Holcomb says the state’s casino industry has faced greater competition as neighboring states have legalized more forms of gambling.

Iowa

Iowa City: In an effort to help the environment without skimping on photographic fun, the University of Iowa Pentacrest Museums, made up of the Old Capitol Museum and the Museum of Natural History, have made an enticing offer for graduates. Confetti has always been a part of graduations, but the museum group wants it to become a thing of the past, posting on its Facebook page that it’s ready to digitally alter graduation photos to add confetti. The post asked students to consider that “many kinds of confetti are not biodegradable and are a health risk to our wildlife.” Interested students can message the Facebook page directly or email jessica-smith-7@uiowa.edu to send their photos to a museum designer.

Kansas

Wichita: A new government report says the state’s winter wheat crop is maturing more slowly than usual. The National Agricultural Statistics Service reported this week that about 14% of the wheat has now headed. That is near what it was a year ago but well behind the 41% average for the date. The agency also rated wheat condition as 10% poor to very poor, 32% in fair shape, and 58% in good to excellent condition. Growers have also seeded about 41% of their corn acreage, behind the 51% that is normally in the ground by this time. Planting of soybean and sorghum crops in Kansas is just getting underway, with progress at or near the average.

Kentucky

Louisville: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s re-election campaign is capitalizing on a fellow Republican’s attack, selling “Cocaine Mitch” shirts on his campaign’s website. The shirts appear to have been hot sellers. The Kentucky Republican’s campaign Twitter account said Wednesday that McConnell was closing in on one of his biggest fundraising days of the year and thanked people who chipped in by purchasing shirts. The shirt shows a faceless figure with a sprinkling of cocaine on the side. It says “Mitch” on the front and “cartel member” on the back. The Senate leader’s campaign is laughing off an attack by ex-coal executive and failed Senate candidate Don Blankenship, who called him “Cocaine Mitch” after a magazine article alleged drugs were found aboard a cargo ship owned by the family of McConnell’s wife, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.

Louisiana

Baton Rouge: A proposal to exempt diapers and tampons from the state sales tax stalled Wednesday in the Senate, only to be revived later in a different form and successfully sent to the House for debate. Sen. J.P. Morrell, a New Orleans Democrat, proposed a constitutional change to remove the 4.45% state sales tax from diapers and feminine hygiene products starting in 2021. Senators refused to include that exemption in the state constitution. The Senate voted 21-12 for the measure, but it needed 26 votes to pass because constitutional amendments require a two-thirds vote. But later in the day, after stymieing the constitutional change, senators agreed to include the tax break in statute. That law change passed in a 29-5 vote, moving to the House for consideration. Morrell said the items are essential to women and children, in line with prescription drugs, which are exempt from sales tax.

Maine

Augusta: The governor is bringing back the state’s Children’s Cabinet in hopes of reducing youth drop-out, recidivism and incarceration rates. Gov. Janet Mills says in a Thursday announcement that she wants to focus on helping Maine children succeed in school, enter the workforce and live healthy lives. The governor says 37 towns of the top 50 with the highest poverty rates in New England in 2010 were located in Maine. She says 1 in 6 Maine children is living in poverty. The Children’s Cabinet dates back to 1996 and last met in 2010. The cabinet has urged Maine to expand quality and accessible early child care and education. Mills also wants to address the number of children suffering substantiated child abuse, which is up 25% from 2017 to 2018.

Maryland

Annapolis: Some Marylanders are at risk of having their driver’s licenses or identification cards recalled next month if they don’t soon satisfy document requirements that are part of the federally mandated Real ID process, according to a state agency. Some residents who have the new Real ID card still must bring in certain documentation to comply with the federal REAL ID requirement, according to a Thursday news release from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration. The overall deadline for obtaining a Real ID is Oct. 1, 2020, but more than 66,300 people with a new Real ID star license or identification card have not yet filed the required documents, the release says. Without action, MVA says, administrators will start flagging the affected driver’s licenses and identification cards in June as “recalled,” which would result in confiscation if drivers get pulled over.

Massachusetts

Dartmouth: The federal government says a program that sells scallops to pay for marine science will include a study of how shellfish harvesting affects sea turtles in this year’s projects. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the Atlantic Sea Scallop Research Set-Aside will help pay for 13 projects in 2019 and 2020. Regulators use the program to set aside more than a million pounds of scallops, generating millions of dollars for the science projects. Fishermen and scientists collaborate on the program. This year’s awards include a pair to the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth to use underwater cameras to get a better handle on East Coast scallop population health. The award to study sea turtles is slated to go to the Coonamessett Farm Foundation and Roger Williams University.

Detroit: There’s one more sign a riverfront concert venue has been renamed after Aretha Franklin. Workers on Thursday were taking down the Chene Park sign outside the venue and putting up one reflecting the name change. It features a stylized signature of the Queen of Soul’s first name. Mayor Mike Duggan told mourners at Franklin’s funeral in August that the name would be changed to Aretha Franklin Amphitheatre, saying that “when Aretha Franklin sang, it sounded like the voice of Detroit.” Days later, City Council unanimously approved it. The facility is known for its outdoor stage and summer concerts, and it hosted a Franklin tribute show last summer. She performed at Chene Park in 2015 to celebrate its 30th anniversary. The 2019 season starts in June. Franklin died Aug. 16 at 76.

Minnesota

St. Paul: Lawmakers are trying to get their hands around skyrocketing drug costs and the pharmaceutical industry that sets the prices. Bills are moving to tackle the problem, from anti-price gouging efforts to new reporting requirements for drug companies when prices spike. Minnesota Public Radio reports that nearly all those bills have been tucked into House and Senate budget bills and are heading into final negotiations. The bipartisan push has been fueled by personal stories. Nicole Smith-Holt has been a regular around the Capitol, talking about her son Alec Smith, a diabetic who died at age 26 because he was rationing insulin that he couldn’t afford. Both the House and Senate health and human services budgets include assistance for emergency insulin supplies, but their different approaches need to be reconciled.

Mississippi

Biloxi: A police officer helped a driver out of a wrecked sports car and told the man he was “lucky to be alive.” Less than an hour later, the officer was killed by another person who walked up and shot him outside the police station. Biloxi police records show Patrolman Robert McKeithen responded to a crash Sunday night and then returned to the station because he had gotten a flat tire. The driver, Damon Corrigan, 22, told the Sun Herald that McKeithen also accompanied him to a hospital. He says he was shocked to learn the officer had been killed. “The only thing I remember him telling me was that I was so lucky to be alive,” Corrigan told the newspaper. “He was so nice. I felt so bad.” McKeithen, 57, had worked for Biloxi Police Department for almost 24 years.

Missouri

Jefferson City: Republicans in the state House are backing away from a budget compromise that would allow colleges and universities to charge in-state tuition to students living in the country illegally. The GOP-led House on Thursday voted 110-43 against the deal. That means a panel of lawmakers will get another shot to negotiate on the policy and the proposed state budget for public colleges and universities. Missouri schools currently face losing state funding if they offer those students anything less than the tuition rate charged to international students. Bipartisan Senate and House negotiators earlier this week agreed to end that policy. But opposition from House Republicans could unravel the deal. Lawmakers face a Friday deadline to pass the budget.

Montana

Helena: Gov. Steve Bullock has signed a bill to continue the state’s Medicaid expansion program for another six years, as long as federal funding continues. He was joined at Thursday’s signing ceremony by bill sponsor Republican Rep. Ed Buttrey and Democratic Rep. Mary Caferro, who sponsored a separate bill that did not pass. The program provides health insurance to about 95,000 low-income adults. Buttrey’s bill adds work requirements, strengthens an asset test and increases premiums for people who stay on the program for more than two years. Bullock on Thursday also vetoed a bill that sought to give regulatory backing to insurance companies so they could negotiate better contracts with pharmacy benefit managers for policies sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Bullock argued the legislation could lead to higher costs.

Nebraska

Lincoln: A judge is considering his verdict in a lawsuit that says six convenience stores along Interstate 80 in the state posted misleading signs about prices. A nonjury trial was held last in week in Lincoln in a February 2017 lawsuit filed by several individuals and the Coalition for Ethical Petroleum Marketing. It accuses North Platte-based Wilkinson Development of violating the Nebraska Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Nebraska Consumer Protection Act. Wilkinson is accused of advertising low prices to attract travelers to its Fat Dog stores but then selling gas at those prices only at a limited number of pumps, intentionally hoping travelers accidentally filled up with more expensive fuel. The company president has denied the accusation.

Nevada

Las Vegas: An unusually wet stretch of showers and thunderstorms may help Sin City surpass its yearly average for rainfall this week. And it’s not even monsoon season yet. Since January, the National Weather Service has logged 3.8 inches of rainfall in Las Vegas – a few thimbles away from the yearly average of 4.19 inches. “Getting over (4.19 inches) isn’t impossible,” says meteorologist Kate Guillet. “We’re just going to have to wait and see.” The National Weather Service estimates a quarter to a half an inch of rain could fall on the Las Vegas Valley between Thursday and Sunday – and higher amounts are possible.

New Hampshire

Portsmouth: As some states and communities have slowly begun to acknowledge their often purposeful erasure of Native Americans from the dominant narrative, the voices, cultures and histories of the Abenaki and Wabanaki peoples were recently given a rightful home in the oldest “neighborhood” settled by Europeans in what’s now the state of New Hampshire. “People of the Dawnland,” an exhibit at the Jones House Family Discover Center in the 1600s Puddle Dock neighborhood, opens this month. The neighborhood, now known as the outdoor Strawbery Banke Museum, did in fact have remnants of indigenous people, such as pottery, projectile points and tent holes, discovered by archaeologists, but the museum has previously largely focused its efforts on the colonial aspects of the early settlement.

New Jersey

Atlantic City: The state’s beaches, casinos, forests and cities attracted tourists who spent nearly $45 billion last year. Gov. Phil Murphy says tourism spending in New Jersey has increased for nine years in a row. Speaking at a tourism conference Thursday in Trenton, Murphy said the tourism industry generated $5 billion in state and local taxes in 2018. He said about 111 million people visited the Garden State last year, up more than 7% from the previous year. Tourism is the state’s seventh-largest industry, supporting nearly 334,000 jobs. When indirect jobs, such as those that supply the industry, are included, the figure rises to more than 531,000 jobs. Food and beverages and lodging accounted for the largest share of tourism spending.

New Mexico

Santa Fe: World-premiere operas derived from the gender-bending Broadway hit “M. Butterfly” and from meditations on Victorian-era repression in Bram Stroker’s “Dracula” are coming to the Santa Fe Opera and its open-air stage in the high desert. Opera General Director Robert Meya on Wednesday announced upcoming productions for 2020 that include retooled staples such as “Il Barbiere di Siviglia” (“The Barber of Seville”) and the revival of Tim Albery’s version of Mozart’s “Die Zauberflöte” (“The Magic Flute”). In recent years, Santa Fe has been the backdrop for productions about the dawn of the nuclear age in 1940s New Mexico and a world premiere of a techno-infused opera about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg has been a regular visitor to performances in Santa Fe.

New York

New York: Anna Sorokin, the German con artist who passed herself off as a wealthy heiress to swindle banks, hotels and friends, was sentenced Thursday to four to 12 years behind bars. New York Judge Diane Kiesel said at the sentencing hearing that she was “stunned by the depth of the defendant’s deception” and turned down a request by Sorokin’s lawyers that she be sentenced to time she has already spent in jail awaiting trial. Sorkin, 28, was convicted last month on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services and has been in custody since her October 2017 arrest. Sorokin went by Anna Delvey when she defrauded financial institutions and Manhattan celebrity circles into believing she had a fortune of about $67 million overseas that could cover her jet-setting lifestyle, high-end clothing and lavish hotel stays.

Murphy: The U.S. Forest Service is proposing one of the largest timber sales in the nearly 100-year history of the Nantahala National Forest, and the public comment period ends Friday. The proposal, known as the Buck Project, is drawing concern from conservation groups worried about harmful effects of logging and road building in this “special place” of potential wilderness and old-growth areas. But it is being welcomed by others who say it will improve forest health and wildlife habitat in forest areas long overdue for a trim. The Buck Project, which includes a timber sale as well as forest restoration activities including prescribed burns and stream improvement projects, would take place in a 20,638-acre analysis area in southeastern Clay County, in the Tusquitee Ranger District of Nantahala, the state’s largest and most western forest.

North Dakota

Bismarck: Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner says lawmakers may be called back into session over legislation that limits the powers of the state auditor. The Legislature passed a measure late in the session that requires the auditor’s office to get lawmakers’ permission to conduct “performance audits.” The amendment was put in the auditor’s budget that passed unanimously in the Senate and by a large margin in the House. Wardner says he didn’t know the amendment had been put in the budget bill and thinks other senators didn’t, either. Wardner says he and House Minority Leader Chet Pollert will meet with Auditor Josh Gallion next week to discuss the issue and how it will affect the agency. Leaders can recall the Legislature if they haven’t used all their allotted days.

Ohio

Columbus: Voters in the capital have agreed to let the city take on as much as $1 billion more in debt to pay for renovations to roads and bridges, underground utilities and other infrastructure. Near the top of spending among issues approved Tuesday is a new municipal courthouse, estimated to cost about $130 million. Voters also approved reserving $50 million for affordable housing as Columbus prepares for a regional plan to address what experts say is a 54,000-unit shortage. The Columbus Dispatch reports this is the largest bond package approved since 2008, when voters passed a $1.7 billion debt plan, mostly to pay for water and sewer projects. The projects won’t raise taxes, but the city could raise property taxes if it can’t repay the debt.

Oklahoma

Oklahoma City: A former U.S. soldier from the state who was pardoned this week for his 2009 conviction for killing an Iraqi prisoner says he initially didn’t answer the White House’s phone call to tell him of the pardon. Former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna says he was on the phone with his father, retired FBI agent Scott Behenna, when the call came about 2:30 p.m. Monday as he was driving. He didn’t recognize the number and thought it might be a telemarketer, so he let it go to voicemail. After checking his messages, he returned the call and was told President Donald Trump was granting him a pardon and would call him back. When Behenna’s phone rang again, it was Trump’s office putting the president on the line so he could tell Behenna personally. He was convicted in 2009 of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone in the 2008 killing of Ali Mansur Mohamed, an unarmed Iraqi prisoner.

Oregon

Portland: A bill to allow dentists in the state to administer vaccines to patients has been signed into law. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Oregon is the first state in the country to allow dentists to administer any vaccine available at a primary care doctor’s office. Most people may not get their measles, polio and tetanus shots from the dentist, but Oregon Health & Science University School of Dentistry Dean Phillip Marucha says they might want vaccines relevant to oral health such as HPV. He says a large percentage of new oral cancer diagnoses are linked to HPV, a sexually transmitted infection that can also cause cervical cancer and genital warts. Marucha said this law allows a dentist to educate patients about the value of the HPV vaccine and then administer it onsite.

Pennsylvania

Harrisburg: The State Board of Education is giving its support to proposals by Gov. Tom Wolf to require students start schooling by age 6 and continue until they’re at least 18. The board voted unanimously Wednesday for the Democratic governor’s proposals that he unveiled in February. The Republican-controlled Legislature still must approve the proposals for them to take effect. The Wolf administration says lowering the mandatory start age from 8 to 6 would affect about 3,300 children. Officials say only one other state allows parents to keep children out of school until age 8, a policy Pennsylvania adopted in the late 19th century. Pennsylvania’s minimum age to drop out of school is currently 17. The administration says nearly 14,000 students drop out without graduating every year in Pennsylvania.

Rhode Island

Providence: The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island has sued the state on behalf of nonfiction writers, saying a sales tax exemption for authors is unconstitutional because it only applies to works of fiction. The federal suit filed Tuesday argues that making a distinction between fiction and nonfiction violates the First Amendment’s guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. A state law enacted in 2013 exempts from the sales tax “original and creative works” sold by writers, composers and artists residing in Rhode Island. The ACLU says the state’s taxation agency has concluded that nonfiction books are not “original and creative works.” A Department of Revenue spokesman said in a statement that the department had not received notice of the lawsuit and does not comment on pending litigation.

South Carolina

Columbia: The state Senate has agreed to provide $120 million in tax breaks to the Carolina Panthers to move their practice fields and team headquarters out of North Carolina. The 27-15 vote Thursday came after contentious debate, with several senators questioning whether public money should be given to a billionaire NFL owner and saying the $3.8 billion proposed economic benefit of the new facility is wildly exaggerated. The bill, enthusiastically backed by Gov. Henry McMaster, would exempt the Panthers from paying state income taxes for players, coaches and other employees for 15 years as long as they use the money to build their new complex near Rock Hill. The team will continue to play games 15 miles north in Charlotte, North Carolina. McMaster is expected to quickly sign the bill.

South Dakota

Aberdeen: The latest federal census of agriculture finds the number of farms in the state has dropped. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 2017 census, South Dakota’s farmland was worked by fewer farming operations from 2012 to 2017. The census is conducted every five years. Statewide, more than 43 million acres were operated as farms. But there were 2,000 fewer farming operations in the state in 2017 than in 2012. The Aberdeen News reports the biggest drop came from farms operating between 10 and 1,000 acres. That number dropped by 1,850 over those five years. Nate Franzen, president of the Ag Banking Division at First Dakota National Bank based in Yankton, cites several reasons why farming operations are going out of business, including retirement, financial struggles and other business opportunities.

Memphis: The National Civil Rights Museum is being honored by a federal agency that supports the nation’s museums. The Institute of Museum and Library Services said in a news release Tuesday that the Memphis-based museum is one of 10 recipients of National Medal for Museum and Library Service. Institute officials say the award honors museums and libraries that make exceptional contributions to their communities. Opened in 1991, the museum is built on the site of the former Lorraine Motel. Civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was fatally shot while standing on the hotel’s balcony April 4, 1968. The museum chronicles the history of the U.S. civil rights movement and holds discussions and events related to civil and human rights issues.

Texas

Dallas: Electricity demand is expected to hit record levels this summer, and with a thin margin of reserve power, the operator of the state’s grid says it may have to ask businesses and consumers to conserve. Officials at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas are not ruling out rolling blackouts, although they say other measures are more likely, including importing power from other grids. ERCOT predicted Wednesday that demand in the state will rise as high as 74,853 megawatts. That’s 1,300 megawatts higher than the record set last July 19. The grid operator predicts demand will grow at an above-normal rate of 2.5% to 3% every year through 2022. Demand is booming partly because of growing West Texas oil and gas operations and industrial development along the Gulf Coast.

Utah

Salt Lake City: A popular three-day music festival featuring the likes of rapper G-Eazy has been canceled after state officials refused to grant a liquor license. The Salt Lake Tribune reports the authorities cited past drug and alcohol-related violations in refusing to grant a permit for the Bonanza Campout, which was canceled Wednesday. The 4-year-old event had been scheduled for June 21-23 near Heber City, about 45 miles east of Salt Lake City. It would have presented 36 artists, including electronic-music producer DJ Snake and Australian pop-rock duo Empire of the Sun. Organizers said in a statement that all ticket and lodging purchases for the event will be refunded and that they plan to have the festival again in 2020.

Vermont

Montpelier: Lawmakers are considering steps to make it easier for prison inmates to reduce the length of their sentences through good behavior or acts of heroism. The previous “good time” system was repealed in 2005 because it was thought to be too complex. Corrections Commissioner Mike Touchette says Vermont is one of a handful of states that lacks a good time program. Currently only prison work-camp inmates can earn shorter sentences. The Legislature is considering a number of proposals. One would allow inmates and offenders on furlough to earn a five-day sentence reduction for every month without a major discipline violation. Touchette says providing incentives for good behavior and rewarding that good behavior is “much more effective” than pure punishment.

Virginia

Richmond: Gov. Ralph Northam has proclaimed May “Second Chance Month” in a bid to focus attention on criminal justice reform and inmate re-entry programs. Northam said in a statement Wednesday that redemption is a “fundamental American value” and that his administration is committed to making sure that former inmates have the support they need to succeed. The governor’s proclamation comes a few months after he asked Virginians for a second chance following a blackface scandal that almost forced him from office. Northam has since prioritized efforts to address long-standing racial inequities, particularly those related to the criminal justice system. The Democratic governor was recently able to overcome strong opposition from key GOP lawmakers and eliminate the suspension of driver’s licenses for motorists with unpaid court fines and costs.

Washington

Spokane: A state official says wolves should be removed from the federal endangered species list in the entirety of the state. Washington Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind in April wrote a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in support of the proposal to delist wolves in the Lower 48 states. Susewind calls the proposal “appropriate and timely” as wolves are recovering. Wolves in the eastern third of Washington are already delisted. The Center for Biological Diversity criticized the letter, saying the idea of stripping federal protections from wolves is “appalling.” The environmental group contends 72% of Washington residents want federal protection. The federal government has already delisted wolves in the eastern third of Washington and Oregon, as well as in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.

West Virginia

Clay: A new rail trail is set to be built in the state. Gov. Jim Justice announced Wednesday that the state has signed a letter of intent to purchase land for the project. The trail will use 72 miles of existing rail lines in Clay and Kanawha counties, along the Elk River and Buffalo Creek. Justice says the tracks will be converted into trails for walking, hiking, biking or other recreational purposes. He says the project could become the second-longest rail trail east of the Mississippi. Justice says the he hopes portions of the trail will be up and running by summer 2020.

Wisconsin

West Allis: A plate of eggs stole the attention of social media this week when the president’s favorite TV show, “Fox and Friends,” broadcast from a local diner. Johnny V’s says the plate of a whopping 10 sunny side up eggs that appeared in front of a man deriding politicians’ plans for “free this, free that” was actually part of its King of Johnny V’s breakfast special, which also includes eight huge pancakes, a pound of hash browns, three pieces of bacon, three pieces of sausage, a piece of ham and Texas toast. If a single person can finish it in an hour, they get the meal and a T-shirt free. They also get their picture posted on a wall. The staff was hoping the King challenge would get a shout-out from the Fox TV host, but time apparently didn’t allow for it.

Jackson: National forest managers in the western part of the state expect to see large numbers of mushroom hunters in the weeks ahead. Forests that have recently burned are prime places to look for tasty morel mushrooms. A large area of Bridger-Teton National Forest that burned in 2018 could be prime hunting grounds. Morels also like wet weather, and the region has received plenty of rain and snow this spring. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports forest officials have implemented a $300 fee for morel hunters who sell their finds. They will only allow commercial morel hunting in the northern part of the Roosevelt Fire burn area. Recreational morel hunters can hunt anywhere in the forest for free but may not collect more than 3 gallons of morels.

"UF student, 22, charged with sexual battery","A Gainesville man accused of sexually battering a woman on March 22 after spending time in a bar was arrested by the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office.

Maxim Emilio Portillo, 22, of 6418 SW 90th St., was charged with one count of sexual battery, according to an arrest report.

The woman told authorities she has known Portillo for about five years and they went to school together. They were at a bar with two of Portillo’s friends.

She told deputies she had two drinks, well within her tolerance level. However, she became ill and disoriented. She vomited in the bathroom. The group left in an Uber, but she became sick again so the Uber driver let her and Portillo out.

Portillo hailed a Lyft. The driver told deputies the woman was extremely intoxicated and that he had to stop so she could vomit. Portillo also seemed drunk but was steady on his feet, the driver said. They were eventually dropped off at Portillo’s home.

The woman told authorities he sexually battered her there, first on his sister’s bed and then on a couch in the room, where he reportedly put a pillow over her face. She said she repeatedly told him to stop.

""The victim was so impaired she was unable to resist the defendant's attack and unable to give consent to sexual activity,"" the report said.

Under questioning, Portillo reportedly admitted the woman was impaired that night and that he'd had sex with her.

INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — A Vero Beach man was arrested Tuesday after biting into a deputy's arm during a traffic stop, according to an arrest report.

Edward Lejon Thompson, 23, faces three counts of battery on a law enforcement officer and depriving an officer of means of communication, resisting arrest with violence and two counts of corruption by threat, among other charges.

He was being held Wednesday at the Indian River County Jail on $45,000 bail.

The incident happened about 8 p.m., during a traffic stop for a busted headlight on 45th Street near U.S. 1.

Deputies said Thompson kicked and scratched as he was taken to the ground, knocking away their radios.

He continued to kick, threaten and throw things during a medical clearance at Cleveland Clinic Indian River Hospital before going to jail, the report said.

Indian River County Sheriff's officials did not return a request for an update on the injured deputy's condition Wednesday.

Documents detail 'severe injuries' in abuse of toddler; two face charges,"Clayton Pafford is one of two people charged in connection with the abuse of a toddler who suffered ""severe injuries."" The girl's mother, Heather Reid was also arrested. (Photo: Leon County Detention Facility)

The mother of a 2-year-old girl noticed injuries to her child every time she left her alone with her live-in boyfriend.

Leon County Sheriff’s Office investigators were made aware Monday of a possible child abuse incident when the girl was transported to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare with severe injuries.

Her brain was bleeding in two places. She had liver lacerations. Both her ears were bruised. She had cuts and abrasions on her hip, face and arms.

The girl’s mother, 26-year-old Heather Reid, was arrested after being questioned by detectives. She faces charges of child neglect and neglect with great bodily harm.

She told detectives she heard a thud come from the other room and believed the girl had fallen out of bed. After answering that only she and another man were at the house, she backtracked and said that her boyfriend, Clayton Pafford, was also home.

Heather Reid, 26, was arrested on charges of child neglect and neglect with great bodily harm. (Photo: Leon County Detention Facility)

She said Monday was not the first time she noticed the child with injuries.

“She noticed every time she leaves (her) alone with Clayton, she would return home and discover more injuries,” according to court records.

Reid said she didn't report previous injuries she believed were connected with Pafford because she was worried the toddler would be taken by the Florida Department of Children and Families.

The friend told LCSO he heard the same thud but that Reid wasn’t at the Crossway Court house when it happened. He saw Pafford, 23, come out of a bedroom with the toddler’s, bloody limp body. Pafford began calling Reid instead of for medical help.

The friend called 911 as Pafford left the home saying, “Don’t tell anyone I was here.”

Pafford, 23, was arrested Tuesday after leading law enforcement officials on a chase through Woodville. He faces charges of child neglect, aggravated battery on a child, kidnapping, hitting a police dog, aggravated assault of a police officer and multiple other charges stemming from fleeing officers.

LCSO deputies, along with members of the U.S. Marshals Violent Fugitive Task Force and the Florida Highway Patrol, searched for Pafford all night. He was finally located at about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday driving on Back Forest Road by a member of LCSO’s Special Projects Investigations Detection Enforcement Response Unit and members of the Florida Highway Patrol. When they tried to stop him, Pafford refused to stop and fled.

Persuing deputies and troopers used stop sticks in the southbound travel lane of Old Woodville Highway, but Pafford swerved toward the deputy onto the St. Marks bike trail, narrowly missing him. Pafford turned back onto Old Woodville Highway and crossed over Bob Miller Road before troopers were able to stop his vehicle, LCSO reported.

Pafford, who had a passenger in his vehicle, refused to surrender. A LCSO K9 was used to take him into custody and after being treated at a local hospital was taken to the Leon County Detention Facility.

The couple was investigated by DCF last month when hospital staff noticed the toddler’s injuries.

In mid-April, staff at Capital Regional Medical Center noticed the girl was dirty, was covered in bug bites, had a bruise under her left eye and a bald spot on her head. The girl had a burn on her right hand and lesions on her body.

Staff members overheard Reid making alarming statements about not being able to take care of the girl and not caring if she was eating.

"A Look at John Singleton&#39;s Race Riot Film, &#39;Rosewood&#39;","Photo: Rob Kim (Getty Images for Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences)

Legendary filmmaker John Singleton was laid to rest this week after he passed away at the age of 51. Naturally, it has many reflecting on his filmography. For me, I’m specifically thinking about his most important film.

We know Singleton’s most famous works: Boyz n the Hood, Poetic Justice and the under-appreciated Higher Learning, a film that still rings true—just visit any predominately white college or university. But, to my mind, his magnum opus came next. A film that will probably not be deeply discussed in the wake of his going to be with the ancestors, but should.

Rosewood, released in 1997, dramatizes the 1923 massacre of an all-black town in Florida. John Singleton, at the height of his powers, shines a light on something that has been kept in the dark for too long, centering themes that are as timeless as racism in America.



We know the story. An economically struggling white town is next to an economically prosperous black town. A white woman in the white town is viciously attacked in her home by a man with whom she is having an affair, and instead of allowing her husband to discover the truth, she blames it on a black man, starting a chain of events that leads to white folks destroying the all-black town.

This is Singleton’s best, most mature work. Instead of judging this woman for her misdeeds, he is intentional about exploring the way patriarchy simultaneously deifies her as a victim of domestic violence while still viewing her through the lens of misogynistic suspicion. And despite the fact that few people believe what she says (characters say as much toward the end of the film), they still use her claims as an excuse to engage in brutal violence against the black people in the film. White people are viewed as a destructive, colonizing force—they only used her claim as a reason to unleash it.

That story resonated with me. The fact that a black man would be accused of sexual assault by a white woman is something I was warned about as a kid. From the age of 15 until I went off to college, my grandmother would tell me to “leave those white girls alone.” They “had a history of screaming rape” if things went wrong, she warned me. This was the first film I’d ever seen that dramatized this black urban legend to great effect—but that is not all Singleton wanted to say.



Esther Rolle gives the best performance in the film as Aunt Sara. If a white woman had played a role with as much conviction, this performance would have garnered, at least, an Academy Award nomination, and, at most, a win. She sees what happens, knows the truth and remains quiet. When she finally speaks the truth, she is shot and killed on her porch.



Singleton masterfully shows us how the psychological trauma of racism unwittingly causes black folks to participate in and internalize the violence that is visited upon us. In his portrayal of Aunt Sara, Singleton shows us how many of our matriarchs went to their graves holding the secrets of the white families they worked for and how those secrets can hurt and, at times, kill. A great deal of research has been done that explores how hypertension, cancer and other ailments are the result of this internalization.

Rosewood is not a perfect film. The performances from some of the young actors in the cast leave much to be desired and the movie could have been about 10 minutes shorter. But those are small quibbles. I simply do not understand how a film like Django Unchained was so successful while this shorter, more thoughtful film lost money at the box office. Perhaps it was because the former was a fantasy that did not indict white viewers while the latter told a story that happened all too often (especially during the Red Summer of 1919), and did not let its white viewers off the hook. America has not truly dealt with the race massacres that happened far too often early in the 20th century, and this filmmaker, aware of that, did his part to raise awareness.",https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/a-look-at-rosewood-john-singletons-most-ambitious-film-1834394923,2019-05-08T14:30:00Z,The Root,"605 3rd Avenue 12th Floor New York, NY 10158"
"Pensacola police K-9s send gift basket of toys, treats to injured SRSO K-9","CLOSE SRCO K-9 returns after injuries sustained apprehending burglary suspect Colin Warren-Hicks, Pensacola

The Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office K-9 who was seriously injured in a robbery attempt in April is smiling wide these days.

Not only is Orkon giddy to be back catching bad guys with the SRSO, but the dog is grinning because he received get-well gift baskets from his fellow K-9 pals at the Pensacola Police Department.

""It was really awesome, man,"" said SRSO Sgt. Rich Aloy, who was present Monday when several PPD officers and K-9s personally presented Orkon with baskets full of toys and treats. ""To just show the inter-agency partnership, it's just gestures like that that mean a lot to our agency, and to the K-9 agency.""

Chew toys, Frisbees and tennis balls were stuffed into a small basket with Orkon's name written across the front.

Photos show the before and after shots of a gift basket delivery from the Pensacola Police Department K-9 agency to the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office K-9 injured on duty last month. (Photo: Courtesy of the Pensacola Police Department)

A note attached to the basket that was ""signed"" by seven PPD K-9's playfully read:

""Wer happ to hear ur back at work. We had the hoomans box up some of our farrit toys and treets. Hope you like dem. We destroyed our Frisbee in 43 seconds — see if you can beat dat. — Janus, Kojo, Nashoba, Mia, Foster, Meeko, and Cross.""

""That's just what you do to support one another,"" PPD spokesman Mike Wood said. ""More than anything, we were just glad that the dog is OK.""

While responding to a reported burglary in Milton, Orkon was repeatedly punched by a suspect on April 9. The dog was rushed to an emergency animal treatment facility to undergo surgery after suffering a contusion to his eye and lacerations to his leg.

Orkon rested up on the sidelines for two weeks before returning to the force in late April.

How to keep your cooling bill down when the summer heats up,"- As high temperatures move in for the summer Floridians are looking for ways to stay cool.

New homeowner and owner of Central Florida Home Pros Residential Real Estate John MacFarlane is keeping the heat out of his Volusia County home by installing window films.

“The afternoon sun was extremely blazing and bright and you could just feel the heat pouring in through the windows,” MacFarlane said.

He hired Tint Man Incorporated to install the tint on his home windows.

“Basically from time change to time change [we’re] completely slammed,” said the company’s president, Shawn Mangrum.

Mangrum said his team installs window films on 5-10 residential and commercial properties every week and they stay busy installing tint on car windows every day.

“[The tint is] going to get rid of your radiant heat. The radiant heat is the heat around your windows. So window films can reject over 80 percent of that radiant heat,” Mangrum said. “Then you have infrared heat. That’s when the sun is coming directly through the windows, like if you’re eating dinner and you’re just uncomfortable, well you can get rid of the infrared heat by up to 98 percent.”

Mangrum said many people do not think about tinting home windows because of a common misconception.

“People think of tint and you have to go really dark. The darker you go, the more heat you cut out. That’s actually very untrue for both your home and vehicle.”

He said tinting can keep cars and homes cooler and lower power bills.

Duke Energy Florida Spokesperson Ana Gibbs said homeowners can make minor adjustments in their homes to keep it cool during the summer.

“We recommend during the summer you keep your AC at around 78 degrees.”

Gibbs said homeowners can lower their power bill by making the difference between the inside and outside temperatures as small as possible. She also recommends maintaining HVAC units and regularly changing the air filters.

Gibbs said only use ceiling fans when you are in a room. Using them could allow people to raise the thermostat by as much as four degrees. She recommends turning off the fan if you leave a room.

Duke Energy also recommends the following tips to stay cool during the summer:

● Close blinds and curtains on sunny days.

● If you have a whole-house fan, use it to pull cool air into your home at night or in the early morning through open windows. Turn the fan off and shut the windows during the day.

● Use bathroom and kitchen fans to remove heat and humidity caused by showering and cooking. (And take short showers instead of baths to save even more year-round.)

● Run your dishwasher, washing machine and dryer at night when it’s cooler. Run full loads. Consider air drying dishes and clothes to save even more.

● If you’re going on vacation, the Duke Energy energy slayer calculator can show you how much you’ll save (duke-energy.com/EnergyVampire) by unplugging appliances you’re not using while you’re away.

Rent in Titusville and Melbourne,"Every year at this time – the end of the theatrical season – Steven J Heron, artistic director of the Titusville Playhouse (TPI), and now the Henegar Center, engages in a bit of self-indulgence. It comes in the form of plays that give audiences the chance to see what local actors can do with drama.

They are plays Heron loves, and no play does he love better than “Rent.” It will be presented May 10 through June 7 at the Emma Parrish Theatre, and June 7 through 16 at the Henegar. This year, having spent the last several months commuting between downtown Titusville and downtown Melbourne, said self-indulgence is more than warranted.

The pop culture favorite musical ""Rent"" begins tonight at Titusville Playhouse. (Photo: Photo by Niko Stamos)

“It’s been hectic because we’re spread so thin,” he said, referring to TPI staffers who have joined him in going from one theater to the other. “Once we get this season finished, things should be better.”

Still, for Heron, things cannot be better than “Rent.” The Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize-winning musical based on “La Boheme” in this case the story of young Bohemians living in New York City that addresses poverty, art, love and AIDS.

‘“Rent’ was the first show I ever became obsessed with,” Heron said. “I saw it 15 times with the original cast and I saw it Off-Broadway before it moved uptown.”

It “changed the face of Broadway,” he added. “I don’t think we’d have ‘Hamilton’ if we did not have ‘Rent.”

It also is personal.

“When I moved to New York in 1992, being from the South, I was the one who was . . . different, and so it appealed to me, as it did to so many others,” he said. “It was my generation’s ‘Spring Awakening,’ my generation’s ‘South Pacific.’ But more important, it meant so much because, having had the experience of friends suffer and pass away from AIDS. When I lived in New York, gay society was dealing with it better than anyone else.”

Heron, who never has tested positive for HIV, dealt with it directly, as a volunteer at the famed David Geffen Center for HIV Prevention and Health Education.

""Rent"" moves from Titusville Playhouse to The Henegar Center in Melbourne on June 7. (Photo: Photo by Niko Stamos)

“We did whatever was necessary, and they would pair volunteers with patients. I learned a lot there,” he said.

Still, what a generation that cannot remember or fail to understand the significance of the AIDS crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s – people of the age to portray characters in “Rent” – bothers him.

“They really don’t realize how pervasive it was, how destructive,” he said softly. “An entire generation of artists was lost.”

“Rent” at TPI and Henegar elicits anything but sadness, though. Heron, always ebullient, is nothing short of elated about how it is working out.

“Are people excited about this?” he asked. “We had 96 people audition for the show, which has a cast of 15. It is incredible.”

The cast, he called, “freaking spectacular. They came in with a sense of the show because they’re so familiar with it.”

Little will change after the show moves to Henegar, either; it will have the same cast, the same set, the same almost everything, with a few technical exceptions because of the way Henegar is built. And after its run finishes, Henegar will be a bit different too.

Heron would love to paint the interior of the 99-year-old building, though that may have to wait in favor of other improvements. Orchestra seating will be stripped out and replaced with wider seats; the stage will have been extended.

“We’d love to make changes that our audiences will appreciate because they will be more comfortable,” he said. “Will we lose a few seats? Yes, but people who come to the theater will understand.”

People who come to either theater will understand why “Rent” will close the season too.

“It is just phenomenal,” Heron said. “Everything about it is incredible. Come see ‘Rent.’”

A Florida man snapped a picture of a Disney bus that was covered in love bugs.





The good news is that lovebugs are not harmful to humans. The species originated in Central America and got their name because they are known to fly around in mating pairs. They migrated through Texas and Louisana before coming to Florida. They continue to expand and can be found as far north as South Carolina.

Love bugs are especially common in Florida because of the heat and decomposing plant debris. University of Florida scientists believe that lovebugs confuse those odors with chemicals in exhaust fumes, explaining why we see so many of them around highways.

In fact, most people see lovebugs as splatters on windshields and hoods. They can damage your car’s paint if not cleaned off.

Orange County man said stranger yelled anti-Semitic insults at him while he was landscaping,"ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - An Orange County homeowner said a woman drove onto his private property causing damage to his landscaping while hurling anti-Semitic insults.

Jeff Gelman said the incident happened Saturday while he was having breakfast with his wife and believes the woman drove in through an unlocked gate.

“We looked out to window and we saw someone doing donuts in our backyard, right there,” Gelman said.

Gelman said he has never seen the woman before.

Orange County Sheriff's deputies identified the woman as Kristen Kelly. The 45-year-old Winter Garden woman is accused of verbally attacking the Gelmans at at one point trying to run them over with her Dodge SUV.

“She was yelling, go home Jew tell your neighbors that Jesus Christ is here and that I’m going to clean some dirty Jews,” Gelman said.

Gelman said he snapped pictures of the woman and her vehicle to help authorities catch her.

“We didn’t recognize her at all; never saw her in our lives.”

The Windermere father said things got worse when he and his wife tried approaching Kelly to ask her to get off their property.

“When she got out of the car she sprayed us with detergent and said ‘cleaning the dirty Jews,’” Gelman said.

Kelly is charged with aggravated assault and is being held at the Orange County jail.

- It’s not every day an alligator is pulled out of someone’s pants during a traffic stop. But that’s exactly what one Florida woman did, according to local authorities.

Two Charlotte County sheriff’s deputies watched a woman pull a foot-long alligator out of her yoga pants Monday morning. She also had dozens of turtles hidden in a backpack.

According to the sheriff’s office report, the deputies were handling traffic enforcement in Punta Gorda, Florida, when they observed a blue 2013 Chevrolet pickup truck blow through a stop sign around 3:15 a.m.

The deputies pulled the vehicle over and approached a man driving the truck with a female passenger. The man, identified as 22-year-old Michael Cody Clemons, did not have his driver’s license on him but provided his vehicle registration and proof of insurance.

One of the deputies then asked the passenger for her license. She was identified as 25-year-old Ariel Michelle Marchan-Le Quire.

Not to be outdone by #Floridaman, a #FloridaWoman pulled this alligator out of her pants this morning during traffic stop after being asked the standard ""Do you have anything else?"" She also had 41 3-stripe turtles in the car. @MyFWC responded to take over the investigation. pic.twitter.com/UdZsDBvh9f — Charlotte County Sheriff's Office (@CCSOFLSheriff) May 6, 2019

When deputies asked the man and woman where they were coming from, Clemons said they were under an overpass trying to collect frogs and snakes, according to the sheriff’s office report.

A deputy then asked the pair if they would open up their backpacks to make sure they hadn’t collected any protected wildlife. Clemons' bag contained clothes and other personal items, but when Marchan-Le Quire opened her bag, authorities discovered 41 three-stripe turtles in her possession.

When the pair were taken out of the vehicle, deputies asked Marchan-Le Quire if she had anything else on her and that’s when she pulled the alligator out of her yoga pants. She placed it in the bed of the truck.

Authorities contacted the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, who took over the investigation.

Florida man receives toll violation for license plate he owned 25 years ago,"PORT ORANGE, Fla. - A Port Orange man is frustrated that the Florida Department of Transportation continues to send a bill to his Central Florida home for two toll violations that happened in South Florida last August.

""I wasn't even in the state of Florida at the time,"" said Thomas McMullen.

McMullen said he was on vacation in Canandaigua, New York, when the toll violation happened. The vehicle captured by the toll cameras is a tractor-trailer, something McMullen says he's never owned.

Not only that, he said he has not owned the license plate captured in the photo for almost 25 years.

""I may have thrown it in the garbage. I may have sold it. I don't know,"" said McMullen, who is an avid classic car collector.

He said he has bought and sold more than 100 cars in his lifetime and doesn't keep track of all of them or the tags that went with them.



He only collects special licesnse plates, including a Purple Heart plate that hangs on the wall in his garage.

""You know, I'm a soldier, and I fought for our country,"" McMullen said. ""This is a DAV tag of mine for Disabled (American) Veteran.""

McMullen said he has also bought old license plates on eBay as part of his classic car obsession. He had no idea that the license plates assigned to him would stay linked to him all these years later.

""I mean, this tag is 25 years old,"" McMullen said. ""Why am I responsible for this?""

McMullen said he kept calling the state to dispute the charges, but they kept sending him a bill. He said he just wants SunPass to stop sending him these bills and to find out what really happened.

""It's giving me a lot of aggravation,"" said McMullen. ""And I don't need any aggravation.""

That's why he called News 6 .

The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles confirms the license plate expired in 1995 and has not been renewed. The agency confirms unless the plate is reported lost or stolen, it will remain active and continue to be linked to the original owner.

But once we started digging deeper into McMullen's case, we discovered another mystery. The license plate on the 18-wheeler captured on camera may not even be McMullen's old plate after all.

If you zoom in on the picture, you can clearly see that the second zero on the plate is not like the first.

McMullen said the FDOT picked up the anomaly, and within an hour of our visit, the agency called him to say the plate in the picture whad been altered, and that the agency was waiving the toll charges.



News 6 checked McMullen’s account and discovered the charge for $47.25 has been officially erased.



What can you do with your old plates?

According to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, license plates are issued to the person, not the vehicle. So, when conducting a private sale of a vehicle, license plates stay with the seller, not the vehicle.



In addition, if you are not going to renew your license plate, you can return it to any tax collector's office, mail it to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, destroy it, or keep it in a safe place where no one can access it.



If you are going to sell a car privately, take off the license plate. You can then mail it back to The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles so the agency can take it out of circulation.

The department offers a sellers checklist to help consumers protect themselves in a private sale:

Apply for a demonstration-only temporary tag, if needed;

Conduct a vehicle identification number inspection, if necessary;

Record odometer reading on title;

Complete title transfer in a motor vehicle service center.

Remove license plate from the sold vehicle;

Surrender the license plate, if applicable;

File a Notice of Sale, form HSMV 82050.

Visit the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles website to learn more about buying and selling a vehicle.

What happens if your license plate is lost or stolen?

When the FLHSMV a customer completes the form and provides a copy of a police report or agency card containing the case number, the replacement will be issued at no charge.

Questions or discrepancies found on your SunPass bill can be addressed online here.

"$4,000 Kay Jewelers ring set at center of fraud against Ponte Vedra man","PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. - Imagine getting a bill for more than $4,000 from a jewelry store you've never set foot in. That's what happened Thursday to a 72-year-old Ponte Vedra Beach man.

John Montgomery called the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office to report the bogus bill only to find out that the statement was from Progressive Leasing, stating that Montgomery had bought a bridal ring set valued at nearly $1,900.

The statement went on to read the payments would begin on May 15 and continue bi-weekly for 27 payments. The total amount with all charges added up was more than $4,000. Montgomery did not make the purchase or authorize it at a Kay Jeweler in Alabama.

When he called the company and spoke with a customer service representative, his account was closed and the case was referred to the Progressive Leasing fraud department.

Deputies urged Montgomery to contact Social Security to inform them his number had been compromised so he could take the proper security measures.

It happened at the Publix located in the 2100 block of Collier Parkway.

Deputies say the man's wife was at the cash register, checking out. The wife's purse was on the counter and fell to the ground.

Through the investigation, it appears that the wife carried a Derringer 2-shotgun in her purse which fired when the purse fell to the ground and a bullet struck the man's lower right shin.

Accusations of stolen cocaine escalated into kidnapping and torture over the weekend in Titusville, according to police reports.

Two men were arrested and charged with attempted murder and kidnapping. Police said the two beat and waterboarded a man after suspecting his friend had stolen cocaine from them Saturday.

Police were called about 12:30 a.m. Sunday when a battered man was admitted to the hospital, according to arrest reports. He had been pistol-whipped, waterboarded and force-fed dog food.



John Faulk, 27, of Titusville, and Steven Erickson, 24, of Cocoa, were charged with attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and inflicting harm on the person, robbery with a firearm and second-degree grand theft.

After a long day of drinking and using cocaine, the men believed their victim's friend had stolen cocaine from them before leaving to get food, police said. So they restrained the man's hands with tape and covered his nose and mouth with cloth before pouring water over his face, telling him to get his friend to return the cocaine or they would kill him.



They used table legs and a gun to beat him before uncovering his mouth to feed him dog food, police reported.

The torture lasted about 45 minutes before the man escaped to a nearby friend's house and then went to the hospital. Police said the suspects also stole the man's cell phone and over $800.

“The SWAT team responded with tactical measures and two suspects were taken into custody,” according to a statement from Amy Matthews, spokeswoman for the Titusville Police Department.

Matthews did not say what tactical measures were used when arresting Faulk and Erickson at the home.

No further information was available about the incidents Monday afternoon. The case remains an ongoing investigation.



Faulk is being held at the Brevard County Jail Complex in lieu of $115,000 bond. Erickson is being held in lieu of $122,000 bond.

US increases tariffs as China vows 'countermeasures',"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)

On the same morning that the U.S. more than doubled the rate of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, President Trump took to Twitter to declare that trade negotiations with China are progressing in a ""very congenial manner"" and falsely assert that the tariffs are going ""directly to the Treasury of the U.S.""

Experts say the president's claim that revenue from the tariffs flows to the U.S. Treasury is not true, and numerous fact checks, including one this week from FactCheck.Org, and an ABC News fact check from December, have found the same. In reality, most experts say, tariffs essentially amount to a tax on US importers, which in turn pass the cost on to consumers.

Digging in on his warring stance, the president expresses confidence in the efficacy of tariffs and reiterates that he is ready to take the conflict a step further, saying ""the process has begun to place additional Tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 Billion Dollars.""

The president's tweets expressing his comfort with staying the course in the escalating trade war come as Chinese negotiators are in Washington for two days of direct talks. While the president and his advisers had been expressing optimism in recent weeks that the trade war could be nearing an end as the U.S. and China closed in on a trade deal, the administration moved to impose increased tariffs over the last week following what the administration said was an attempt by China to make changes to the deal that had been negotiated.

The White House said talks would continue Friday after negotiators again sat down face-to-face in Washington Thursday evening.

""This evening, Ambassador [Robert] Lightizer and [Treasury] Secretary [Steven] Mnuchin met with President Trump to discuss the ongoing trade negotiations with China,"" White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said late Thursday. ""The Ambassador and Secretary then had a working dinner with Vice Premier Liu He, and agreed to continue discussions tomorrow morning at USTR.""

China's Ministry of Commerce followed, two minutes after midnight Eastern time, with a statement, saying, ""China deeply regrets that it will have to take necessary countermeasures.""

Trump's top trade negotiators, Lighthizer and Mnuchin, met with their Chinese counterparts for a meeting and working dinner that kicked off at 5 p.m. on Thursday.

Initially, a 100-person team from China was expected to travel to the nation's capital on Wednesday, but the Chinese were shaken by Trump's tweets and the talks were delayed by a day.

Administration officials were cautious about characterizing the meetings as the high stakes negotiations are still underway, but they are expected to meet again on Friday morning to continue discussions.

The meeting comes on the heels of the president unexpectedly announcing plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods -- ranging from textiles to chemicals -- from 10% to 25%.

China's Commerce Ministry said Wednesday that Beijing will retaliate if the U.S. actually imposes the tariffs.

""The escalation of trade friction is not in the interests of the people of the two countries and the people of the world,"" the ministry said. ""The Chinese side deeply regrets that if the US tariff measures are implemented, China will have to take necessary countermeasures.""

At a rally in Panama City Beach, Florida, the president accused the Chinese of ""cheating our workers and stealing their jobs.""

He added, ""So they are flying in the vice premier tomorrow is flying in, good man. But they broke the deal, they can't do that.""

On Thursday, the president told reporters that the United States and China were once ""very close to a deal,"" and then the Chinese began to ""re-negotiate.""

Despite the renewed trade war, the president said he has been in touch with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

""Well, he just wrote me a beautiful letter. I just received it,"" Trump said. ""And I’ll probably speak to him by phone.""",http://www.informnny.com/news/politics/us-increases-tariffs-as-china-vows-countermeasures-/1994423189,2019-05-10T14:12:53Z,INFORMNNY,"105 Court St, Watertown, NY 13601, USA"
"After Kentucky Derby uproar, its players fade into quiet routine of horse racing","

Luis Saez at Belmont Park on Friday. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post)

Just after the fifth race Thursday at Belmont Park, the 26-year-old jockey who had spent the last five days starring in a giant swirl of national discourse trudged off the track alone. Flecks of dirt had joined his silks and cap. He looked somewhat like a guy who had just finished fifth, which in fact he had. He walked alone and unbothered because, for one thing, so few people were there to watch.

Luis Saez, who finished first in the Kentucky Derby aboard Maximum Security before surreal disqualification just the weekend before, headed for the tunnel to the jockeys’ room, a reminder that horse racing’s bountiful eccentricities include the stark asymmetry between its big days and all the other days.

Ninety minutes prior, on a train with eight cars, a conductor had said, “You’re the only passenger.” The 3:40 p.m. from Jamaica in Queens to Belmont Park on the edge of Long Island rushed and then crawled and then stopped, all in 11 minutes. The doors opened to a revelation on the platform: There had been one other passenger.

Racing had begun at 3:05 on a workday. The other passenger walked the lonely outdoor concourse to the second-floor entrance to the 114-year-old track, only to find it locked. He muttered, then descended nearby stairs to open doors.

Belmont Park, with nine races on the card, felt ghostly.

Thursday counted as an extreme, with attendance almost countable — low triple digits? — and well more barren than a typical weekday. It also counted as a reminder. When jockeys and other horse people finish their occasional turns among psychedelic bacchanals with six-figure audiences such as last Saturday at the Kentucky Derby, they return to a day-to-day with a fraction of the fanfare and a collection of the fanatics.

[‘The worst thing you can do is rush’: Inside the strangest 22 minutes in Kentucky Derby history.]

Jockey John Velazquez, 47, laughed briefly at that thought and said: “There are hardcore customers, I’ll call it. They’re here every day, no matter what, whether it’s a big day or not. They’re the ones who come to the races all the time. So, yeah, so they’re the real fans, the real core business fans who come to watch the horses in the races, yeah.”

The sparse crowd seemed rich in those who do not concern themselves with, say, kale and quinoa. The pretzel stand looked lonely, if friendly; the IRS stands, unattended; the binocular-rental stand, untroubled. On the days when horse racing doesn’t dress itself up and garnish itself with flowers and fill the train platforms or parking lots — as Belmont Park itself will for the final leg of the Triple Crown on June 8 — the sport’s dilapidation relative to yore feels heightened.

Yet as usual in horse racing, names that gained nationwide notoriety from a historic, contentious Kentucky Derby were sprinkled throughout the entry charts of an anonymous Thursday, the dissimilarity a strain to comprehend: the same sport!

Race 5, purse $70,000, New York-bred 3 years old and up: Aboard entry No. 1, San Juan Diego, sat Saez. Aboard No. 5, Real Dan, rode Velazquez, whose Derby mount, Code of Honor, crossed the wire third and wound up second. Aboard No. 6, Five Star Bunt, there was Irad Ortiz Jr., fifth and then fourth in the Derby aboard Improbable; and on No. 7, Sicilia Mike, Jose Ortiz, fourth and then third in the Derby aboard Tacitus.

The trainer for No. 8, H Man, would be Jason Servis — not present at Belmont on Thursday — who just lived the otherworldly sequence of receiving congratulatory hugs for a Derby win that then did not occur. As happens at tracks day upon day in anonymous fifth races, there’s some noble stranger running, and here was the winner, 7-year-old gelding H Man: his 56th race, with 12 wins, 11 places and seven shows at four New York tracks since 2014. His sire, Musket Man, finished third in the 2009 Mine That Bird Kentucky Derby, and if you look at his performance charts until your eyes melt, you can spot seven trainers through H Man’s years, one of them twice, and claimed away twice.

“Nice horse,” said David Cannizzo, the Saratoga-based trainer who had H Man twice — for his first 14 races, then two more last winter. “Nice, solid, hard-knocking. . . . I claimed him back and lost him [back]. . . . Just a grinder.”

As for seeing him come and go, he said: “Part of the game. It makes you keep going. In the claiming game, you’ve got to keep turning them over.”

Down in the jockeys’ room after Race 5, a jockey hurried in with dirt caking his mouth. A giant electronic sign showed “24,” the number of minutes till the next post. Three jockeys gathered before a TV to re-watch a race few had watched. The ever-demanding scales sat just inside the threshold. A painting on the wall next to it showed a race within the hands of a higher power.



A spectator reflected in a large window at Belmont Park. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post)

Saez, who appeared on national TV for much of 22 minutes last Saturday, a fraught expression upon his handsome face while stewards reviewed tapes, on Sunday morning boarded a charter plane to New York with other jockeys, trainers and owners. That afternoon at Belmont he rode three horses almost anonymously (second, last, last). He rode six more on Thursday (win, sixth, fourth, fourth, fifth, fourth). He declined an interview request.

Velazquez said he had ridden through the spring in “Tampa, Oaklawn [Arkansas], Florida, Louisiana, New York, Kentucky and London.” To manage the grind, he recommended arriving at the track early to allow for 30-minute naps. He said a seasoned jockey feels zero difference between audiences of 150,000 and low triple digits.

“You’ve got to pay attention,” he said several times on the way to this: “You can have an idea what’s going to happen, but eight out of 10 it’s not going to happen the way you think. . . . The horses, anything happens, it’s just when that door opens, you don’t know what to expect until they react for it, and what the other ones are going to do.”

Five days after the Derby, 663 miles away, even after one of the loudest weeks in modern racing history, outside on a patch of grass, set somewhat apart from the small crowd, an excellent duo serving as the day’s musical diversion sang Simon and Garfunkel: “Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike, they’ve all come to look for America.”



Bettors at Belmont Park on Friday. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post)

Kyle Petty's Charity Ride Across America stops in Magee,"MAGEE, Miss (WJTV) - The weather could have been better. Well that actually might be an understatement.

But no amount of rain was going to stop 250 motorcycle riding, charity raising, good hearted people from raising money for a cause they care about.

""I remember Coach Landry used to say ""If you take something out of society, put something back in,"" reminisced long time NFL running back Herschel Walker. “Well this is an opportunity for me to put something back in. Rain, snow, sleet, whatever, this is an opportunity for me to do something for someone else.""

The charity raises money for Victory Junction, a camp the Petty family started in 2004 in honor of the late Adam Petty, for children with serious illnesses.

This is the 25th year of Kyle Petty's Charity Ride Across America. On day 7 of the 9 day trek, they stopped in Magee, Mississippi, where Petty was presented the key to the city for the work he has done for this charity.

Walker, the legendary Georgia running back who played 12 years in the NFL, said after visiting Victory Junction, he knew he had to get more involved with the charity.

""They have volunteer doctors and nurses and all the different volunteers, and when the parents got back, the kids had a smile on their faces,” explained Walker. “The kids saw that they were not alone. That they were not suffering through by themselves, and you know, that makes your heart and makes you feel good, and that's the reason I got involved in this charity.""

This wasn't just a pit stop for the bikers however. Fans came out and waited in severe weather just so they could meet the some of the more well known riders, including the legend himself: Richard Petty.

""I was doing a [radio] thing and I said please, don't put yourself in harm’s way,” said Kyle Petty, referring to the weather. “And people still came out to get my dad's autograph, to get Herschel Walker's [autograph], and to give to kids. And to allow kids to go to camp. [It’s] pretty special, man. It's pretty cool to see all of these people out here.""

The riders will make a couple more stops before they finish their ride in Key Largo, Florida on Saturday.",http://www.wjtv.com/sports/kyle-petty-s-charity-ride-across-america-stops-in-magee/1993229640,2019-05-09T23:06:38Z,WJTV,"5912 US 49, Hattiesburg, MS 39401, USA"
Prolific Tallahassee businessman J.T. Burnette indicted in FBI corruption investigation,"CLOSE Burnette's attorney, Tim Jansen, spoke from outside the federal courthouse. Tallahassee Democrat

John “J.T.” Burnette, a wealthy entrepreneur and the alleged middle man between City Commissioner Scott Maddox and undercover FBI agents, has been indicted by a federal grand jury in connection with the bureau’s long-running public corruption probe, sources close to the investigation said.

Burnette, known for major hotel, restaurant and office projects in Midtown and downtown, is the third person to be charged in the investigation, which began in 2015 with the arrival of the agents.

Who is J.T. Burnette?: Indicted real estate mogul a key player in Tallahassee redevelopment

In December, Maddox and former Downtown Improvement Authority Executive Director Paige Carter-Smith were indicted on federal charges they ran a bribery and extortion ring out of their Governance consulting firm and committed bank fraud in real-estate deals. Their trial is set for early November.

The indictment was not immediately available, but Burnette's Tallahassee defense lawyer Tim Jansen said he faces nine charges, including fraud, extortion and making false statements, all of which he “adamantly denies.”

“I’ve reviewed the indictment and we are going to categorically deny all charges and set the case for trial so he can exonerate himself,” Jansen said outside the U.S. District Courthouse on Adams Street.

Burnette turned himself in at about 11:30 a.m. today at FBI headquarters in Tallahassee. He will have his first appearance before a judgetoday in U.S. District Court in Tallahassee, where grand jurors have been meeting for many months in the corruption probe.

Burnette, 42, and some of his businesses were named in subpoenas served on City Hall in June 2017, when news of the undercover investigation broke. Later, a photograph taken in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2016 surfaced of Burnette posing with Maddox, several undercover agents and a little person entertainer.

The back story:

►44 COUNTS: FBI indicts Scott Maddox and associate Paige Carter-Smith on corruption charges

► A TANGLED WEB: A look at those under the microscope of federal investigators and their connections to the city, businesses and each other.

Federal prosecutors alluded to Burnette in the Maddox indictment, referring to him as a local real estate developer and entrepreneur called Person G, who interfaced with both the commissioner and undercover FBI agents posing as real estate and medical marijuana entrepreneurs.

According to the Maddox indictment, one of the agents spoke with Burnette in July 2016 about Company F, an FBI front company believed to be Southern Pines Development. The company’s purported projects needed sign-off from the City Commission and possible grants from the Community Redevelopment Agency. Burnette told the agents Maddox was the most powerful member of the CRA.

Two months after that meeting, Burnette again met with a representative from the FBI front and others. During the meeting, Burnette allegedly agreed to secure Maddox’s support for a potential project in exchange for a percentage of the deal.

“Person G said that Maddox would be able to support the project by committing official acts such as convincing other commissioners to support the project,” the indictment says. “Person G stated that the amount that Company F would need to pay Maddox through the lobbying firm would increase based on the difficulty of authorizing the project.”

Burnette told the undercover agent that as an example, Company F might need to pay Maddox’s firm $10,000 a month for perhaps as long as three years if the value of the benefit to the company was $3 million.

Not long after that, around Oct. 1, 2016, the Company F representative told Maddox that Burnette recommended he meet with the commissioner. During that conversation, Maddox referred to Burnette as “my guy.”

During subsequent meetings in October 2016, Burnette and an undercover FBI agent agreed that Company F would pay Maddox $10,000 a month. Burnette confirmed the payments were “definitely for Maddox” and that there was “nobody else” at Governance besides Carter-Smith, “which is Maddox, effectively,” Burnette said, according to the indictment.

Burnette went on to say that Maddox “wanted to keep his conversations narrowed to one person” and that he could talk to the commissioner about how he wanted to receive payments through Governance. He said Maddox wanted to limit his “inappropriate conversations” to only one person, Burnette.

Around Oct. 29, 2016, Maddox met with an undercover agent and agreed to perform official acts to benefit Company F. During the meeting, Maddox allegedly directed the agent to send a $10,000 payment to Governance.

In December 2016, Maddox accepted a chartered jet flight to Las Vegas, along with a hotel room and meals, all paid by Company F, according to the indictment. It's believed the hotel room photograph of Maddox, Burnette and the undercover FBI agents was taken during the trip.

That same month, Carter-Smith sent the company a contract in which Governance would provide marketing and government consulting in exchange for $10,000 a month for a year.

"Stark: A remembrance of Phillies chairman David Montgomery,...","The last time I saw David Montgomery, he was doing what he cherished most — sitting beneath the Florida sunshine, in a beautiful ballpark that he helped build, watching his baseball team play, talking about a sport he never stopped loving…

And a sport that never stopped loving him back.

The chairman of the Phillies died Wednesday morning after a five-year battle with cancer, a battle that sapped his strength but none of his never-ending grace. I’ve met hundreds of people in baseball in my time covering this game, but none like David. He lived out a life-long love affair with his sport, but he also did something that would seem impossible — for anyone but him.

He was beloved by all, disliked by no one. I never ran across a single person, in any setting, who wasn’t happy to see him. He spent his entire adult life working in the booing capital of the world — yet he acted like a man who heard only cheers.

So the sadness that swept over baseball Wednesday, following the passing of maybe its most loved and admired citizen, was almost indescribable. Baseball has never had a classier, more dignified, more respected, more upbeat ambassador than this man.

“It’s a sad day,” Bud Selig was saying over the phone Wednesday morning. “I’m just heartsick. Today, we lost — and I lost — a great friend and a wonderful human being who was loved by everyone he knew. So there is real sadness in our game.”

David was never baseball’s most famous executive. But he might have been its most valuable. In his time as commissioner, Selig loved committees, and it felt as though he appointed the president of the Phillies to every one of them. In fact, Selig said Wednesday, with a laugh, “he was usually the first one on there.” Hey, good choice.

You can never go wrong when you bring a man into every room whose only mission is to find that unique way to make everything around him better — and who never wanted any of the glory. So the schedule was a mess? Let’s appoint David. The revenue-sharing formula was a disaster? Let’s appoint David. We need to find a commissioner to succeed Bud? Let’s appoint David.

The result was that David Montgomery was a powerful behind-the-scenes force for labor peace, for baseball’s bold venture into the world of wild cards and expanded playoffs, for its embrace of progress in areas large and small. Yet he never seemed to step in front of a single camera or microphone to reel in the accolades for any of it. None of that mattered. Not to him.

“I can honestly say to you today,” Selig said, “that Dave Montgomery played as important a role, during my 22 years as commissioner, as any human being. He was a guy I never had to talk to about what was in the best interests of the game. He just instinctively did it. There were a couple of times, in the press conference after we announced something, where I’d mention him. And you know what he’d say later? ‘You didn’t have to do that.’”

Right. Of course he did. That was David Montgomery. The smartest man in the room. The classiest man in the room. The humblest man in the room. The nicest man in the room.

How could a man so selfless have been such an effective and inspiring leader? That was a lesson David never stopped teaching.

“You know, there are a lot of different theories about leadership,” baseball’s current commissioner, Rob Manfred, said Wednesday. “But Dave’s view of leadership was that leadership comes from the bottom up. When people think you care about them, they’re more inclined to follow you. And that was Dave Montgomery…

“Dave was also a personal-relationship guy,” Manfred would say. “And not just with those people who worked with him and for him at the Phillies, but across the industry. Even people who worked here in the central office. When he’d come through here, he knew everyone. He never missed a trick.”

Manfred told a story of a night 20 years ago, right after his family had moved to New York, when the Manfred family and the Montgomery family went to the Radio City Christmas show together.

“At the time,” the commissioner said, “my youngest was 6. And that night, she drew Dave a picture at dinner. I know for a fact he carried it in his wallet for years. It might still be in his wallet. But he just had that kind of relationship with everyone he touched. Everyone respected him, and he kept up with people. That’s why you’re seeing this kind of outpouring today.”

Manfred issued a formal statement of condolence Wednesday that included a theme I heard repeatedly as the news of Montgomery’s passing spread and the texts and phone calls began rolling in.

“David’s approach to running the franchise and serving its fans,” the commissioner said in that statement, “was to treat everyone like family.”

Family. Words like that are often spoken casually at times like this — but not in this case.

“David didn’t just care deeply about the Phillies family who worked here,” the Phillies’ director of public affairs, Scott Palmer, said Wednesday. “He knew the names of everyone’s family members and asked about them frequently. Our front office ate lunch together in the media dining room. And David would always seek out the newest person, usually an intern, insist they call him David, and by the end of lunch would know most everything about them.

“He taught us how to be a family,” Palmer said, “and we will now lean on one another as we mourn his passing.”

“I think this sums up David best,” said the Phillies’ director of communications, Greg Casterioto. “A few weeks ago, when he was in the hospital, I called him to see how he was doing. Of course, he wanted no parts of discussing himself. He only had two questions: 1) How my family was doing, mentioning my wife and daughters by name, and 2) how the new players were acclimating into the clubhouse.”

“I didn’t know David for long, about a year and a half,” Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said Wednesday. “But he had a pretty powerful impact on me, as he did with everybody under this roof. In particular, immediately he made me feel like family and made me feel like I was home. And I think he had a unique ability to do that for anybody he came into contact with. I think that’s why today is such a deeply saddening day — because everybody felt like they knew David well, whether they knew him for two months, two years or 20 years.”

I covered David Montgomery for many years when I worked in Philadelphia. But from the day he first introduced himself, during my first spring training, he was never just one of those people you merely “covered.” He wanted to get to know you and your wife and your family and everything about what mattered in your world.

So after my father passed away, of course he was there at the funeral. When my mother died, he was at that funeral, too. Just a couple of years ago, when I was being honored at an event in center city Philadelphia, I can still remember sitting onstage and being blown away at the sight of David Montgomery walking into that room — on a night his team was playing baseball a few miles away, naturally.

But I don’t know why that shocked me. That was David Montgomery.

Then in January, I attended the Philadelphia Sportswriters dinner, where David received a standing ovation — merely for being acknowledged for sitting in the audience that night. That, too, was David Montgomery.

A week later, we met for lunch, where he made sure the conversation centered around everything but himself. Afterward, as we stood up to leave, he said he needed a moment to say hello to a couple of people. Next thing I knew, he’d stopped at almost every table in the room, as people rose to greet him with a hug or a kiss, and he’d asked about their sons, daughters, fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers — all by name. Every one of them. Because that, too, was David Montgomery.

Then, one day in February, I was walking out of Scottsdale Stadium when my phone rang. It was David, wondering when I’d arrive in Florida, because he wanted to set a date — to watch a baseball game with me. So a few weeks later, I kept that date.

As always, people stopped constantly that day to say hello, to shake his hand, to give him a hug, to laugh together, to enjoy another baseball game together. When I asked about his amazing connection with so many people he had bonded with over their mutual love of baseball, he said something that I’ll never forget. It sums up how he went about his job and how he lived his life.

“We’re lucky to work in sports,” he said, looking me right in the eye. “We’re living a dream. We should share that dream.”

That, more than anything, was David Montgomery. All he ever wanted out of a life in baseball was to bring along everyone he met to share the dream. Now it’s our turn to say to him those two words he never needed to hear:

Thank you.

Real Holocaust victim's life 'relived' as millennial on Instagram,"Railway tracks leading to the main gates at Auschwitz II - Birkenau. (Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images)

“It’s 1944, and Nazis have conquered most of Europe … They do terrible things to us Jews … I’m about to turn 13 — finally.”

If that wasn’t a common diary entry for every pre-teen Jewish girl during World War II, it was for Eva Heyman, and the creator of a new Instagram account is determined to show what Eva's life was really like, in a way that her peers now could relate to: through Instagram.

Many of us are familiar with Anne Frank, but Eva was also a real person who endured the tragic life of being a Jew in the 1940s.

She began journaling her life on her 13th birthday, Feb. 13, 1944. She died on Oct. 17, 1944, as one of six million Jews killed at the hands of Nazis in the Holocaust.

An Israeli tech executive, Mati Kochavi, created the Instagram account as an innovative way of getting millennials who are attached to their phones and social media to engage in Holocaust education as the last of the survivors are dying out, according to The New York Times.

Kochavi and his daughter, Maya, created the project that went live on Israel’s annual Holocaust Martyrs’ and Heroes’ Remembrance Day.

In 70 short episodes, Eva, played by a British actress, takes followers with her on her Holocaust journey. And these are based on real entries from a real diary by a real girl.

We witness Eva, through the Instagram posts, go from a happy, imaginative and fun-loving young woman to a scared, lost and hopeless girl.

She talks about her crush and wanting to be a news photographer when she grows up.

Then, as she and her best friend are playing one day, before things get really bad, a man walks past them, spits on the ground and mumbles, ""Dirty Jew.""

""I'm surrounded by war, but I'm always seeing the sun."" -- Eva

As we begin nearing the end of Eva's journey, once the Nazis begin to take over her community, her tone changes drastically.

“You are so lucky that you cannot feel what terrible things are happening to us ... I so much want to live,” she says as she cries.

In her last post, Eva is put on a train to Auschwitz.

The project then ends with a glimpse into the life and death of the real Eva Heyman.

Kochavi's project has received a ton of support, including an endorsement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and plenty of Instagram followers (there were 1.6 million followers of the page as of Tuesday).

""What a great idea. 👏 Thank you for this. I am a teacher in Germany and will bring that to my students,"" one Instagram user said.

And another responded to one of the posts, ""I think this is great idea to ensure also the younger generations remembers the holocaust!!!""

But the project has not come without criticism.

Some Israelis say the use of “selfie culture” and the use of hashtags and emojis to try to simulate life during the Holocaust is cheapening and trivializing that period of history.

Regardless, Kochavi said he spent several million dollars on the project because the Holocaust needs attention from today's youth.

“The memory of the Holocaust outside of Israel is disappearing,” Kochavi said in an interview with The New York Times. “We thought, 'Let’s do something really disruptive.' We found the journal and said, ‘Let’s assume that instead of pen and paper, Eva had a smartphone and documented what was happening to her.’ So we brought a smartphone to 1944.”

After searching through about 30 young people's journals from the Holocaust, Kochavi and his daughter chose to tell Eva's story because of something very ""modern and relatable"" to her.

""I have no doubt in my mind that young people around the world want to have serious content and be connected in the right way,” he said.

Documents detail 'severe injuries' in abuse of toddler,"The mother of a 2-year-old girl noticed injuries to her child every time she left her alone with her live-in boyfriend.

Leon County Sheriff’s Office investigators were made aware Monday of a possible child abuse incident when the girl was transported to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare with severe injuries.

Her brain was bleeding in two places. She had liver lacerations. Both her ears were bruised. She had cuts and abrasions on her hip, face and arms.

The girl’s mother, 26-year-old Heather Reid, was arrested after being questioned by detectives. She faces charges child neglect and neglect with great bodily harm.

She told detectives she heard a thud come from the other room and believed the girl had fallen out of bed. After answering that only she and another man were at the house, she backtracked and said that her boyfriend, Clayton Pafford, was also home.

She said Monday was not the first time she noticed the child with injuries.

“She noticed every time she leaves (her) alone with Clayton, she would return home and discover more injuries,” according to court records.

Reid said she didn't report previous injuries she believed were connected with Pafford because she was worried the toddler would be taken by the Florida Department of Children and Families.

The friend told LCSO he heard the same thud but that Reid wasn’t at the Crossway Court house when it happened. He saw Pafford, 23, come out of a bedroom with the toddler’s, bloody limp body. Pafford began calling Reid instead of for medical help.

The friend called 911 as Pafford left the home saying, “Don’t tell anyone I was here.”

Pafford, 23, was arrested Tuesday after leading law enforcement officials on a chase through Woodville. He faces charges of child neglect, aggravated battery on a child, kidnapping, hitting a police dog, kidnapping, aggravated assault of a police officer and multiple other charges stemming from fleeing officers.

LCSO deputies, along with members of the U.S. Marshals Violent Fugitive Task Force and the Florida Highway Patrol, searched for Pafford all night. He was finally located at about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday driving on Back Forest Road by a member of LCSO’s Special Projects Investigations Detection Enforcement Response Unit and members of the Florida Highway Patrol. When they tried to stop him, Pafford refused to stop and fled.

Persuing deputies and troopers used stop sticks in the southbound travel lane of Old Woodville Highway, but Pafford swerved toward the deputy onto the St. Marks bike trail, narrowly missing him. Pafford turned back onto Old Woodville Highway and crossed over Bob Miller Road before troopers were able to stop his vehicle, LCSO reported.

Pafford, who had a passenger in his vehicle, refused to surrender. A LCSO K9 was used to take him into custody and after being treated at a local hospital was taken to the Leon County Detention Facility.

The couple was investigated by DCF last month when hospital staff noticed the toddler’s injuries.

In mid-April, staff at Capital Regional Medical Center noticed the girl was dirty, was covered in bug bites, had a bruise under her left eye and a bald spot on her head. The girl had a burn on her right hand and lesions on her body. Staff members overheard Reid making alarming statements about not being about to take care of the girl and not caring if she was eating.

"Lonely 6-year-old's 911 call becomes teachable moment, bond with Tallahassee police officer","A 911 call from a lonely 6-year-old boy could have ended with stern discipline instead of a stuffed animal and perhaps a budding friendship.

The boy, who's name hasn't been released, said his mom was ""mean"" and made him cry, according to the 911 call. The dispatcher stayed on the line and asked him several questions, including his age, address and where were his parents, who were unaware their son called 911.

Tallahassee Police Officer Joe White was en route when the boy called a few more times to make sure an officer was coming. Once he arrived, the boy asked if he and White could be friends.

The Tallahassee Police Department posted on Facebook pictures of White and the boy holding a stuffed animal given by White. The officer informed the boy of when to use 911.

TPD spokesman Damon Miller told the Tallahassee Democrat the social media post was made by another public information officer so he couldn't confirm whether White made contact with the boy's parents before the post was made public.

Steve Harrelson, director of the Consolidated Dispatch Agency, said it's rare that a child calls 911 because they're lonely.

Here’s Officer Joe White's his new friend, who called 911 because he was lonely. (Photo: Tallahassee Police Department)

""Realizing he was a child, we put some extra attention to that,"" said Harrelson, who urged parents to teach their children about 911. ""It was a great conclusion to an incident that could have been a lot worse. (White) used that moment to educate the uses of 911 ... It worked all the way around for everyone.""

Miller said White did what most officers do every day, but most people don't know about. He said it's not unusual for officers to have similar encounters with children.

""He let the young man know that they can be his friend and how to use the 911,"" Miller said. ""This is a classic example that we are humans as well, and we are not robots.""

Pafford, who had a passenger in his vehicle, refused to surrender. A LCSO K9 was used to take him into custody and after being treated at a local hospital was taken to the Leon County Detention Facility.

The couple was investigated by DCF last month when hospital staff noticed the toddler’s injuries.

In mid-April, staff at Capital Regional Medical Center noticed the girl was dirty, was covered in bug bites, had a bruise under her left eye and a bald spot on her head. The girl had a burn on her right hand and lesions on her body. Staff members overheard Reid making alarming statements about not being about to take care of the girl or if she was eating.

Vietnam War mural pits residents vs. Florida community. Matter settled ... unhappily,"CLOSE The wreath placement and opening ceremony for the Vietnam and All Veterans Reunion at Wickham Park, Melbourne. Tim Shortt, FLORIDA TODAY

A skirmish between residents and management at a North Fort Myers development in Florida involving a memorial to the Vietnam War ended peacefully if not unhappily Tuesday.

The issue arose seemingly overnight when residents of the Del Tura Golf & Country Club began talking on social media sites about a mural on a garage door painted in black and depicting a Vietnam War-era soldier kneeling before a cross with a helicopter flying in the background.

Community officials sent Bob Masson, 71, a Vietnam War vet and the mural's owner, a letter asking him to remove the depiction. Apparently there also had been a complaint.

""It feels like I've been kicked in the head,"" Masson said. ""It feels like (his service in the war) meant nothing right now. It meant a lot to us when we were over there.""

Tuesday morning a group of residents gathered at the Del Tura clubhouse parking lot and started discussing the issue, which they said they thought was all about the military content of the mural.

Del Tura is a 55-and-over manufactured homes community on U.S. 41 in North Fort Myers.

""There's a lot of military veterans in here,"" Don Beavers, 60 and a veteran, said. ""It was on NextDoor and it just blew up yesterday. Everyone got involved last night.""

NextDoor is a social media site that developments such as Del Tura, gated communities and local communities can join to find out goings-on for their specific areas.

Richard Dzedzej, a resident at Del Tura, said the homeowner is a Vietnam veteran and was going to comply with the letter he received and paint over the picture.

""Other veterans told him that there is nothing wrong with it and to leave it intact,"" Dzedzej said.

Eventually Fred Taylor, the community manager, came out and addressed the residents.

""I'm happy to answer questions,"" Taylor told them. ""But not with the news present.""

Taylor told the group before moving inside the clubhouse that he was unaware they would be coming to meet with him with the news media present.

When questioned about the letter Taylor said Masson had not sought the proper approval despite community rules that disallow any mural on a garage door.

""I explained it is not the content of the graphic,"" Taylor said before asking the residents to meet with him in private. ""It is any graphic.""

Taylor pointed out that the community flies a POW flag on its main flagpole.

After the meeting the residents said they were satisfied but some were still a bit rankled that it was handled the way it was.

""I consider it unhappily settled,"" Dzedzej said. ""I understand the point but do think they could have let him keep it.""

Dzedzej's son Mike doesn't live at Del Tura but was visiting with his veteran dad and wasn't happy either.

""I think it's nonsense that he has to take it down,"" he said.

Masson, who has a flagpole with the POW and U.S. flags flying, and statues of military figures on his front lawn in basically the same configuration as the mural, said he put up the mural three months ago.

""I'm a military man all the way,"" Masson said. ""I'm just appalled that I have to take this off. It took them three months to send me the letter. But I see their point, they have a job to do.""

He said he was told he could keep the mural until Memorial Day and then replace it with a flag of the same topic or a plexiglass depiction and place it alongside the house. He said the brief battle won't prompt him to move.

""I have a lot of good friends, veterans, behind me 100 percent. I'm very disappointed,"" he said. ""But I'll get over it. ... I'll bite the bullet.""

""It's a beautiful thing,"" said Victor DiGrazia, 90, an Army veteran who saw action in the Korean War. ""I'll fight for this country till the day I die but the management is right. We have 1,300 residents here. What if someone wanted to put up a picture of a motorcycle?""

Take the time to listen: This World War II veteran has stories to share

After the meeting broke up Taylor declined to comment and referred questions to corporate offices of Hometown America Communities Corporation, owner of Del Tura and other communities in 12 states.

Attempts to reach company president and spokesman Stephen Braun were unsuccessful.

"Gulfshore Playhouse in Naples ends season with play ""Skylight""","CLOSE Amy Blackman and Todd Weeks rehearse Skylight at Gulfshore Playhouse Morgan Hornsby, morgan.hornsby@naplesnews.com

Ever wonder what it would be like to run into your ex? That dream or nightmare, depending on how it all went down, is played out in ""Skylight"" as two former lovers rehash and recriminate three years after their torrid love affair.

All the while drinks are poured, a table is set and dinner is served in the more than two-hour Gulfshore Playhouse production, the last one of the 2018-19 season.

More: Review: Gulfshore Playhouse Holmes thriller full of twists, humor

The Tony Award–winning play, written by British dramatist David Hare, is playing at the local theater until May 19. ""Skylight,"" which first premiered more than 20 years ago, has been revived a handful of times, most recently in 2015 at the Golden Theater in New York City starring actors Bill Nighy and Carey Mulligan.

Todd Weeks and Amy Blackman rehearse Skylight at Gulfshore Playhouse in Naples on Tuesday, April 30, 2019. (Photo: Morgan Hornsby/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

At first glance, ""Skylight"" seems like a simple play. There are only three characters, two of which are alone onstage for most of the play, which takes place in a modest London flat.

The complexity lies in the main characters and their history. Memories are all Kyra Hollis (played by Amy Blackman) and Tom Sergeant (Todd Weeks) seem to have left in ""Skylight."" They ruminate, debate and butt heads as they unpack their six-year affair when Tom pays Kyra a surprise visit one cold winter night three years after the fact.

Today, he's a self-made entrepreneur, who recently lost his wife and the business he spent decades building. She's a young schoolteacher, who said goodbye to her privileged past to join the working class. At first, it seems as though the two have nothing in common, except for their past, but, as cliché as it sounds, opposites attract.

She's around 30 years old and Tom is nearly 50. He wears a handsome, expensive suit, she a simple sweater and jeans. He has a driver and she takes the bus. Their differences are obvious, especially when Tom continuously interjects his disapproval of her humble flat with a heater that doesn't heat. But the attraction is still there — in their eyes, in their body language.

But this reunion isn't necessarily a happy one.

The former lovers debate everything from politics and economics to, of course, their past. All the while, Kyra is cooking spaghetti over a real stove — making things even saucier. Blackman is gifted in the art of multi-tasking. She chops onions and spills dry spaghetti into a boiling pot without missing a beat. Weeks is stellar at playing a seemingly self-assured man, who is really just a man with a broken heart.

Six years of their closeted, extramarital affair is unpacked onstage. How they met: Tom was a hotel and restaurant entrepreneur on the rise. Kyra answered a “waitress wanted” ad at one of his restaurants where they met and somehow she became a part of the family unit with Tom’s wife Alice and their young son Edward.

And how it ended: Alice discovered love letters Kyra wrote to Tom causing Kyra to flee. Alice subsequently died of cancer leaving both Tom and his teenage son (played by Evan Sibley) to fend for themselves.

""Skylight"" is all about language, not so much action, though there is some utensil-throwing. The tension between the two characters is palpable as they move about the kitchen and living area like two boxers sizing each other up before a fight.

Though they are essentially strangers to one another, you can't help but root for them and hope they can find some common ground.

Milton man sentenced to 17 years for sex trafficking,"BOSTON – A 31-year-old Milton man has been sent to federal prison for 17 years for sex trafficking women on the defunct Backpage.com and other websites.

Duhamel Cassagnol pleaded guilty to working with a 24-year-old Connecticut woman, Geneiva Whaley, to prostitute at least four victims from July 2014 to February 2016. They housed the victims in hotel rooms reserved in Whaley’s name in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and Florida. Prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office said the women had little or no control over what acts they were required to engage in or what fee would be charged. Cassagnol or Whaley collected the money, leaving the victims dependent on them for food and shelter.

Prosecutors said the victims were addicted to heroin and other drugs that they were given only if they made money on sex acts. Cassagnol threatened all four women and beat at least three of them. At least once he forced one of the women to use drugs against her will.

U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs sentenced Cassagnol on Tuesday to 17 years and three months in prison, five years of supervised release. She also ordered him to pay his victims $13,000.

Cassagnol and Whaley were arrested in December 2017. Whaley pleaded guilty to transporting a person for prostitution and was sentenced to a year in prison and five years of supervised release.

Off The Beat: Fort Pierce man learns dangers of wearing sibling’s pants,"FORT PIERCE — There can be dangers associated with wearing your brother’s pants.

Jeffery Junior Davis (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY FORT PIERCE POLICE)

Jeffery Junior Davis, 59, of Fort Pierce appears to have learned that the hard way, according to an arrest affidavit.

The April 19 case began about 8:17 p.m. when Fort Pierce police say a Ford Explorer didn’t come to a complete stop at North 24th Street and Avenue E.

More: Beer ‘brewhaha’ doesn’t skunk investigators

Police stopped the Ford and spoke to the driver, identified as Davis.

Davis told investigators he didn’t have a license.

He further said the tag on the Ford didn’t belong to it, and that he put it on so he could drive to the store.

In light of the alleged license and tag infractions, it could be said Davis was caught with his pants down.

More:Man says he's 'too fat' for DUI test

Police searched Davis and reported finding a small amount of crack cocaine in a pocket of his pants, a garment that covers the body from the waist to the ankles.

“Man, these are my brother’s pants,” Davis is quoted as exclaiming.

Davis likely needed this encounter with police like a kick in the pants because he was arrested on charges of cocaine possession and driving while license suspended.

Teen suspect in deadly Palm Coast shooting to be tried as adult,"PALM COAST, Fla. - A 17-year-old indicted on a first-degree murder charge in the death of a Palm Coast high school senior will be tried as an adult, the State Attorney’s Office has decided.

“It is a somber reality of our job that sometimes requires the charging of juveniles in adult court -- but some acts are so violent and have such little regard for the value of human life that the perpetrator has to be held accountable with adult consequences,” State Attorney R.J. Larizza said.

Marion Lee Gavins Jr. was indicted Friday in the shooting death of 18-year-old Curtis Gray in April.

Gray was shot just after midnight April 13 in the parking lot of a strip mall on Belle Terre Parkway in Palm Coast, according to deputies. Gray died at a hospital, and deputies arrested Gavins the next day when he turned himself in.

Sheriff Rick Staly said he fully supports Larizza’s decision.

“Sadly, this is a young man who exhibited increasingly violent behavior that ultimately caused another teenager’s death,” Staly said. “Being tried as an adult is the most appropriate way to prosecute this crime.”

Flagler court records show Gavins was previously arrested on charges of:

Selling marijuana near a school at 13 years old, in 2014

Violation of probation and possession of a weapon -- an 8-inch kitchen knife -- in 2015

Domestic violence toward his mother, in 2016

Violation of home detention, in 2016

Gavins, who is currently being held by the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office at the Duval County Jail, will be returned to Flagler County when he turns 18 on May 16.

Jacksonville man injured after deer collides with motorcycle,"PRATT COUNTY, Kan. - A Jacksonville man suffered multiple injuries after a deer collided with his motorcycle last month.

Tim Roush, 56, of Jacksonville, was in Kansas April 28 when a deer jumped out from the side of the road and hit the front wheel on the left side, Pratt Tribune reports.

A GoFundMe account set up for Roush said he underwent surgery after MRI results revealed he had three crushed vertebrae in his neck.

He also has a broken leg, broken ribs and has pain in his arms and issues lifting them.

Roush was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident.

Roush and his wife are still in Kansas, with Tim in the ICU, but are trying to get back home to Jacksonville. Friends of the family reached out to News4Jax about the accident.

""The problem that is against them is that the insurance company is only going to pay for Tim to be transported to the nearest facility in Lincoln, NB and will not cover for Tim to come home to Jacksonville to our Spinal Rehab Facility where Tim and Sabrina would be surrounded by family and friends who could help support them.""

"Man accused of beating woman with conch shell, throwing her into canal","Calvin Joseph Teal, 38, is accused of beating a woman in the head with a conch shell and throwing her into a canal on Big Coppitt Key.

BIG COPPITT KEY, Fla. - A Big Coppitt Key man was arrested Sunday afternoon after he beat up a woman and threw her into a canal, authorities said.

According to Monroe County Sheriff's Office spokesman Adam Linhardt, a deputy arrived to 9 Riviera Drive around 1 p.m. to find the 44-year-old victim bleeding profusely from the head and with multiple bruises throughout her body.

Linhardt said the woman told the deputy that Calvin Joseph Teal, 38, beat her, threw her down onto the floor and then threw her into the canal.

A neighbor told the deputy that Teal was asleep inside the home.

The deputy went inside the home and saw blood on the floor, ""a large amount of bloody paper towels in the kitchen trash can and a blood trail leading down a hallway to a bedroom where Teal was sleeping,"" Linhardt said.

Authorities said the victim was taken to the Lower Keys Medical Center on Stock Island, where she told a second deputy that Teal had hit her in the head with a conch shell before he threw her into the canal.

Teal was arrested. Authorities said they found a bottle of 34 Xanax pills that he didn't have a prescription for while he was being booked into jail. Teal faces charges of aggravated battery, possession of Xanax without a prescription and smuggling contraband (Xanax) into a detention facility.

A motive for the attack is unclear.

Gary Wayne Anderson, 68, was arrested on charges of driving under the influence after crashing his lawn mower into a Haines City Police Department vehicle around 7 p.m. Saturday

According to Haines City police, the cruiser was parked at Rodriguez Fashion at 1100 U.S. 17-92 while the officer was tending to another matter. The officer heard a loud noise and saw Anderson on a riding mower pulling an attached trailer, police said.

There was minor damage to the rear plastic portion of the police vehicle's bumper, officials said.

Anderson told police that he hit the vehicle, but didn't cause any damage and that he was drunk, according to authorities.

Anderson was unable to complete field sobriety tests and claimed that he had been poisoned by police and asked to be taken to a hospital, officials said. Anderson was taken to Heart of Florida Regional Medical Center, police said.

Anderson's blood alcohol content was more than three times the legal limit of 0.08, said police, who added that there was also cocaine in his system.

""I'm proud of the professional demeanor our officers showed when dealing with this heavily intoxicated, belligerent offender,"" Police Chief Jim Elensky said. ""It's never a good idea to get behind the wheel drunk, even if that wheel is to a Craftsman, Massey Ferguson or John Deere.""

Man arrested in connection with stabbing behind Hialeah strip mall,"Juan Pablo Velasco, 24, is accused of stabbing a man May 4 in Hialeah.

HIALEAH, Fla. - A 24-year-old man was arrested Sunday in connection with a stabbing that occurred Saturday night behind a strip mall in Hialeah.

Hialeah Fire Rescue crews said they received calls for help at a strip mall along the 600 block of East Ninth Street shortly before 6 p.m. Saturday.

According to an arrest report, surveillance video shows Juan Pablo Velasco, who is homeless, stabbing the victim in the neck, chest and back.

Witnesses told Local 10 News reporter Sanela Sabovic that the victim somehow made his way out of the parking lot and through a gangway and reached a restaurant counter, where he asked for help. His shirt was covered in blood, and he was there for a few minutes, pacing. At one point, he was banging on the counter for help.

Hialeah police said the victim, who is in his 20s, was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where he underwent surgery for his life-threatening injuries.

According to an arrest report, an officer recognized Velasco from the surveillance video. Police said the victim also identified Velasco as his attacker in a photo and said that he knows him from the area.

A motive for the stabbing is unclear.

Velasco was taken into custody early Sunday for a separate case in which he faces charges of resisting arrest without violence and burglary. He now also faces a charge of attempted second-degree murder.

"South Florida man stabs sleeping mother several times, deputies say","Ryan Guenot, 30, is accused of stabbing his mother several times while she was sleeping.

ROYAL PALM BEACH, Fla. - A South Florida man was arrested Friday after he attacked his sleeping mother, stabbing her several times, deputies said.

Ryan Guenot, 30, of Royal Palm Beach, faces a charge of attempted first-degree murder.

According to a Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office probable cause affidavit, Guenot's half-brother, Javier Gallardo, called 911 Friday morning and said his brother ""had cut his mother with a knife and left the residence.""

When deputies arrived, they found a large blood trail leading into the home and blood smears on a wall.

Gallardo told detectives he was sleeping in his room when he heard his mother screaming about 6 a.m. Gallardo said he pulled Guenot off her and put him in a headlock before Guenot broke free and ran out of the house.

Tina Guenot, 57, told detectives her son came home from SunFest about 3 a.m. She went back to sleep but woke up a few hours later ""to what felt like punches to her head.""

Detectives said Tina Guenot had a cut to the back of her head, three stab wounds to her face, two stab wounds to her chest and one cut across her neck.

""The tip of a knife was also discovered to be broken off inside Tina's head as a result of being stabbed,"" the affidavit said.

Ryan Guenot was later spotted along Okeechobee Boulevard and taken into custody. Detectives said he asked how his mother was doing.

During a recorded confession, Ryan Guenot said he came home and saw his mother sleeping in the living room. He said he went to sleep in his room but woke up at some point after falling asleep.

""Ryan initially said he did not recall any details but knew that he attacked his mother,"" the affidavit said. ""Ryan later added he woke up and vaguely remembered grabbing a knife from the kitchen drawer.""

According to the affidavit, Ryan Guenot went on to say that ""he proceeded to attack Tina with the goal of killing her. Ryan told me something in his head told him to kill his mom.""

Ryan Guenot was being held without bond at the main Palm Beach County jail.

Sheriff's spokeswoman Teri Barbera said Tina Guenot was in critical condition Friday at an area hospital.

PORT RICHEY, Fla. (WFLA) - A Pasco County father is facing an aggravated assault charge after deputies explained that he pointed a gun at a person for allegedly driving dangerously around his daughter's school bus.

Deputies arrested 43-year-old Daniel Carroll on Tuesday in Port Richey.

According to an arrest report, Carroll followed the victim to his home Tuesday morning then got out of his car and started yelling at the man. Deputies say Carroll yelled that the victim was putting his daughter in danger.

""Apparently, he made a turn in front of the school bus while it was stopped and he thought that was maybe too dangerous,"" said sheriff's spokesman Kevin Doll.

The victim said Carroll told him he was not going to ""get away with this,"" the arrest report says. Carroll is accused of then pulling a gun out and pointing it at the victim before getting back in his car and driving away.

Deputies later met up with Carroll, who told them he was upset because several people had been speeding past his daughter's bus stop. The arrest report says Carroll admitted to following the victim to his home to tell him not to speed past the stop.

Carroll told deputies the victim balled his fists and charged at him aggressively, the arrest report says. Deputies say the dad told them he pulled his gun out and backed away as the victim yelled to shoot him.

The arrest report says Carroll admitted what he did was wrong. He was arrested for aggravated assault.

""I've seen people chase down people around school buses and yell at them and argue with them, but never follow them to their house to pull out a weapon and threaten them that way,"" Doll said Wednesday.

A judge set Carroll's bond at $10,000.",http://www.wfla.com/news/pasco-county/deputies-dad-upset-about-dangerous-bus-stop-arrested-for-pointing-gun-at-driver-in-pasco/1988892946,2019-05-08T20:18:25Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"
Deputy revived by Narcan after exposure to fentanyl,"CLERMONT — Authorities said a Florida sheriff's deputy was revived with Narcan after he was apparently exposed to fentanyl during a traffic stop.

Lake County Sheriff's Sgt. Fred Jones told news outlets that the deputy saw drugs in the vehicle as he was pulling out a suspect. That's when the deputy was overcome by the drug and passed out.

Jones said another deputy injected the deputy with Narcan, which helps reverse an opioid overdose. He regained consciousness, but then two arriving firefighters began feeling ill.

Jones said one of the firefighters also was given Narcan.

He said the deputy, two firefighters and a man who had been in the car were all taken to a hospital. They're all expected to be OK.

Man injured by fishing line strung across bicycle path.,"Man injured by fishing line strung across bicycle path. Video

ORMOND BEACH, Fla. (WESH) - A Sunday bike ride through an Ormond Beach, Florida park was anything but pleasant for a woman and her boyfriend.

He said he rode right into a fishing line, tied off between a dock and a tree, that was at neck height.

The man said he had to fall off his bike to avoid a possible life-threatening injury.

""I'm lucky to walk away. It's just scary to think that something like that is out here,"" the man said.

""He could have gone right through it, and it could have taken his head off in all reality,"" his girlfriend added.

""It was burning, like somebody was like, taking fishing wire or something like that trying to decapitate me the whole time,"" he said.

The man and his girlfriend asked not to be identified since they ride bikes in Central Park almost daily, and fear reprisal for sounding the alarm.

Woman creates bulletproof hoodies for all ages due to widespread shootings,"EAST PALO ALTO, Calif. - A woman whose neighbor was shot and killed in an attempted robbery has started a company that makes bulletproof hoodies to keep people of all ages safe.

The California company, Wonder Hoodie, produces the bulletproof protection in smaller sizes for young children and teens after the rash of school shootings in the U.S.

Vy Tran, 25, says she came up with the idea after her neighbor was killed in front of their home and she couldn't find protective gear for her mother or brother.

Wonder Hoodie products meet the requirements for body armor by the National Institute of Justice. The company also sells bulletproof jean jackets, vests and other accessories, reports KTRK.

All of the company's bulletproof products can protect people from weapons such as a .44 magnum.

""We only use dupont kevlar and a newer version of their kevlar, called kevlar xp,"" said Tran. ""They're rated as 3A, which is the highest level of protection you can get from soft body armor.""

Tran says one man bought a hoodie for his wife, who is a teacher. Another customer bought one to feel safe to go to the movies.

Murder suspect with ties to Naples Park representing himself as trial begins in Sarasota,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Collier County on naplesnews.com. Wochit

The suspect accused of killing a man and dumping his carpet-wrapped body at a Naples Park home in October spoke calmly as he represented himself at a Sarasota County courthouse Tuesday morning.

Daniel Davenport, 31, of Sarasota, faces a second-degree murder charge related to the killing of Sergio Hostins, 55, of Sarasota.

He also faces charges of grand theft of a motor vehicle, 10 counts of fraudulent use of personal identification information and unlawful possession of four or fewer identities.

Davenport was arrested in Orlando in October 2018 after eluding authorities for more than a week. He was booked at the Orange County Jail in Orlando and extradited to Sarasota County, where he has been held without bond.

Davenport wore a gray suit with a red tie and was required to stay within the boundaries of black duct tape on the carpet of Courtroom 4A when talking to the jury or questioning witnesses during the trial.

In early April, a judge approved Davenport’s motion to represent himself.

Assistant Public Defender Gino Lombardi sat next to Davenport during the trial Tuesday as his stand-by counsel.

Davenport would be allowed to ask Lombardi questions only about court procedures if he wanted to continue representing himself, 12th Judicial Circuit Court Judge Stephen Walker told him before jurors entered the courtroom Tuesday.

Previously: Tracing a crime: Sarasota man slain; body found in Naples Park; suspect arrested in Orlando

Davenport’s opening statement was filled with objections from assistant state attorneys prosecuting the case. It started when Davenport asked jurors to take their duties serious because “a man's life depends on it.”

After Walker sided with the prosecutors, Davenport and asked the jurors to keep open minds during the trial. He referred to himself as the defendant and Hostins as the “alleged victim.”

""The defendant is being accused of taking a man's (Hostins’) life for his credit cards,” Davenport said.

He is a business man, a home owner and the idea that he would take a man’s life for his credit cards doesn’t make any sense, Davenport said.

Assistant State Attorney Kennedy Brandon Legler told the jurors he wouldn’t be able to tell them exactly why, where or when Hostins was murdered.

""What I will tell you and what will be crystal clear at the end of this trial is that (Hostins) died literally at the hands of the defendant Daniel Davenport,” Legler said.

Hostins was strangled, stripped, then wrapped in a comforter, trash bags, insulation, more carpet and which was duct-taped shut before he was stuffed in the back of his car and driven around for a few days. He was then dumped at a home in Naples to bake in the hot sun, Legler said.

“That is what this man, Daniel Davenport, did to Sergio Hostins in October of 2018 when he threw him away like a piece of trash,” Legler said during his statement.

The timeline of the days following and leading up to Hostins’ death would prove Davenport's guilt, Legler told the jurors.

In September of 2018, Hostins and Davenport first met and began chatting on a social media app for gay men, called Grindr.

They developed a casual dating relationship, Legler told the jurors.

Evidence would show a neighbor heard a verbal confrontation she thought was coming from Hostins’ apartment the day before Hostins failed to show up for work as a waiter at an Italian restaurant on Oct. 3, Legler said during his opening statement.

From around that date until Davenport’s arrest on Oct. 19, 2018, Davenport was spotted multiple times driving Hostins’ car and using Hostins’ debit and credit cards throughout Florida, Legler said.

Hostins loved his green Subaru Forester and everyone knew the distinct vehicle belonged to him, Legler said.

Davenport asked his brother-in-law, a commercial fisherman, how far he would need to go out to get rid of something and said he needed to dispose of a body on Oct. 7, Legler told the jurors.

A man, who hired Davenport for tree removal services at homes in Cape Coral and Naples, took notice of a rolled-up carpet in the back of the green Subaru Forester Davenport was driving later that same day, Legler said.

Evidence in the trial would show that Hostins’ body was found the morning of Oct. 9, by contractors who came to work on renovating a home, Legler said.

This home was in in the 700 block of 102nd Avenue North in Naples Park and was the same home from which Davenport was hired to remove trees, the prosecutor said.

Fingerprints on trash bags and pieces of insulation that wrapped Hostins’ body matched Davenport’s, Legler told the jury.

Davenport was connected to a home in the 200 block of Pelican Road in Venice. Evidence would show the same types of insulation, trash bags, duct tape and carpeting used to wrap Hostins’ body were found in the home, Legler said.

During his opening statement, Davenport admitted to having a romantic relationship with Hostins.

“The evidence will show you that like most romantic relationships the alleged victim would let the defendant use his credit cards as well as loan him his car periodically,” Davenport said.

Davenport said he also has evidence that he was not at Hostins’ apartment on Oct. 2 when the neighbor thought she heard a verbal confrontation.

Text message records prove that Davenport was with his wife at a poker tournament that night, Davenport said.

“I’m confident that the evidence will prove I’m innocent,” Davenport said. “There is no doubt in my mind everyone here will agree.""

The trial was at the Judge Lynn N. Silvertooth Judicial Center in Sarasota and began Monday with jury selection. It is expected to last six or seven business days, said Assistant State Attorney Karen Fraivillig.

"Florida woman pulls alligator from yoga pants during traffic stop, police say","PUNTA GORDA, Fla. - A Florida woman pulled an alligator out of her yoga pants after being pulled over with a man in a pickup truck early Monday morning, according to police.

Deputies pulled over the truck about 3:15 a.m. after it drove past a stop sign, according to an incident report obtained by WBBH. The 22-year-old male driver told deputies that he and the woman, 25, were coming from an underpass where they were trying to collect frogs and snakes, the report said.

The driver was given a warning for the stop-sign violation before deputies asked to see what wildlife he and the woman had collected to make sure they didn't have anything they weren't supposed to. The woman opened a backpack at her feet to reveal 43 small turtles, police said.

When asked if she had anything else on her, the woman reportedly pulled a foot-long alligator out of her yoga pants.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission was later called to the scene. Due to Florida's wildlife regulations, the reptiles were seized and released.

""Not to be outdone by the #FloridaMan, a #FloridaWoman pulled this alligator out of her pants Monday morning,"" the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office wrote in a Facebook post.

Florida Woman Pulls Foot-Long Alligator From Her Yoga Pants During Traffic Stop,"I’m going to miss Florida when it’s buried under surging seawaters in just a few short years, specifically for stories like this: A woman pulled a foot-long alligator out of her yoga pants during a traffic stop.



Before we get to my many logistical questions, here are the facts: NBC reports that deputies pulled over the pickup truck, in which the woman was a passenger, around 3:15 a.m. in Punta Gorda after seeing it blow a stop sign. After stopping, the driver, a 22-year-old man, told authorities that he and the woman were coming from a nearby underpass, where they were trying to collect frogs and snakes, as one does.

The deputies issued the man a warning for the stop sign incident, then asked to see their spoils, on the off chance that their perfectly normal outing resulted in gathering some wildlife they shouldn’t have:

The driver opened the bags near him, which contained clothes and personal items. The 25-year-old female passenger then opened the backpack at her feet, revealing 42 small three-striped mud turtles and one softshell turtle. When Charlotte County deputies asked her if she had anything else on her person the deputies needed to know about, she pulled a foot-long alligator out of her yoga pants and placed it in the truck bed, according to the report.

Donuts in the front yard?

That's what an Orange County man said a woman did over the weekend at his mega-mansion.

The man said the woman made anti-Semitic comments while tearing up his yard.

The homeowner, Jeff Gelman, said he has never seen the woman before.

The home, near Windermere, is called the most expensive home in Central Florida, and is on the market for $28 million.

Kristen Kelly, 45, of Winter Garden, is accused of driving a Dodge SUV, doing donuts in the yard, and yelling anti-Semitic insults.

""Yelling out her window, 'Jews get out of here. Jews are dirty,'"" Gelman said.

Gelman showed WESH 2 News around the house. He said on Saturday afternoon, the woman's SUV somehow got through his gates and on to his property.

""I look outside and there was a car, driving through our yard, doing donuts,"" Gelman said.

Gelman said he and his wife ran outside. He said the driver started chasing them with the SUV.

Gelman also took pictures of the woman he said was driving the vehicle.

""Never. I've never seen this woman. It's unbelievable,"" he said.

Gelman said the woman got out of the SUV with a bottle.

""She came out with some cleaner, started spraying us, saying she was going to clean the Jews,"" he said.

The Orange County Sheriff's Office said Kelly was captured a few blocks away, and now, she is charged with aggravated assault and burglary.

Fishing line tied across bike path in Ormond Beach slices man's throat,"ORMOND BEACH, Fla. - A couple riding bikes in Central Park in Ormond Beach said a fishing line was tied across the path and sliced the man's throat.



""I thought it was a spider web. It was literally burning,"" he said. For what it was, I'm lucky to walk away.""



The couple declined to reveal their identity in fear of retaliation but they showed News 6 pictures of what the man's throat looked like yesterday and where they found the line, tied from a fishing dock to a tree at the Joyce Ebbins Fishing Pier and Observation Deck.



""He literally could have been decapitated. If we were going faster like we normally do and it wasn't raining,"" said the woman. ""There's no way this could have been somebody's fishing line that got hung up on the dock and they just walked with it because it would be laying on the ground. It was strung up around neck height on purpose.""



The couple notified Ormond Beach police who are now investigating the incident.

The woman said it hasn't stopped them from riding their bikes on Monday, but said they'll be extra careful and warns others to be as well.



""If you're out here just be vigilant and keep your eyes out. You don't know what's out there,"" she said.

Pasco man shot when wife drops purse in Publix checkout,"LAND O LAKES, Fla. (WFLA) - A man was accidentally shot by his wife at a Land O' Lakes Publix on Sunday, according to the Pasco County Sheriff's Office.

It happened at the Publix located in the 2100 block of Collier Parkway.

Deputies say the man's wife was at the cash register, checking out. The wife's purse was on the counter and fell to the ground.

Through the investigation, it appears that the wife carried a Derringer 2-shotgun in her purse which fired when the purse fell to the ground and a bullet struck the man's lower right shin.

The man was transported to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries and is in stable condition. At this time no criminal charges are expected.

Florida man on lawnmower arrested for DUI after crashing into police cruiser,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

HAINES CITY, Fla. (WFLA) - A Haines City man is facing a DUI charge after police say he hit a cruiser while driving a lawnmower then accused cops of poisoning him and putting cocaine in his system.

The crash happened around 7 p.m. Saturday outside Rodriguez Fashion on US-17/92 North. An officer was inside when he heard a loud noise come from outside where his cruiser was parked.

When the officer walked outside, he says he spotted 68-year-old Gary Wayne Anderson on a lawnmower with an attached trailer. The officer also noted there was minor damage to the back bumper on his police car.

According to police, Anderson admitted he was drunk and hit the cruiser but claimed he didn't cause any damage. Officers say he couldn't complete field sobriety tests and noted that his demeanor ""ranged from laughing to aggressive.""

After he was taken to the police department, Anderson asked to be taken to a hospital because he claimed he had been poisoned by police, officers say.

Anderson was taken to Heart of Florida Regional Medical Center, where he provided a breathalyzer sample. According to police, his blood-alcohol content was .241 - more than three times the legal limit.

Officers say Anderson also had cocaine in his system. Anderson accused police of putting the cocaine in his system, ""while directing profane language and racial slurs at the officer,"" police say.

""I'm proud of the professional demeanor our officers showed when dealing with this heavily-intoxicated, belligerent offender,"" Chief Jim Elensky said.

According to a police department spokesman, Anderson's driver's license has been suspended since March 1978. He also has two prior DUI convictions.

Man accused of trying to hit Lyft driver after car crash in Aventura,"Carlos Camilo Nino, 61, is accused of assaulting a Lyft driver in Aventura, police said.

AVENTURA, Fla. - A Hollywood man was arrested Sunday after he tried to hit a Lyft driver with whom he had just been involved in a car crash, authorities said.

According to an arrest report, the Lyft driver, Cynthia Rodriguez, told Aventura police that she was stopped in the middle lane at the intersection of Perimeter Road and Northeast 29th Place with two passengers in her SUV when a black Nissan struck her vehicle and continued straight on Perimeter Road.

Police said Rodriguez pulled into the parking lot of the Aventura Library at 19525 Biscayne Blvd. and the black Nissan pulled up behind her.

According to the arrest report, the driver of the Nissan, Carlos Camilo Nino, 61, got out of his car and pounded on the window of Rodriguez's SUV while yelling at her.

Police said Rodriguez rolled down the window and Nino attempted to hit her but missed.

Rodriguez warned Nino that she had pepper spray and that he need to get back, authorities said.

Police said he eventually retreated toward his car after she told him to get back numerous times.

According to the arrest report, Nino slapped Rodriguez's hand after she got out of her SUV to take a picture of his driver's license.

His wife then pulled him away from Rodriguez and the couple got back into their car and drove away, the report stated.

A police officer arrived at the scene a short time later and Nino eventually returned and spoke with the officer, authorities said.

Police said Nino claimed Rodriguez was the one who struck his car and that she tried to flee the scene of the crash.

Authorities said the two passengers in Rodriguez's SUV were interviewed and they both substantiated Rodriguez's series of events.

Nino was then arrested on charges of burglary, assault and battery. His vehicle was towed from the scene due to his wife not having a valid driver's license, authorities said.

Texas man recovering after shark bite in Florida,"CLOSE Paul Kelly said the worst part of the day was losing the tarpon he was trying to reel in. Fort Myers News-Press

The worst part of a Texas man's trip to Florida wasn't when he got bit by a shark on a fishing trip.

It's when he lost the tarpon he was trying to reel in.

Speaking from the Lee Memorial Hospital on Saturday, Paul Kelly, 72, said it was still a good trip overall.

""We lost the fish of course,"" Kelly said. ""That was the worst part.""

Kelly said he was on a six-hour fishing trip with his good friend and a boat captain in Boca Grande Pass on Wednesday.

Near the end of the trip, both he and his friend had hooked sizable tarpon, he said.

Kelly said he was trying to work in a 150-pound tarpon when his shoe slipped and he was yanked into the water by the fish.

While he was underwater, Kelly said he felt something hit his leg. He didn't realize at the time it was a shark nibbling on it.

The captain pulled him to the boat with a fishing rod, and his buddy hoisted him into the boat by his belt.

Once he was in the boat, the captain told him a shark had bitten him, and that it appeared to be an eight to 10-foot bull shark, Kelly said.

That's when he noticed a gash around his left knee and calf, he said.

The men acted quickly, wrapping a belt around his left thigh to stop the bleeding as they raced to shore. Paramedics swarmed him, dressing his leg and securing a tourniquet. Kelly was airlifted to the trauma center.

Surgeons stitched him up, and he had surgery on a torn tendon in his knee the next day.

The Vietnam veteran said he barely felt pain through the whole incident or post surgery.

""You do the best with what you get,"" he said.

Doctors told him he should be able to leave the hospital in the next few days. He and his wife hope to return to Texas on Monday.

The trauma surgeon who treated Kelly, Robert L'Connor, said he's seen alligator bites, but never a shark bite.

""They aren't that frequent to be honest with you,"" L'Connor said. ""It's something everybody is concerned with when they get into the water, but it's the first one I've seen in 10 years.""

It demonstrates the necessity of the trauma center, which serves trauma patients from the surrounding five counties and just celebrated its 25th year in business, L'Connor said.

Though Florida annually tops the leader board for attacks in the United States, bites plummeted last year compared with previous years, according to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), a University of Florida database that tracks shark attacks worldwide.

There were 16 confirmed attacks in Florida last year, compared to 31 in 2017, according to ISAF data.

In Lee and Collier counties, 16 attacks have been confirmed by ISAF, which keeps records dating back to 1882.

In 2005, a young Austrian tourist was bitten on the right ankle in Lee County. Then in 2007, a shark bit a man off a Naples beach.

In 2001, a Lee County Sheriff's Office captain who was then a part-time fishing guide was bit by a blacktip shark.

Rick Scott: U.S. military action in Venezuela may become a necessity,"Rick Scott, a Republican, represents Florida in the Senate.

I am not interested in “nation-building.” And as a Navy veteran, I am very cautious when it comes to the idea of using military force. I hate to disappoint those who want the United States to right all the world’s wrongs, but long ago I came to terms with the fact that we cannot do that.

I do want the United States to continue to be a beacon of hope and freedom, but we simply cannot commit military forces unless we absolutely must.

Which brings me to Venezuela. I was at the border between Colombia and Venezuela a few weeks ago. What is happening in Venezuela is a human tragedy. Let’s look at the facts:

The United Nations estimates that 3.4 million refugees have fled the country. Almost 90 percent of the population lives in poverty, and shortages of food and medicine are becoming desperate.

This is a man-made crisis. Nicolás Maduro, the ruthless dictator of Venezuela, is killing his own citizens, including women and children. Venezuela has a legitimate constitutional leader: Juan Guaidó, who, as president of the National Assembly, the last democratically elected body in the country, is constitutionally required to serve as interim president until new free and fair elections take place. President Trump has skillfully called the world’s attention to the situation, and has amassed the support of more than 50 countries that recognize Guaidó as the legitimate president.

As an aside, Democrats would do well to study Venezuela as they contemplate their current flirtation with the most discredited idea from the 20th century: socialism.

But, as I said, it is not the United States’ job to send our young men and women into harm’s way to right all of the world’s wrongs. So even if you conclude that the above list of facts does not justify the intervention of the United States, there is a massive and far-reaching problem I haven’t mentioned yet: our own self-interest.

Venezuela is in our hemisphere. Russian troops are already in Venezuela.

Do you think it would be in our national interest to allow the Russians — or the Cubans, the Iranians or Chinese — to install military bases there? Naval ports? Should we allow Hezbollah to roam free?

We must do all in our power to ensure that doesn’t happen.

Similarly, we don’t want a Syria in our hemisphere — a place where foreign powers and terrorist groups can set up camp and sow discord throughout the continent. Consider the ramifications this would have for our southern border and for the stability of the United States. This is not complicated.

There used to be a thing called the Monroe Doctrine; it was taught in history classes. President James Monroe made it clear in 1823 in his annual speech to Congress that the Western Hemisphere was closed to future colonization, and any attempt by a foreign power to oppress or control any nation in the Western Hemisphere would be viewed as a hostile act against the United States.

To that I say: amen. I have no interest in dictating anything to the people of Venezuela. But I absolutely do believe we should dictate a few things to the Russians, the Cubans and the Chinese. No, we will not allow you to set up shop in Venezuela. We will not allow you to take over that country, and we will not allow you to establish any military presence in our hemisphere. We should never allow another Cuba, and we must not stick our heads in the sand and pretend we don’t know what is going on.

When it comes to our security, the current migration crisis from Central America on our southern border will pale in comparison with the mass exodus the Maduro regime will unleash under the direction of Russia and Cuba. Dictators in Latin America have effectively used mass migration against the United States time and time again.

To be clear — I respect those who are cautious about the dangers of military intervention. I am generally among them. But it’s time to also acknowledge that inaction can be an equally dangerous course, if not more so. Doing nothing always seems safe, though it can be the most reckless and irresponsible course.

If the cause of freedom is crushed in Venezuela, and it results in foreign powers establishing a launching pad and outpost there for their hostility against the United States, we will look back on the spring of 2019 and wonder how it is that we were so shortsighted, how we ignored the wisdom of President Monroe. I pray that is not the case.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/rick-scott-us-military-action-in-venezuela-may-become-a-necessity/2019/05/09/0d49a480-72a9-11e9-9f06-5fc2ee80027a_story.html,2019-05-10T08:25:12Z,Washington Post,"1301 K St NW, Washington, DC 20071"
How Oregon is importing the SEC to the Pac-12,"EUGENE, Ore. -- After a long day of practice and on-campus recruiting visits, Mario Cristobal is finally catching his breath. It's nearing 5 p.m., but Oregon's head coach still has to meet with a group of high school coaches and crank his energy back up for a few more recruiting pitches before finally crawling into bed.

He's soaking up the temporary peace and walks a reporter to his giant, wooden bookshelf on the right side of his spacious office, which overlooks the Ducks' practice fields.

There sit 12 championship rings spanning his time as an assistant at Alabama, the head coach at Florida International and a two-time national champion while an offensive lineman at Miami (1989, 1991). Their diamonds shimmer in the waning light.

Cristobal picks up his 1989 national title ring from Miami and smiles.

""That feeling -- brother -- to be able to say to the whole world I am the best at what I do this particular year, that's unbelievable,"" Cristobal says. ""That, to me, is a game-changer.

""Addiction through the roof. I gotta have it. Gotta have it.""

Cristobal knows winning. During his time as a player at Miami and an assistant for the Hurricanes and at Alabama, Cristobal won three national titles and six conference championships. As FIU's head coach from 2007-12, he brought one of the nation's then worst football programs its first conference title in 2010.

Now, in his second year as Oregon's head coach, he's getting the winning feels again following a 9-4 debut after replacing Willie Taggart, who left after a year for Florida State. Cristobal has 17 starters back, including the possible top 2020 NFL draft pick in quarterback Justin Herbert, and five NFL-caliber offensive linemen.

He has the nation's best 2019 high school prospect already on campus -- and primed to start this fall -- and most of the way-too-early preseason Pac-12 prognostication is quacking in his favor.

Oregon, a premier college football program just a few years ago, is crawling back, and Cristobal senses urgency within the program. With a struggling Pac-12 wide open and Oregon holding arguably the conference's most talented roster, it feels like championship or bust in Eugene.

""We all came to Oregon knowing what it needs to be again,"" Cristobal told ESPN in April. ""There's so much momentum and so much ground being gained toward being that, that I see it as nothing but hunger and drive right now. I don't see it any other way, I don't feel it any other way inside.

""To me -- this team and this program -- I see this team as a team that can win multiple championships and continue to not only sustain but continue to elevate.""

Bringing the SEC out west

If you're going to compete with the best, you have to know what the best are like -- inside and out. So this spring, Cristobal and his staff went to Alabama and Georgia to take a deep dive into the DNA of two programs operating at the highest level in the sport to see how Oregon compared.

Cristobal soaked up the practices, meetings and atmosphere with Nick Saban and Kirby Smart like a giant sponge. He studied the bodies, movement and speed of the SEC freaks littering Tuscaloosa and Athens, silently comparing them to the physical makeup of his own team.

Before Cristobal and his staff left southern soil, he came away with an exciting realization.

Mario Cristobal has championship experience he wants to share with Oregon. Troy Wayrynen/USA TODAY Sports

'We've closed the gap considerably,"" Cristobal said. ""We have gained so much ground toward what we want to be.""

Cristobal is on a mission to duplicate SEC-like success and development at Oregon, and he thinks the gap between Oregon and his southern counterparts is closing because he has taken a lot of what he learned from Saban and implemented it into his own program.

He's building from the trenches up, which really started when he signed 6-foot-6, 349-pound franchise left tackle Penei Sewell in 2018. Oregon also has moved to a more functional strength training program that balances strength, speed, agility and flexibility under former Georgia assistant strength coach Aaron Feld.

The fantastically mustachioed Feld, who received a one-year contract extension through January 2021 and a salary bump from $200,000 to $310,000 for this year and next year, has been more technical than previous strength coaches, emphasizing workouts that prepare more for football movements than brute strength. It hasn't made workouts easier, as the Ducks actually lifted more this spring, hitting the weight room three to four times during practice weeks.

""Coach Feld changed our life, man,"" fifth-year senior offensive lineman Shane Lemieux said. ""We thought we were working before, but it was nothing.""

""Every single thing we do helps us on the football field, every single job, every single run you know, we're not doing wind sprints to kill us, we're doing wind sprints to prepare us for football.""

The recruiting strategy almost mirrors Saban's in the attention to detail in yearly evaluations and the type of athlete they're bringing in, especially along both lines of scrimmage.

Cristobal even deployed a Saban-like attack on the psychology inside Oregon's football facility, demanding a new kind of confidence and bullish mentality out of his players, coaches and any staff members inside the Casanova Center.

""The DNA of the program has to ooze out of everybody that's in the building,"" Cristobal said. ""It has to feel different when you walk through the door.

""You have to understand, I played at Miami. Our idea of pregame was Tolbert Bain standing up on the bench and saying, 'Hit, stick, and must stick. And what else? Talk s---!' And just go out there and whoop ass.""

That approach is changing the way Oregon operates. Chip Kelly went 46-7 with four straight BCS bowl berths at Oregon with a high-flying, blazing-fast offense. Cristobal isn't dumping all that speed and tempo, but he's working to build a more physical team on both sides of the ball.

While he admits he'd like to go faster on offense, Cristobal's mission is to make Oregon fun and nationally relevant again by operating with a more run-first, almost power-spread approach.

And players are on board. While last year's offensive numbers were decent (Oregon was third in the conference with 427.2 yards per game, but sixth with 5.86 YPP), Cristobal understands that inconsistency in games against Washington State, Arizona and Utah -- all losses -- and the ugly 7-6 bowl win over Michigan State can't continue if the Ducks are going to make title runs.

Cristobal thinks he now has more receiving targets to help Herbert, who threw for 3,151 yards and 29 touchdowns in his first full season as Oregon's starter last year. Freshmen Mycah Pittman, who had a solid spring, Joshua Delgado and Lance Wilhoite -- all ESPN 300 members -- are expected to make immediate impacts. Penn State grad transfer Juwan Johnson, who stands 6-4, 230, should complement veterans Jaylon Redd and Brenden Schooler well, as Oregon tries to replace record-setter Dillon Mitchell.

But the heart of this offense will be the running game, something that was sneaky good last year for the Ducks. The freshman duo of CJ Verdell and Travis Dye registered 1,757 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns (5.1 YPC) last season, and the plan is to feed them even more this fall.

The run-first mantra has Lemieux excited. He and his starting line buddies, who have accumulated more than 150 starts after enduring three different offenses in three years, are embracing this SEC-type training and style because they get to embrace their physical sides more.

""We feel like we've trained the hardest in the Pac-12 and when you look across at somebody when you're about to run block them [you think], man, this guy's not done anything that I've done,"" Lemieux said. ""You think about all the stuff that you've done in the past and how much more mentally and physically stronger you are and how much more you're going to dominate [them].""

It's the same with the defense, which is moving to a base 4-3, but will still have looks out of 3-4 and 4-2-5 formations. The thought of having a more exotic defense was hatched after former defensive coordinator Jim Leavitt and the school mutually parted ways, making way for former Boise State DC Andy Avalos.

Cristobal said he targeted Avalos because of how his defenses ""really understand how to tie in the front to the back"" but with so many different types of players for the different schemes this group has seen over the last few years, multiple looks make it easier for more guys to fit in.

""We have the personnel to run any type of defense in the nation,"" senior linebacker Troy Dye said. ""Because of the chaotic way that we've had to recruit over the last couple of years, we have a lot of different body types that can be either defensive ends or outside linebackers. We have big guys who can run, and good, intangible pieces that I think Coach Avalos' defense is going to show that this year.""

The California pipeline

Cristobal is sitting in the back room of a dimly lit restaurant, inhaling his favorite dish at one of his favorite dining spots.

Green curry, brown rice, double chicken, medium spice.

He just came from hosting recruits at another dinner down the street, but with so much mingling, this is his first meal in hours, and it's being shoveled off his plate at an alarming speed.

When it comes to recruiting, food can be an afterthought, and Cristobal is learning that more and more at Oregon.

""It's an ungodly amount of time, effort,"" Cristobal said. ""But you have to, man. You have to take a deep dive into your guys.""

Cristobal comes from the Saban school of ruthless, relentless recruiting that powers the elites. He's the guy who helped get blue-chip prospects such as Cam Robinson, Calvin Ridley, Jerry Jeudy, Minkah Fitzpatrick, Jonah Williams, Da'Ron Payne, Quinnen Williams and Alex Leatherwood to Tuscaloosa a few years back.

Cristobal is starting off well, as Oregon's 2019 class was the best class for the Ducks ever on paper. They were ranked sixth by ESPN with 10 of its 25 signees being ESPN 300 members, including No. 1 overall recruit Kayvon Thibodeaux, a defensive end out of Los Angeles. Cristobal signed 21 ESPN 300 members in his first two classes.

What really stood out was the raiding of California. A pipeline that helped make Kelly so successful during his time in Eugene, Cristobal hit the Golden State even harder, signing 12 from there, eight being ESPN 300 members or four-star prospects.

With #ScoDucks lighting up Twitter as Southern California prospects' Bat Signal, Cristobal took full advantage of the recent struggles of USC and UCLA by signing seven of the state's top 50 players. USC and UCLA combined to sign eight.

Just like he did with the states of Florida and Georgia while at Alabama, Cristobal is making California, the most fertile talent ground on the West Coast, his staff's primary recruiting area.

""The Oregon brand is pretty big in Southern California,"" he said. ""That's got to be your footprint, right? The state of California, we see it as an extension of the state of Oregon. We just attacked it, man.""

'It's a battle every day'

Thibodeaux's introduction to college football didn't exactly go as planned. Admittedly very confident in his abilities, Thibodeaux strutted into his first Ducks practice with his head up and chest out, only to be pushed around and dinged up on Day 1. The speed and tenacity of a college practice was foreign to him, especially with only helmets on. It ""knocked [his] spirits down"" and the veteran offensive linemen opposite him quickly reminded him that he was no longer the biggest, baddest person on the field.

""It's a battle every day,"" said Thibodeaux, who could still be growing at 6-5, 240 pounds. ""So if you don't bring your A-game, you will get buried.""

Thibodeaux has since recalibrated and became one of Oregon's most consistent spring performers, but his teammates say practices were a little nastier and more intense this spring. Lemiuex said that the previous two staffs weren't fans of starters vs. starters during spring practice, but this staff loves it. It was grueling, but Lemieux said it paid off with the vast improvements he thinks this team made in 15 practices.

""Spring ball here is fall camp, man,"" he said. ""I like it that way though. We've developed a standard of a culture of iron sharpens iron.

""Now we're operating at such a high level that we set our standard as that. Our worst practice now would probably be one of our best practices of Coach [Mark] Helfrich.""

Cristobal wants his team to embody the blue-collar mentality similar to the one he had growing up in south Miami, where the smell of battery acid and oil sometimes filled the house with a mechanic father around.

And it will be important for that mentality to carry over to the very first game of the season: Week 1 in Arlington, Texas, against Auburn.

Auburn began last season by defeating eventual Pac-12 champion Washington in Atlanta 21-16, all but immediately erasing the Pac-12's playoff hopes. Oregon players and coaches know that this season's opener will likely go a long way toward reviving or ending the Pac-12's 2019 playoff hopes.

Lemieux calls the opener a statement game for this program, especially with the changes made to get closer to looking like this exact opponent. But he also understands that Oregon has to ""carry the torch for the Pac-12,"" as the conference looks to regain national respect.

That's a lot of pressure for a team that won just nine games last year, but Lemieux and Dye, who have now seen three different head coaches in four springs, say a win would galvanize the conference and this program. If the Ducks want to deliver on their front-runner status and return some national respect to Eugene, beating Auburn is a must.

The hope is a win will also serve as a jump-off for a Pac-12 title and playoff run, two things the Ducks haven't seen since losing to Ohio State in the College Football Playoff National Championship following the 2014 season. It has been a long road for some of these older Ducks, and now that there's finally stability, they're ready to matter again.

""My class' goal was to take Oregon back like to what it was and leave it off better than how I found it,"" Lemiuex said. ""If we didn't win a Pac-12 championship, Rose Bowl or playoff, we wouldn't -- I wouldn't -- live up my goals and our team's goals.""",http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/26710729/how-oregon-importing-sec-pac-12,2019-05-09T17:34:47Z,ESPN.com,"ESPN Plaza Bristol, CT 06010"

Costliest bet they'll ever make: $29 bet leads to $25K fine,"ATLANTIC CITY — A gambler from Nevada lost $29 on a New Jersey internet gambling site, but the transactions cost a technology company $25,000.

New Jersey regulators fined Gaming Innovation Group $25,000 for a flaw in its geolocation technology, which is designed to make sure people are within the state's borders before they can gamble.

The state Division of Gaming Enforcement says the Malta-based company, which provides online gambling for Atlantic City's Hard Rock casino, had a technical vulnerability last summer.

It allowed a patron trying to access the Hard Rock's gambling site from Nevada to inspect the browser code and change data to falsely indicate that the patron was located in New Jersey.

On July 4, a geolocation company was checking the system at Hard Rock's request when it found the vulnerability. Patron access to the system was shut down and a fix was put in place the next day.

The case goes to the heart of the legality of internet gambling in the U.S.

In New Jersey, gamblers must be physically present within the state in order to gamble online. The way companies ensure this is through geolocation, a multi-layered series of technologies that determine where a person is at the time he or she is trying to place a bet.

In this case, the gaming enforcement division determined, Gaming Innovation did not take adequate steps ensure that the computer server made the final call on whether a patron was within New Jersey. Instead, the patron was able to trick the system.

The company calls it a one-time incident that was quickly reported and fixed.

""This one-off single incidence of out-of-state gambling was due to a technical vulnerability which was quickly discovered and reported to the regulator in New Jersey in the first week the company went live in New Jersey,"" Gaming Innovation said in a statement. ""An end user from outside the state of New Jersey with technical knowledge managed to access the front end debugger to change the location and pretend to be from New Jersey.""

The company said it maintains controls to make sure it complies with regulations ""at all times.""

It wasn't the first such mishap; in March, New Jersey gambling regulators ordered a California man to hand over more than $90,000 from online accounts he had funded and gambled with from outside the state.

In a separate enforcement action, the division fined the Borgata casino $7,500 for taking prohibited sports bets.

On Dec. 8, the casino accepted bets on two college basketball games, Clemson vs. Mississippi State, and Connecticut vs. Florida State. Both games were played at the Prudential Center in Newark.

State law prohibits betting on New Jersey college teams, or any college games held within the state, even if it involves teams from elsewhere in the country.

The casino refunded all wagers on those games.

It declined to comment on the fine.",https://www.burlingtoncountytimes.com/news/20190509/costliest-bet-theyll-ever-make-29-bet-leads-to-25k-fine?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T13:32:27Z,Burlington County Times,"4284 US-130, Willingboro, NJ 08046, USA"
"Montgomery gay nightclub closes: 'It's time to do a change,' owner says","Downtown Montgomery club known for drag shows was a force for gay rights; bar may reopen after 'high end' makeover

With drinks in hand, guests were all around the bar talking, playing darts and pool, and dancing under the huge disco ball for one last party.

The crowd was a mix of first-timers, regulars and old friends at Montgomery’s Club 322.

Some were gay, some straight. When Harlow “The Hit Man” Caldwell polled the crowd from the stage during the drag show, he got the biggest reaction by asking, “Where are my freaks at?”

Downtown said farewell to this landmark club last May 4.

“It’s time to do a change,” said club owner Jerry Cook said. “Exactly what that change is, I’m not sure.”

Cook said it wasn’t an easy choice to close the club, which was known as much for gay rights activism as for fun times. But he said that the decision came “really fast.” The club’s social media is even going offline soon.

“It’s been crazy. It’s been up and down,” Cook said. “We’ve had a lot of good times, a lot of good things.”

But the bar may not be gone forever.

“We want to revamp,” Cook said. “We want to move forward with the times, so we’ll shut down for a while and get things cleaned up.”

Cook said the goal is to make 322’s facility into a higher end club. “With all the stuff going on downtown, with the Biscuits and everything, we want to move forward with it,” Cook said.

Cook can’t say for certain yet when, or even if, the club will return. “I’m not saying we’re going to reopen,” Cook said. “I’m just not saying that we’re not going to.”

The club has operated on North Lawrence Street since 2006, with drag shows on most Friday and Saturday nights. If or when they reopen, he said there are no thoughts of relocating to another area.

Among the guests partying Saturday was Danielle Powers, who has been going to Club 322 since she was a teenager — the club was open for ages 18 and up. Powers said 322 was a true part of the River Region’s LBGTQ community. “Jerry Cook is a really good man,” she said. “Some of the most upstanding people come from here.”

If there was a driving force behind 322’s origins, Cook said that it was the late drag queen Gayla DeLust, who died in 2014. A large portrait of her hangs in 322’s entrance. Cook said he met DeLust in 1983. “She worked with me at another business I owned,” Cook said. “She was just a good person. I’ve never known anybody to have anything negative to say about her.”

From 322’s beginning nearly 13 years ago, Cook said his bar has been a place for everybody. “You don’t have to worry about race, gender, sex or whatever,” he said. “They could just come do what they wanted. That was from day one.”

As a gay club set up in the heart of the South, Cook said they’ve faced surprisingly little backlash. He praised Montgomery's efforts with them. “The city has pretty much embraced us really well, and helped us,” he said. “They’ve helped to make sure we had a safe environment, that we didn’t have any problems here. The city’s been behind us a lot.”

It’s a club that’s stood at the forefront of local and statewide battles for gay rights. Cook’s proud of their work with drag queen and activist Ambrosia Starling against former Alabama Supreme Court Justice and political candidate Roy Moore over stances on gay marriage.

The club also stood up against hate. In 2016, they were part of national memorials to victims of the Pulse Nightclub shooting massacre in Orlando, Florida.

322 was a focal point for annual Montgomery Pride marches to the Alabama State Capitol steps, which this year takes place June 29-30. Cook said seeing the giant rainbow flag and being able to introduce Starling there were real highlights.

It's been a club full of celebration, including hosting a pageant for Miss Montgomery Pride on April 19. They also recently began hosting open stage talent nights on Thursdays.

The club has stood by local members of the LGBTQ community through hard times as well. In April, they held a memorial service for 322 family member Steven M. Seale, who died March 29, and raised funds for his expenses.

Cook, who also owns The Shack on Atlanta Highway, said he’s made lifelong friends through 322.

“I really appreciate all the support that we’ve had over the years,” Cook said. “We’ve had a lot of fun. We’ve had a lot of good parties.”

Florida Republicans warn Trump not to arrive in storm-torn Panhandle empty-handed,"A person in Washington with knowledge of President Donald Trump’s visit said he was hesitant to commit while Republicans and Democrats in Congress continue to feud over a disaster relief package. | Chris Kleponis-Pool/Getty Images Florida Republicans warn Trump not to arrive in storm-torn Panhandle empty-handed

TALLAHASSEE — Florida Republicans have warned the White House that a planned campaign rally in Panama City on Wednesday needs to include an announcement of aid for the storm-torn region, but as of late Tuesday the Trump administration had made no guarantees, according to three people with knowledge of the president’s plans.

Party officials have told President Donald Trump to arrive in the Panhandle with something more than rhetoric for residents, who are still still living among piles of destruction left by Hurricane Michael seven months ago. U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz and Gov. Ron DeSantis met with Trump at the White House on Monday to discuss the campaign rally. After the meeting, Gaetz said Monday night that no decisions about an announcement had been made.

Story Continued Below

A person in Washington with knowledge of Trump’s visit said the president was hesitant to commit while Republicans and Democrats in Congress continue to feud over a disaster relief package that would send hundreds of millions of dollars to the Panhandle. A sticking point in those talks has been Trump's reluctance to provide more money to Puerto Rico, which is a top priority for House Democrats.

DeSantis in April had asked Trump to increase Federal Emergency Management Agency funding after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration determined that Hurricane Michael was more damaging than originally thought and upgraded it to a Category 5 storm.

The Florida Legislature set aside $1.8 billion toward recovery funding as part of a $91 billion spending package lawmakers sent to DeSantis last week. The federal funding would reimburse those state dollars, but Triumph Gulf Coast Consortium Chairman Don Gaetz — Matt Gaetz’s father — said what matters more to Panhandle residents is an explanation.

""I think what the president owes everyone an explanation,"" Don Gaetz said Tuesday. ""The people in the Panhandle want to know why the funding is being held up and what he's going to do about it.""

Triumph is a nonprofit board that was created to distribute settlement money from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The board agreed to provide $15 million toward storm recovery costs.

Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, a Republican, said he expects Trump to make FEMA responsible for 90 percent of Michael’s recovery costs, an increase from the current 75 percent.

“That’s a lot of money and it would bring a lot of relief to communities that have been hurting,” Patronis told POLITICO on Tuesday. ""If I were a betting man I'd say he'd approve the 90-10 [percent] funding.“

Patronis said Trump's campaign team had originally planned a 7 p.m. campaign event, but have agreed to add a Wednesday morning tour of Tyndall Air Force Base, which was hit hard by the storm.

Hurricane Michael rivals Hurricane Andrew as one of the worst to hit the state.

“These people deserve something,” said Patronis, who lost the hospital where he was born to the storm. “Why would he come out to one of the most devastated parts of the state without good news?”

Trump campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump will arrive at Tyndall on Air Force One with Republican U.S. Rep. Neal Dunn, whose district includes Panama City. Dunn said his office helped the White House make plans for the rally.

“I think one of the reasons he’s going there is because of our constant nagging,” Dunn said. “We’ve been doing that since day one.”",https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2019/05/07/florida-republicans-warn-trump-not-to-arrive-in-storm-torn-panhandle-empty-handed-1010176,2019-05-08T00:37:39Z,POLITICO,"1100 Wilson Blvd Suite 601 Arlington, VA 22209 United States"
1 dead in STEM school shooting outside Denver,"HIGHLANDS RANCH, Colo. (WFLA/AP) - At least one person is dead after a shooting at a STEM school outside of Denver, according to KUSA.

That person's identity has not been released.

Initial reports said eight students were admitted to hospitals.

A shooting at a suburban Denver middle school injured seven people Tuesday, and two suspects were in custody, authorities said.

KUSA reports the suspects are one juvenile boy and an adult man. Officials said they believe both are students at the school.

According to KUSA, the shooters walked into the school and engaged students in two seperate locations.

Lines of firetrucks, ambulances and law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies were at the school and medical helicopters landed on a grassy field.

The shooting occurred at the middle school at STEM School Highlands Ranch, a public charter with more than 1,850 students in kindergarten through 12th grades.

The sheriff’s office said deputies responded around 1:50 p.m. to the school in the Highlands Ranch community about 15 miles south of Denver.

"Semi crashes on I-75 NB in Marion, forcing lane closures","The driver, a 54-year-old Citrus County man, was taken to Ocala Regional Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries

The driver of a semi was taken to a hospital in stable condition after the big rig he was driving crashed into a guard rail on Interstate 75 north of Ocala late Monday night.

A Florida Highway Patrol trooper on scene said the 54-year-old Citrus County man was taken to Ocala Regional Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries. His name was not initially released.

He had to be pulled from the truck by Marion County firefighters using the Jaws of Life device to rescue him.

The truck was northbound on I-75 in the left lane when, for unknown reasons, the driver veered onto the west shoulder and took out about 100 feet of guard rail. The semi tipped over on the driver's side, trapping the man.

He was hauling 41,000 pounds of bananas, troopers said. The cargo remained intact.

Two other vehicles were struck by debris. Those drivers were not injured.

Worcester man charged with 5th OUI,"BOURNE — A Worcester man pleaded not guilty to his fifth drunken driving offense Monday in Falmouth District Court.

Peter Bonasia, 54, was arraigned on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol, fifth offense; negligent operation of a motor vehicle; possessing an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle; and speeding, according to court documents. He is being held on $1,000 bail, is ordered not to drive and must remain alcohol free.

On Sunday at roughly 3:30 p.m., troopers were on the lookout for an erratic driver approaching the Bourne Bridge in a black Kia Forte, according to a state police report.

A trooper saw the vehicle pass by with the driver’s side window “completely down” while heavy rain was falling. The officer pursued the driver — later identified as Bonasia — who had “both hands on the wheel with his head appearing to be slowly dipping down” as if falling asleep, the report says. The trooper clocked his speed at greater than 90 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the report.

The trooper stopped Bonasia as he was forced to slow down due to vehicles ahead of him. He failed several field sobriety tests, the report says. Troopers allegedly found two empty pints of Jose Cuervo, 80 proof; two empty nips of Jose Cuervo and one full nip of Jose Cuervo in the vehicle.

<p>A fight ensued and the Felix Varela student pulled out a knife and stabbed the other teens just as students and staffers were leaving the campus for the day, Calzadilla said. </p>

<p>""Following a thorough investigation involving interviews with witnesses and involved parties, it was determined that the hospitalized victims were the main aggressors,"" Calzadilla said.</p>

<p>She said all four teenagers will face charges. The teens who were stabbed will be charged with burglary and battery while the Felix Varela student will be charged with possession of a weapon on school grounds.</p>

<p>The teenagers enrolled in Miami-Dade schools will also be disciplined according to the code of student conduct.</p>

<p>Two of the victims attend another public school in Miami-Dade County while the third boy no longer attends public school in the county, Calzadilla said.</p>

Clermont man on trial in hit-and-run death,"TAVARES — When Aaron Zacharias was struck by a hit-and-run driver on Dec. 6, 2015, he suffered injuries as severe as if he had fallen from a four-story building, a pathologist testified Tuesday.

“It was significant force,” said Dr. Wendy Lavezzi, deputy chief medical examiner for the 5th Judicial Circuit, which includes Lake County.

Lavezzi said Zacharias' spinal column was “transected” and his brain stem was torn in two. He had a broken femur, hemorrhages to the head and abrasions, she said. The prosecutor also had her hold up the victim’s clothing so the jury could see what he had been wearing.

“He wouldn’t have been able to get up and walk around?” asked Assistant State Attorney Jason Nimeth.

“No,” she replied.

David J. Sheets, 52, of Clermont, faces charges of failing to stop for a crash involving death, a first-degree felony, and leaving the scene of an accident with property damage, a second-degree misdemeanor.

He told Florida Highway Patrol troopers that he thought he might have hit a deer or “zoned out” and hit a mailbox at 11 p.m. while traveling south on Lakeshore Drive. He said he stopped and went back to the area but could not see anything, according to the investigative report.

FHP investigators concluded that 26-year-old Zacharias was crossing Lakeshore near Preston Cove Road when he was struck by a vehicle. FHP found pieces of Bondo, a material used to repair dents in vehicles. They also found the pedestrian’s flashlight, which was turned on, a cellphone and other items.

Investigators concluded the collision vaulted Zacharias 55 feet from the point of collision and his right shoe more than 73 feet.

Two days after the crash, Lake County Sheriff’s Deputy Bret Rutzebeck called FHP and said his friend, Sheets, called him and told him he had read a news account of Zacharias’ death.

Sheets met the deputy and a trooper in his driveway and said, “I believe this is the vehicle the Florida Highway Patrol is looking for.”

The trooper noticed the dented area in the black 1968 pickup truck where the Bondo had been knocked loose, and other damage.

Sheets said he drank two or three beers that afternoon — about five hours before the crash. He said he had driven to a storage unit in the minutes leading up to the accident.

Man found guilty in fatal drunken driving crash,"NAPLES — A Florida man has been convicted in a fatal drunken driving crash.

The Naples Daily News reported that 29-year-old Kiereek Seymour was found guilty of DUI manslaughter on Monday. His sentencing is set for June 26. A previous trial ended in a mistrial after a juror complained of feeling uncomfortable during deliberations.

Authorities said Seymour had mixed alcohol with prescription anxiety medication in May 2014 before a crash at an East Naples intersection that left 54-year-old Sandra Marie Maddux dead.

Men face felony murder charges in fatal shooting outside McDonald's,"ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - Two men have been arrested in connection with a shooting outside a McDonald's last month that left a man dead and a woman injured, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies announced Tuesday morning the arrests of Shaddrick Wright, 20, and Deon Justice, 19, on first-degree felony murder charges.

The shooting happened April 25 at 12:14 a.m.outside the fast-food restaurant on North Pine Hills Road.

The victim, 19-year-old Jamario Dixon, and his brother went to the McDonald's to sell a gun to Justice, documents show. Justice and Wright both shot at the vehicle Dixon was in, hitting him in the shoulder, according to the report.

Deputies said surveillance video showed Justice and Wright running away after the shooting. At least nine shots were fired, the report said.

Dixon's brother drove him to Orlando Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

Wright's 19-year-old girlfriend, who was driving the Volkswagen Jetta in which the two suspects arrived, was also shot in the back of the head during the shooting, records show.

Deputies said Wright moved her from the driver's seat to the passenger's seat then drove her to his mother's house and his mother drove her to ORMC. The story Wright provided deputies did not match with the surveillance video and forensic evidence recovered from the scene, the report said.

Both men are being held at the Orange County Jail without bond.

Record tiger shark caught near Marco Island,"Mark Stock landed what he said is a record class tiger shark on April 25 while fishing off Marco Island with charter Captain Ben Olsen. The creature measured 14 ½ feet.

The current state record is a 1,065-pound tiger shark measured at 12 ½ feet and caught out of Pensacola waters in 1981. Stock’s shark was estimated to weigh more than 1,100 pounds, but its exact weight will never be known as it was immediately released.

Olsen said he’s caught tiger sharks exceeding 12 feet but “this shark was truly special, and our number-one priority was to get her released in good shape, as quickly as possible.”

Beth Deacy, a biologist with NOAA Fisheries Panama City Lab and head of its shark-tagging program, told Stock that based on this shark’s length in comparison with similar sized tigers, she would most likely put its age between 15 and 20 years.

Jacksonville man who was sentenced to life in prison is now free,"<p>A Jacksonville man who was sentenced to life in prison received another chance at freedom thanks to State Attorney Melissa Nelson. </p><p>In 2012, Sam Hughlon was 35 years old and already considered a habitual felony offender after a Duval County judge sentenced him to life in prison for armed robbery. Hughlon served seven years of that life sentence and managed to get his conviction amended, which led to his freedom. </p><p>""It's hard to explain the way that life sentence feels. I lay in that bed at night facing that wall, tears in my eyes, thinking, 'I'm going to actually die in here for something I didn't do,'"" Hughlon told News4Jax on Monday.</p><p>Police said Hughlon robbed a woman at gunpoint at a North Jacksonville home in 2012. Hughlon was living there at the time of the incident. </p><p>""I explained to them that I didn't do the armed robbery,"" Hughlon said. ""If they actually investigated the things I told them to investigate, they would see that I'm actually innocent.""</p><p>Police didn't buy his explanation of events and Hughlon, who was already a convicted felon, found himself back in the criminal justice system. The case went to trial and he lost. The judge sentenced him to life in prison.</p><p>""They said (the reasoning was) because I was a habitual offender,"" Hughlon explained. </p><p>While in prison, Hughlon fought to have his case appealed.</p><p>""After I lost the trial, my attorney was able to get the evidence that I was asking her to get from the get-go that the judge wouldn't let me get,"" he said. ""So I had that evidence.""</p><p>That evidence included phone records, depositions and inconsistent statements from the accuser.</p><p>Hughlon filed an appeal to his conviction based on the evidence that he said was not present during his trial. He even wrote letters to Nelson. A judge finally granted him an evidentiary hearing, which led to prosecutors offering him a plea deal to a lesser charge. </p><p>""The state came to me and said, 'Look, we prefer not to have an evidentiary hearing. We prefer to not pursue this any further if you're willing to go ahead and accept an offer,'"" Hughlon said.</p><p>He said the state offered to reduce the armed robbery charge to simple robbery, which is a far lesser felony that would have put him behind bars for only eight years. He accepted the post-conviction plea deal and was given credit for already serving seven years. On Tuesday, he was released from prison.</p><p>Although Hughlon was freed from a life sentence in prison, he's still considered a convicted felon in the 2012 armed robbery case. News4Jax asked Hughlon why he would accept a lower charge if he didn't do it.</p><p>""Any sane person with a life sentence would do what I did,"" he replied. ""I got another chance to be free again.""</p><p>But freedom isn't actually free. Had it not been for a relative who allows him to live with her until he can get back on his feet, Hughlon would be on the streets because he had no other place to live after he was released. Now, he's starting over with nothing and hoping the public will help him by donating to the Helping Hands for Simple Demands group, which aims to help people get back on their feet. </p><p>Given his criminal past, Hughlon said he realizes he can't afford to make any mistakes from here on out. He hopes young people will learn from his experience. </p><p>""A life sentence is no joke. It hurts,"" Hughlon said. ""You don't think about it when you're out here.

"Former Ormond Beach officer tried to hide drugs in pants after crash, deputies say","PALM COAST, Fla. - A Florida man who identified himself as a former police officer after being involved in a crash is facing charges of driving under the influence and possession of marijuana, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies said they were called to the intersection of U.S. 1 South and Seminole Woods Boulevard in Palm Coast Sunday afternoon after a crash with injuries was reported.

When deputies arrived, they found Brenton Hodge, 55, in the driver's seat of a blue Nissan Altima, which had damage to its rear end, according to a report from the Sheriff's Office. A silver Mercedes was found nearby with damage to its front end, the report said.

A deputy at the scene approached Hodge and found him messing with a cooler in the floorboard of the car, according to the report. The deputy said Hodge smelled of alcohol and was slurring his words.

When the deputy asked Hodge what was in the cooler, Hodge replied, ""Nothing,"" according to body camera video from the crash scene.

“Where were you drinking at? “This car reeks of booze, man,” the deputy said.

When the deputy asked why, Hodge said it was because he was taking his trash out earlier and it had a lot of beer cans in it that leaked onto his seat, the video showed.

When the deputy continued asking about the crash and why Hodge's vehicle smelled like alcohol, Hodge told the deputy he was drinking earlier in the day but was just sitting at the intersection with his blinker, waiting to make a U-turn, when the driver of the Mercedes hit the back of his vehicle.

A witness at the scene said it appeared that Hodge had his left blinker on and was trying to make a U-turn but was in the middle or right turning lane.

A short time later, Hodge identified himself as a retired Ormond Beach police officer, deputies said.

“I know where you’re going. I’m a retired cop.” Hodge told the deputy as he flashed what the Sheriff's Office said was a badge.

When getting out of the Altima, Hodge grabbed a bag of what deputies believed was marijuana and tried to shove it down his pants in front of them, the report said.

“Trying to shove weed down your pants? Are you kidding me?” the deputy said.

Multiple beer cans, including some that had been opened, were found in his vehicle, deputies said.

Hodge, whose airbags were deployed, then told deputies he wanted to go to the hospital, after initially telling one deputy he did not need medical attention, the video showed.

He was taken to Advent Health to be treated for his injuries before being booked into jail on charges of marijuana possession over 20 grams and driving under the influence, deputies said.

[MORE: Kissimmee police look for 3 suspects accused of posing as officers | More victims come forward after Deltona man arrested for impersonating an officer]

The driver of the other vehicle was also taken to the hospital to be treated for injuries, deputies said.

Flagler County Sheriff Rick Staly said regardless of Hodge's being a retired officer, he would still be held accountable for his actions.

""As a former law enforcement officer, he should be well aware of the dangers of drinking and driving. It is disappointing that he thought he could manipulate the situation by showing our deputies his retired badge and trying to [stuff] his drugs down his pants,"" Staly said. ""None of his tactics worked. If you drink and drive in Flagler County, you will go to jail. No exceptions, no excuses.""

"Florida Man Shows Police His Marijuana Plants, Gets Arrested","For some reason, Arthur Carracino thought it was a good idea to show police where he grew his marijuana plant.

The 65-year-old met officers outside of his home, wearing nothing but a blue Speedo and an unbuttoned flannel shirt. Police body cameras caught the entire bizarre interaction.

""You gotta smoke a bowl with me,"" Carracino can be heard saying at one point.

An officer responds, ""I can't.""

Carracino replies, ""Oh, I know, you're on duty.""

While recreational marijuana is illegal in Florida, medical marijuana is not.

Authorities can also be heard asking Carracino if he has a marijuana card, and he replies, ""Yeah, yeah I do, I'm working on it. I have the card.""

Police arrested Carracino and charged him with growing and cultivating marijuana.

Carracino was taken to Flagler County Jail and held on $1,500 bond.

Florida man claims demons made him batter pregnant woman,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

HUDSON, Fla. (WFLA) - A Pasco County man who was arrested for battering a pregnant woman claims demons took over his body and made him do it, deputies say.

Pasco deputies arrested 26-year-old Matthew Douglas Saturday night at his home in Hudson.

Deputies were called to the home around 10:30 to investigate a domestic battery call. When they got to the scene, deputies say Douglas refused to cooperate and wouldn't state his name.

Douglas was detained and put in the back of a patrol car. He later provided his name and admitted he didn't want to cooperate originally because he knew there was a warrant out for his arrest, deputies say.

According to the arrest report, Douglas told deputies demons took over his body and made him black out. He said that may have led him to become physical with his the pregnant woman, deputies noted in the report.

The victim, who is 18 weeks pregnant, told deputies she was playing Xbox Saturday night when Douglas told her to go to sleep. Douglas turned the game system off, but the victim turned it back on.

That's when the victim says Douglas grabbed her around the neck and started to choke her, the arrest report says. The victim told deputies she couldn't breathe and was scared. Deputies noted in the arrest report that the victim had a small area of bruising on her neck and three long scratch marks.

Jason Nichols: Trump's got a great economy and he's the incumbent -- But he's making it easy for Dems to win,"With a robust economy, most people would think it would be nearly impossible to defeat an incumbent president – and it should be under normal circumstances. But circumstances we are living under today are unfortunately far from normal.

President Trump – whose frequently criticized conduct and lies have become part of our daily lives – and his administration are giving Democrats a gift like we’ve never seen. That gift is something that was lacking during the 2016 election cycle, when Hillary Clinton got over 3 million more votes than Trump but lost the election as a result of his victory in the Electoral College.

The Trump team has gifted the Democratic Party a unifying message of restoring integrity to public office and law and order, even for those at the top. No one – even President Trump – is above the law, even though the president doesn’t seem to understand that.

TRUMP, AT FLORIDA RALLY, MOCKS 2020 FIELD: 'I WANT TO WATCH THAT ONE' WHEN BUTTIGIEG CUTS DEALS WITH CHINA'S XI

The concept of corrupt machine politics, with high-level officials who act like crime bosses, was once something that was believed to be a characteristic of local Democrats in major cities.

However, the Trump administrations has all of the trappings of the “Godfather” novel and films, including high-powered attorneys who disrupt investigations, cronies who are willing to fall on the sword for the boss, and children who are entrenched in the family business.

Criminal behavior and politics have always gone hand in hand. From Al Capone to Pablo Escobar, some criminals have gravitated toward politics and some politicians have gravitated toward crime.

Trump doesn’t stand among them because he hasn’t been criminally indicted. Fortunately for Trump, the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel has determined that a sitting president can’t be indicted for a federal crime.

More than 800 former federal prosecutors – including Republicans – have signed a letter stating: “Each of us believes that the conduct of President Trump described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report would, in the case of any other person not covered by the Office of Legal Counsel policy against indicting a sitting President, result in multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice.”

Apparently, because of this policy, the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller failed to recommend charges against the president regarding allegations that he obstructed justice in trying to interfere with the investigation of Russia’s meddling in our 2016 presidential election.

The candidate who emerges as the Democratic nominee for president from a crowded and talented field will make an argument for a scandal-free White House, respecting Congress as an equal branch of government as the Founding Fathers intended, and returning to honest respectful discourse and law and order.

Instead, Attorney General William Barr wrote in a letter to members of Congress: “Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.”

There you have it. Barr – a political appointee made attorney general by Trump after Trump forced the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions because Sessions wouldn’t act like the president’s defense attorney – knows he has to defend Trump or he’ll lose his job.

As for claims that Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia to put him in the White House, the Mueller report concluded that the Mueller investigation “did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

Nevertheless, while President Trump has been pretending that “no collusion” and “no obstruction” have been unquestionably established, he is certainly not acting like an innocent man with nothing to hide.

In fact, Trump’s move to exert executive privilege to stonewall legitimate congressional inquiries – refusing to provide documents and seeking to block witnesses from testifying before Congress – has all the marks of a mob boss trying to enforce a code of silence.

The president’s divisive tweeting and even racial and ethnic insensitivity probably would not have motivated or energized the Democratic base to hit the polls in sufficient numbers to send him into retirement, especially when the economy is adding jobs and wages are rising slightly.

Being opposed to the epidemic of corruption that has infected the Trump presidency is common ground between moderate liberals and progressives, between young and old, and between rural Democrats and urban ones.

But Trump’s disgraceful conduct, unprecedented rejection of traditional norms of behavior for an elected official, and defiance of congressional oversight make a mockery of Republican claims to be the party of law and order. The Democrats are now that party. That should convince some Trump voters from 2016 to abandon the president.

Trump and Attorney General William Barr could easily turn the tables on congressional Democrats by actually giving them what they want – let witnesses testify and provide documents. But the president refuses to do that, fighting every congressional subpoena, and insisting on keeping his tax returns secret.

Why? What does President Trump have to hide? No one forced him to run for president. When he became a candidate and then became president, he gave up some of the privacy that ordinary citizens enjoy.

Disagreements among Democrats over controversial proposals like reparations for descendants of enslaved people, universal basic income, “Medicare-for-all” and raising taxes on the wealthy once threatened to divide the party faithful.

However, being opposed to the epidemic of corruption that has infected the Trump presidency is common ground between moderate liberals and progressives, between young and old, and between rural Democrats and urban ones.

One question for Derek Jeter: Who are you kidding?,"NEW YORK, NY - MAY 14: Former New York Yankees great, Derek Jeter stands by his plaque during a pregame ceremony honoring Jeter and retiring his number 2 at Yankee Stadium on May 14, 2017 in New York City. (Photo by Rich Schultz/Getty Images)

One of the greatest winners in MLB history is on pace to lead the Miami Marlins to perhaps the worst season baseball has ever seen.

Derek Jeter tried to spread the blame last week. All he really did was spread some bull.

As the Miami Marlins exited Chicago with a 10-27 record on Thursday, they continued on a course of potentially historic futility. The Marlins are on pace to win 44 games. Since 1961, when Major League Baseball adopted the 162-game schedule, only three teams have won fewer than 50 games in a non-strike season.

The first was the lovably inept 1962 New York Mets, an expansion team that won only 40 games. The second was the 2003 Detroit Tigers, who won 43. Finally, the 2018 Baltimore Orioles won only 47. To add insult to that, the Marlins are on pace to be outscored by 345 runs for the season, which would be the worst margin ever.

As in forever. As in all of baseball history.

While there have been plenty of bad teams in the history of baseball, this Marlins team is special in one regard. Jeter, a man who undoubtedly will be elected to the Hall of Fame next year when he’s first eligible and who personified class on the field during his career with the New York Yankees, killed this team.

Jeter is the CEO and owns a four percent stake in the team. Despite that impressive title and share of the team, Jeter didn’t just kill the Marlins, he eviscerated this team. The Marlins not only have no present, their future looks awful as well. Jeter not only sent away four excellent-to-great players, he got almost nothing back for them.

That’s why it was almost galling to hear Jeter talk about how everyone in the organization should be unhappy and disappointed.

“We all have to improve, collectively,” Jeter said.

That’s tripe. Jeter is the one responsible for this mess and the brutal outlook. He put his name and his money behind this operation. Manager Don Mattingly didn’t trade away a bunch of good players to create this crapfest. Don’t blame guys like Isaac Galloway, Jon Berti and Pete O’Brien for a lineup that should be playing in Triple-A.

Don’t blame the overwhelming lack of talent in the farm system on anybody else, either. If Jeter wants to assess blame, the only finger he should be pointing is a thumb and poking it right into his chest.

The Marlins should have one of the best outfields in baseball. They had Giancarlo Stanton, Christian Yelich and Marcell Ozuna. That’s two guys who have won MVP awards and an middle-of-the-order power hitter. Yelich leads the National League with 16 home runs and Ozuna is tied for third with 11.

Their total of 27 is more than the Marlins (24) have as a team. Throw in the fact that the Marlins traded away catcher J.T. Realmuto and you have an exodus of talent that is stunning. With those four players and a couple of wise additions, the Marlins could be competitive.

But that’s not all folks.

Sure, some teams go through rebuilds. They trade away prime talent now to stock up with prospects. That’s modern sports and it can work, if you actually get prospects.

Of the 13 players the Marlins got for Stanton, Yelich, Ozuna and Realmuto, three are currently in the majors (pitcher Sandy Alcantara, journeyman infielder Starlin Castro and fading prospect catcher Jorge Alfaro). Only two others (pitcher Sixto Sanchez and outfielder Monte Harrison) are in the top 100 prospects as rated by MLB.com.

And Harrison, who comes in at No. 100, is a 23-year-old who struck out more than 200 times last season. In Double-A. His swing is better suited to be a ceiling fan in a Florida bungalow.

The rest of the group is either pure mediocrity or is being mismanaged. Outfielder Lewis Brinson,. the centerpiece of the Yelich deal, has been a bust so far. He has hit under .200 in parts of two seasons. Still, there’s no reason Brinson shouldn’t be in the majors when the Marlins wasting at-bats with the likes of Berti and Galloway, who are each 29, and Curtis Granderson, who is 38.

As the saying goes in sports, if you’re going to be bad, at least be young. Young guys just want to play and they’re mentally resilient. Of course, Jeter missed that lesson in team building during all his years playing for the always-contending Yankees. That’s probably why only two of the Miami’s everyday players is under 26 and none of them are under 25.

While some people will point to the Marlins rotation (Alcantara, Caleb Smith, Pablo Lopez and Trevor Richards) as a foundation, not one of those guys has ace potential. In fact, none of them may ever be better than a No. 3 pitcher on a good team.

What Jeter did was not only give away prime talent, he gave it away at bargain prices. He turned wine into water.",https://fansided.com/2019/05/10/derek-jeter-marlins-rebuild-failure/,2019-05-10T17:10:41Z,FanSided,"225 Liberty St., New York, NY 10281"
These idiots shot a porno in an Autopilot-enabled Tesla and Elon Musk deserves some blame,"Taylor Jackson is a pioneer, of sorts. The adult actress, to our knowledge, is the first to shoot a pornographic scene in a moving vehicle without a human driver. And much like other pioneers her actions will inspire some while leading others to reenact an event that could, quite possibly, end in death.

Jackson recently shot a pornographic scene where she and a man in the driver’s seat engaged in various sex acts while riding in a Tesla, on Autopilot.

As dumb as it was, Jackson isn’t the problem; Elon Musk is.

Look, we knew that people would fuck in self-driving cars. This is something we all saw coming (I haven’t decided if I intended on that being a pun or not yet) — including a group of researchers who published a report on the topic late last year.

And while we certainly look forward to boning in a car on the way to the company Christmas party, the truth of the matter is that autonomous technology isn’t anywhere near safe enough yet to allow for this kind of distraction.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk isn’t helping anyone to understand that. Naming the AI ‘Autopilot,’ for one, was an irresponsible choice, as Musk himself would tell you — and has, repeatedly — Tesla’s aren’t meant to be driven without input from a human driver.

Autopilot is meant to be an assistive measure, not the primary means of piloting a vehicle. Tesla reminds anyone curious about its Autopilot technology of exactly this on its website:

Autopilot is intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any time. While Autopilot is designed to become more capable over time, in its current form, it is not a self-driving system.

Using similar technology, a self-driving Uber killed a pedestrian late last year. Its driver was reportedly watching Hulu. Few would argue that watching The Handmaid’s Tale is safe while driving, but I think we’d all agree that its safer than a quickie at highway speeds. It’s not apples-to-apples, as the companies use different AIs to pilot these semi-autonomous vehicles. What matters is that none of the current vehicles on the road are safe enough to drive without human intervention.

Musk, though, continues to fuel this erroneous belief that they are. Not through words, but action.

In a 2019 60 minutes segment, Musk conducts an interview while behind the wheel of a Model 3. Journalist Leslie Stahl, at one point, remarks that the vehicle is operating itself without intervention from Musk.

This was an opportunity for Musk to explain Autopilot as a system that assists the driver, but instead he talked about how cool it was that the Model 3 could switch lanes on its own. He had a chance to educate, and instead used it as a means to advertise, as our own Tristan Greene pointed out. (This would have been a good time to talk about the Model 3’s classification as a Level 2 automated system, out of five, and how it needed frequent human intervention to be considered safe).

While Tesla Autopilot accidents are rare — rarer than those caused by human drivers, in fact — it’s irresponsible to assure the public in such a way that they place undue confidence in systems that are still, essentially, part of a grand beta testing experiment.

This is normally the point where a Tesla PR would reach out to remind me that there are visual and audible reminders for drivers to take control of the vehicle before accidents. To which I’d remind them that one of these incidents, a 2016 crash in Florida that killed a man, the audible cues, according to Tesla, gave the man six-seconds to react to the collision — take this with a grain of salt, as it comes from Tesla itself, which certainly has a motive to direct blame at the driver of the vehicle.

As for Jackson, the performer involved in the Autopilot sex act, are we to assume that she could dismount her sex partner and return to her seat within that time? Is it possible? Maybe. But that’s not the only dangerous part of the encounter. Tesla’s Autopilot system can be disengaged when a human applies force to the steering wheel — a distinct possibility when banging in the driver’s seat.

It’s unlikely Tesla would condone this type of behavior, but it’s worth noting.

As for Musk, he’s remained mum about the video, which was trending in certain corners of the internet this week, and on Pornhub itself. He did, however, recently remind investors that self-driving capabilities would be safe enough for passengers to remove their hands from the wheel by the end of next year.

If that’s the case, maybe Musk’s 60 minutes interview, and Jackson’s romp on the freeway, appear to have come a bit early (Okay, that one is definitely a pun.)

Tesla has yet to respond to our request for comment.

DCA: No 'jurisdiction' over admittance of confession in Segura murder case,"CLOSE Henry Segura takes the stand in his own defense during the quadruple murder trial on Aug. 11, 2017.

An appeals court ruled it doesn’t have the authority to require a gang members' claim he is responsible for a 2010 quadruple murder to be allowed at the trial of the man accused of the crime.

In an opinion released Tuesday, the First District Court of Appeal wrote it did not have the jurisdiction over what evidence could and couldn’t be used in Henry Segura's upcoming trial.

The DCA dismissed the petition by Segura's attorneys to force the Second Judicial Circuit to allow the odd testimony of James Carlos Santos that he, from federal prison, ordered the murders Segura is charged with committing.

Segura, 40, has sat through 12 trial delays and one mistrial on charges he was responsible for the brutal November 2010 killing of his girlfriend Brandi Peters, her twin daughters, Tamiyah and Taniyah Peters, and their 3-year-old son JaVonte Segura.

He has remained in the Leon County Detention Facility for 2,765 days since his arrest in 2011. He was set to stand trial last month but the case was continued.

On the eve of Segura’s first trial in August, Santos claimed Peters was killed in a drug cartel hit that he orchestrated.

A series of threatening emails exchanged between Peters and Santos in the days before she was killed show she was concerned about her involvement with Santos, the Chicago-based gang, the Vice Lords, and the Los Zetas cartel, according to Segura’s attorney Nathan Prince and Santos’ testimony. Peters is purported to have been running Colombian cocaine for the Mexican cartel and skimmed close to $90,000 of her loads.

With Santos’ testimony, Segura could be acquitted. Without it, he likely faces another mistrial, one of his attorneys Michael Ufferman contended.

The DCA judges agreed the particulars of the case warranted a closer look, but could not rule on the potential impact of the evidence.

“Segura’s circumstances are indeed unusual,” the judges found. “But none grants us jurisdiction for the pre-trial review of disputed evidentiary issues. Neither pretrial detention nor the possibility of another mistrial constitutes the type of irreparable harm necessary (to support allowing the evidence.)”

Prosecutors allege Segura killed Peters and the children to avoid paying more than $20,000 in back child support.

Santos invoked his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination at Segura’s first trial and did not take the stand. In letters sent to Leon Circuit Judge James C. Hankinson that have been filed in court records, Santos has expressed interest in testifying at Segura’s next trial.

PARKER COUNTY, Texas -

A Texas man discovered a human femur bone that is believed to be nearly 800 years old, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.

>> Read more trending news

Parker County resident Scott Fuller was fishing along the Brazos River on March 22 when he saw the bone floating about a foot from shore, according to WFAA.

""I'm still wrapping my mind around it,"" Fuller told the television station. ""I thought this could be a drowning, this could be a murder mystery.”

It was neither. The bone was identified and tested by a forensic anthropologist, Bryan Wright, an investigator in Parker County, told the Weatherford Democrat.

“She realized that the bone was probably ancient and took a sample to a lab in Florida, and they did a carbon-14 dating on it and it came back to be about 800 years old,” Wright told the newspaper.

The bone belonged to someone who died between 1286 and 1398, the forensic anthropologist said.

“The carbon-14 date shows the bone to be from 1286 to 1398 A.D. with a 95.4 percent accuracy,” Wright told the Democrat. “So the Indian that that bone belonged to was here before (Christopher) Columbus discovered North America. It was 200 years before that, even.”

Parker County Sheriff Larry Fowler told the newspaper the bone likely belonged to a Caddo Indian.

Now, Fuller is wondering who the person was.

""Just every thought goes through my mind,"" Fuller told WFAA. ""I would just love to hear from them. I'd love to talk to them and learn more.”

Armed detention deputy accused in road rage incident in Florida Keys,"Jatavi Wendall Lee told deputies that he was running late for work at the Stock Island jail.

KEY LARGO, Fla. - A Monroe County detention deputy was arrested Tuesday after authorities said he drove erratically, nearly causing multiple collisions, and then berated one of the drivers while armed and in uniform.

Jatavi Wendall Lee, 35, of Miami, faces charges of reckless driving and obstructing a highway.

Adam Linhardt, a spokesman for the Monroe County Sheriff's Office, said the incident happened March 29 when Lee was driving along the Overseas Highway in Key Largo.

A motorist who witnessed Lee's reckless driving contacted the Monroe County Sheriff's Office and provided deputies with video of the incident from his dashboard camera, Linhardt said.

Witnesses told deputies that Lee was driving at high rate of speed and weaving in and out of lanes. Linhardt said Lee almost caused two collisions with his erratic maneuvers.

At one point, Lee, while driving an unmarked black car, illegally passed a white pickup truck, Linhardt said. After Lee passed the truck, he abruptly stopped, causing drivers behind him to slam on their brakes to avoid a crash, deputies said. Lee then got out of the car and shouted obscenities at the driver of the pickup truck, witnesses said.

Wearing a Sheriff's Office uniform and gun belt, Lee told the truck driver to “never do that again,” saying the truck driver didn't know where he was going, Lindhardt said.

The truck driver, a retired firefighter, said he did not report incident out of respect for law enforcement, but once he was contacted by deputies he corroborated the account of the man with the dashboard camera. The truck driver said Lee did not use any police lights during the stop. Linhardt added that as a detention deputy, Lee was not authorized to make traffic stops.

When questioned by deputies, Lee said he was running late for work at the Stock Island jail and admitted to driving erratically and stopping traffic.

At the time of the incident, Linhardt said Lee, who was hired as a detention deputy in 2017, was on probation in Miami-Dade County after he pleaded no contest to domestic battery and theft of a license plate tag in 2018.

According to Miami Gardens police, Lee slapped the mother of one of his children across the face when he ran into her and her new boyfriend at his child's day care center. He then followed the woman to a nearby gas station, where he stole the woman's license plate and threatened to shoot the couple, police said.

In 2009, Lee was accused of battery against the same woman.

The Monroe County Sheriff's Office has started the process to terminate Lee. He will have a hearing to determine whether he will be terminated on May 13. In the meantime, Lee has been placed on leave without pay and ordered to turn in his badge and uniform.

""I take these incidents very seriously,"" Sheriff Rick Ramsay said in a statement. ""I expect the highest level of professional conduct from Sheriff's Office staff. This type of behavior will never be tolerated under my leadership as reflected in the actions we have taken.""

The man said he had to fall off his bike to avoid a possible life-threatening injury.

""I'm lucky to walk away. It's just scary to think that something like that is out here,"" the man said.

""He could have gone right through it, and it could have taken his head off in all reality,"" his girlfriend added.

""It was burning, like somebody was like, taking fishing wire or something like that trying to decapitate me the whole time,"" he said.

The man and his girlfriend asked not to be identified since they ride bikes in Central Park almost daily and fear reprisal for sounding the alarm.

Where’s The Worst Place On Your Body To Put Your Sunglasses When You’re Not Wearing Them?,"Graphic: Elena Scotti (GMG), Photo: Getty

Funbag Time for your weekly edition of the Deadspin Funbag. Got something on your mind? [Email the Funbag](mailto:funbag.deadspin@gmail.com).

Today, we’re talking about old man farts, parking apps, Florida, road trips, cupcakes, and more.



Your letters:

Adam:

If you were to rank the best place on your body to hold your sunglasses when not wearing them, from least douchey to most douchey, what would it be? My ranking is: LEAST TO MOST: 1) Brim of your hat (if you’re wearing one) 2) Hanging from the neck of your shirt 3) Top of your head (no hat on) 4) Back of your head or neck 5) On your forehead I can perfectly picture any cast member from Jersey Shore doing #4 and #5. I think only 1-3 are acceptable in normal society. What say you?

I hang mine from the neck of my shirt UNLESS I happen to have a breast pocket handy, like on a dress shirt or a polo shirt. Then I keep those sunglasses right next to my manboob. Drives the ladies WILD. It’s also convenient and eliminates the risk of a hinge on one of the temples grabbing a stray chest hair and somehow ripping it out (this has happened to me!). If it makes me look like a dipshit, well, my face has already made preventing that impossible regardless. I prize convenience over looks, which is why I’m wearing pilled-up track pants as we speak. If you saw me right now, you’d cross the avenue to avoid coming within a five-yard radius of me. Here’s how I would rank them:

LEAST TO MOST:

1) Top of the head/hat

2) Neck of your shirt

3) Tucked into breast pocket

4) Tucked into cargo shorts pocket… HELL YEAH

5) Forehead. Somehow my forehead is too flat to make this possible for me

6) Tucked into your waistband. Like a six-shooter, baby.

7) Hanging from CROAKIES. So cool! Very modern look. I told you I’m a slave to practicality and yet even I wouldn’t dare to wear Croakies: the beer coozie of sunglass storage. That’ll change if I ever own a speedboat.

8) Back of the head. I’m not lying when I tell you I had never done this. I tried it just now and it feels weird. That’s not where glasses go, man. Please remand this entry to the very bottom of the list if your sunglasses are also upside-down back there, like you think your head is a convertible.

9) On top of a VISOR. What is a visor, really, but a shelf for knockoff Oakleys? Some visors ARE sunglasses, which is just the sharpest look. If you ever want to be mistaken for a Sarasota tennis instructor, this is your look.

Steve:

I live in a suburb of Boston and we’ve recently changed the T Station parking lots to be entirely pay by phone. Who does this benefit?!? I now have to log into an app, log my license plate, location, anticipated length of stay, and pay by card in an app. It’s too smart by half. If Google can’t protect our info I definitely trust some shady parking app to hold and protect my credit card. We’ve reached a point where technology is now less convenient because someone at City Hall wants to seem smart. The future is so fucking stupid.

That happened to me in D.C. once. I parked in a public garage before a concert, scanned around like an old fart for a meter to feed, and then discovered a sign telling me I had to download ParkMobile. So there I was, out on the town, standing in the middle of some shitty garage with bad reception, waiting for an app to load. In theory, I guess this is “easier” than waiting at a gate for a ticket and then paying on the way out at a Park-And-Pay kiosk that never works. And it’s “easier” than feeding meters with a credit card, or from a supply of quarters stashed in my car’s console that will prove inadequate at the least opportune times. In practice, it’s yet another example of people taking technology that purports to make things more efficient but makes them clumsy and annoying instead. It’s like instant replay. I assume ParkMobile is ALSO a social network, where you can friend other parking enthusiasts and star your favorite garages for scoring crack. FUN.

I’m too old and lazy to reorient my parking habits to this new model. Every day I get one step closer to becoming Ron Swanson. I am in a cranky purgatory where I am suspicious of wonky tech and even MORE suspicious of tech that works seamlessly, with barely any glitches at all. Apple keeps wanting me to set up Apple Pay and I’d rather die. They probably monitor your blood sugar levels when you use it. I don’t want some fucking app to know my license plate number, much less one run by a Mike Judge side character:

“This a true validation of our vision for smart mobility and our success in delivering innovation to the market. Today, over 350 municipalities and thousands of private garages, venues and airports have adopted the ParkMobile platform. With 1 in 20 drivers in the U.S. having the ParkMobile app on their mobile device, we are getting closer to realizing our vision of powering dynamic mobility solutions for cities and operators everywhere.”

“Dynamic mobility solutions.” Man, fuck you. You’re a digital meter maid. This guy is gonna sell your car’s information and your entire driving history to the Toyota lady and she will appear, in person, at your house and knock on your window, grinning like a maniac, to sell you an extended bumper-to-bumper warranty. Please god, no. The grid doesn’t get to have ALL my shit. Some shit I need to keep for myself. If that means getting a quarter stuck in a stupid meter every once in a while, I can live with that.

Everything that should be paperless isn’t and everything that shouldn’t be paperless now is. It’s a goddamn mess. The entire health insurance industry here is still built around FAXING things. And what if you can’t afford a fucking smartphone to park with, or you just don’t have one? I wanna die. If you need me, I’ll be in my basement tinkering with a ham radio.

Matt:

Has Johnny Depp ever made a good movie? I submit to you that the answer is no.

You’re thinking of Angelina Jolie. HEY-OOOOOOOOOOOO. For real though, I don’t agree with that takeage. I’ve seen Johnny Depp in a lot of good movies: Donnie Brasco, Edward Scissorhands, the first Pirates movie, Platoon (he’s in it for a solid 40 seconds!), From Hell, and more. He’s an actor, so he’s invariably got some blight on his imdb page, especially since he’s a card-carrying loon who fancies himself a Serious Artist. He almost certainly has had an entire movie set rolling their eyes as he tests out a Foghorn Leghorn accent for the role of a sitting 19th-century President.

I would tell you that Johnny Depp is such a train wreck now, including being at the center of an ugly legal tussle over accusations of domestic assault, which had people pissed about him getting cast in Fantastical Hippogriffs 4: Dobby Lobby, that he may never headline a good movie again. But I know better. I know he’ll stage a branded comeback that includes a star turn in Tim Burton’s reimagining of Green Eggs and Ham (Depp will play the eggs; it’ll make $2 billion), and then he’ll get a mandatory Oscar for playing e e cummings in Busy Monster, as directed by Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. Entertainment Weekly will take a week off from liberal cheerleading to do their obligatory handiwork for L.A. publicists and put him on the cover with the headline THIS DEAD MAN HAS A TALE TO TELL. After that, Depp will settle into a latter-day career of for-hire work in action schlock to help pay off all his monstrous debt. It’ll be like Robert De Niro’s current filmography, only with more scarves and thumb rings. That’s all coming. You can set your watch to it.

He really is (was?) a good actor, though. It’s not like seeing Rob Schneider’s name on a marquee and instinctively knowing that you’re in for 87 minutes of pure shit that they filmed in between extended margarita breaks. The man made some enjoyable movies. Arizona Dream was not one of them. I am like other people in that I have acting nemeses whose presence in a film makes me WANT to hate it. If Depp is one of yours, I understand. But I’ll save my skepticism for Taylor Lautner movies instead, provided Taylor Lautner is still among the living.

Would you rather be the only person on earth who knew and could reproduce the entire catalog of Lennon/McCartney/Harrison or would you rather be the only person on earth who knew and could reproduce the entire works of Shakespeare?

I’m so fucked in the head that I immediately framed this question in terms of money. As in: which choice would make me richer? The answer, of course, is that neither option would make me a billionaire. Even if I were talented enough to recreate the plot of the upcoming movie Yesterday in real life, no one would give a shit. I’ve met the modern internet. People are online all the time being like ACTUALLY THE BEATLES WERE TRASH and acting like that’s a new opinion. You’re telling me you don’t like music that’s decades old? I’m stunned, I am. That’s so unlike young people.

So I’d get my ass handed to me. The Beatles showed up at the precisely right time for The Beatles to show up. If they showed up now, they’d get relegated to the second stage of Coachella and forced to open for Liver Diary. So if I were The Beatles, I’d be crooning “The Night Before” to a bunch of shit-high 20-somethings all dying for a bottle of water. That’s if I were lucky. And if I reproduced Shakespeare word for word, nobody would buy it, let alone publish it. Every written play of mine would be outsold by Kellyanne Conway’s Badass Woman Of Washington. If I ever managed to get a production funded, it would close after two weeks and get replaced with an Aaron Sorkin one-man play about the life of Dan Rather.

However, that’s the wrong way to think about all this. I do support doing creative shit for money. It’s how I earn a living at the present moment, until my employers realize they’ve been throwing that money down a trash chute. But to be the sole vessel and custodian of one of mankind’s most vital artistic entities, and either choice counts as one, would be a fucking HUGE responsibility. It’s not a thing where I’m gonna succeed or be happy trying to present myself as a credible, expensive impostor for either one. It would be better (Communist voice) to spend my life IN those works and championing them, even to deaf ears. I would pick Shakespeare and then I would become so obsessive over preserving his works, while insisting that I was not the originator of them, that they would lock me up in a loony bin within a matter of months. You don’t understand! I come from an alternate past! What are those shock paddles for?!

My kid had to read Shakespeare’s sonnets in seventh grade. Her teacher gave the class a bunch of the poems printed out on a worksheet to take home, and when I read them, I was happy. They were gorgeous. I became like other people who are so transfixed by timeless works of art that they can feel their internal chemistry change at the sight of it. That’s worth more than drawing up some fucking business plan to make Shakespeare an app. I think. Okay, it’s probably not, but still. I’m gonna go read more of those sonnets and just be happy.

Justin:

Why do people live in Florida?

I shit on Florida all the time because it’s a swamp full of insane people, but even I know that it’s easy to make a case for the state as a whole. You know it’s warm in Florida, right? Hurricanes be damned, the weather there makes Florida infinitely more pleasant than, like, Indiana. If you’re gonna live in a shithole, at least live in a sunny one. I’ve caught Florida on the right day, feeling the gentle breeze and standing among the swaying palms staring out into in the shimmering Atlantic, and I have felt like a complete idiot for not living there. It beckons to people. It’s warm. It has great food. It has no state income taxes. Swept clean of America’s horseshit, it’s paradise.

The bitter irony is that Florida sells itself so well that it has attracted more than enough people to fucking ruin it, so much so that it’s somehow now reasonable for you to be like, “Ugh, Florida… who would want to live THERE?” We (and by “we,” I mean people other than me) should fix Florida so that it’s pristine again. Drive out all the old people and racist sheriffs. Drive out Derek Jeter. Throw all the fucking guns into Lake Okeechobee. FIND THAT DAMN FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH. Florida has too much going for it to end its lifespan as a glorified dog track.

HALFTIME!

David:

How did people plan road trips before the internet? How would you know where you should stop if there was no Yelp to recommend it?

Advertisement

You just ate at McDonald’s like everyone else did. The road planned your meals for you. When you got hungry, you stopped where it told you to stop. I am still lacking in ambition when it comes to road food. I just wanna stop and eat and piss quickly, and not lose precious time before arriving at my relatives’ house to stare at the wall. If that means I don’t get to enjoy a lunch of perfectly arranged charcuterie and hearth-made flatbreads on the way to Crested Butte, I’ll survive. The road is the worst place to be picky. There could be a free meal at Husk awaiting me en route and if it’s two miles off the highway, I’m not stopping. Fuck that. Once I start the trip, I want to end it. I demand efficiency.

So when it comes to planning road trips now, about the only difference in my process from back in the day was that I can use Google Maps, check the route beforehand, and then worry that the route Google Lady has chosen will either have a shitload of traffic when I use it, or that she’ll try to divert me from traffic by having me drive over Mount Rainier or through a day care center. That’s definitely an improvement from me forcing whoever’s riding shotgun to eyebang an atlas and then yelling at them because they can’t read the fucking thing properly. But it’s still not a fully optimized road trip experience. Maybe ParkMobile can think of a more dynamic mobility solution.

By the way, back before smartphones, we would print out directions using MapQuest. Remember MapQuest? We all loved MapQuest, did we not? I used to use MapQuest, and then I upgraded to a Garmin, because I adopt new technology at roughly the same rate and canniness of the President. God man, this Funbag has aged me by 90 years. This is all because I got fitted for hearing aids last week. I feel so old, man. Anyway, road trips are still as long and annoying as they’ve always been, and you won’t ever catch me going the full Kerouac when talking about them.

Nick:

Earlier this year, I was at an MLS match sitting in the family section. I stood up to cheer and was immediately and rudely told by a fellow fan to sit down or “go sit in the other section” (supporters’ area behind the nets). I sat down dejected and felt like I would have been justified starting an argument or perhaps throwing a well-timed and simple curse at the man. I mean, it is live sports after all! Furthermore, my girlfriend was with me and I felt judged by her for backing down so easily, although she did say I “made the right call.” Should I have said something?

I would say yes, except that I wouldn’t have the temerity to say anything either. Like you, I would sit down then just seethe about it instead, like a chump. I’m of the mind that you should expect mass standing to be extremely prevalent when you go to a sporting event, especially if it’s a critical matchup. This isn’t particularly fair to kids, nor to short people, nor to the elderly, but I just figured that standing was now widely tolerated outside of Lambeau Field, where old cusses will smack you with a cane if you scream DE-FENSE too loud.

I took my son to a Skins game last fall and quickly realized the whole section was gonna stand for the entire game. I know it’s hard to believe a crowd in Landover would be actually excited for a home game, but it’s true. Only time the fans sat was when Alex Smith broke his leg. After that, they were right back on their feet with COLT MC-COY chants. My son had to stand on his seat to make out any of the action, but neither he nor I bitched people out about it. It was just how it was, and I wasn’t in the mood to instigate some shit with acolytes of the Dead Tree Crew. I am firmly of the mind that, unless standing causes serious physical problems, you just do as your section does. It’ll usually make the right choice: sitting for regular season baseball but standing for college football, etc. It’s an improvised sociological experiment and I almost always fall in line with the majority on it, even when that majority is comprised of a bunch of Taylors from Olney who only speak remedial Junkies-ese.

It’s apparently not on Youtube, but when I was a kid, the NFL ran a PSA telling fans to sit down during games. The ad opens up with people at a Bills game sitting and enjoying the K-Gun offense in action, until some drunken asshole—you know, a Bills fan—stumbles in and stands up the whole game to cheer. Then the whole section shouts him down by singing “Sit down! Sit down, don’t rock the boat!” Then they cut to Jim Kelly telling you to sit there during games and to please not rock the boat. I swear this ad existed, and it was as dated then as it is now.

If you are sitting in what is formally designated a family section—with scores of kids and babies wearing construction ear muffs and shit—then I understand why people would want you to sit. They shouldn’t be cocks about it, though I expect nothing less from pampered mommies and daddies. Outside of that, people shouldn’t be shocked if they discover that they don’t get to spend the game on their asses. In the future, teams will sell Personal Butt Licenses and charge you extra for a seat located in a loge-level box that’s Sitting Only. But until then, wear comfortable shoes.

Eddie:

So the other day my nephew who went to a kids party handed me a cupcake shaped as a 1.5"" cube (Minecraft themed) and it was so easy to eat, tasted good all around, not like the usual cupcakes where the bottom part is underwhelming and you have to remove the liner. It was such a revelation, cupcakes should be cube shaped ALWAYS!

I’m fine with making that an iron law, but really the issue with cupcakes is more the size than the shape. A mini-cupcake is much easier to eat than a full-size one, where you gotta unlock your jaw like you’re a crocodile just to accommodate a bite that has a proper ratio of cake and frosting. A BIG cube cupcake would be just as cumbersome as a round one. Plus, a bigger cupcake means more cake part and really, the cake part isn’t the main attraction for me. I just want frosting delivered into my body with a minimum of fuss. If that means eating more Minecraft cupcakes, I’m fine with that so long as Notch doesn’t get any more royalties from my purchase, because he sucks.

By the way, one old foodhack is to remove the bottom of a cupcake, stick it on top of the frosting, and eat the thing like it’s a whoopie pie. I have tried this method. I was dying to like it, it seemed so smart. But what happens is that you get bukkaked in crumbs, and then all of the tasty frosting gets tucked between two stumps of dryass cake. There’s a reason layer cakes also have frosting on top, you know. They don’t just leave the top barren. Eating a cupcake sandwich is like eating a cake that a baker forgot to finish. I’m crestfallen. From now, I’m only buying cupcakes from Hostess.

Maddie:

Now that we’ve got openers in baseball, will we start tracking opens like we do saves? I’ve been at multiple White Sox games this year where Lucas Giolito gave up a grand slam in the first inning. Would an opener have prevented this and my suffering?

Advertisement

No, because you’re a White Sox fan and they’re fucking terrible no matter what they do (RIP Marchman). Anyway, you will not see “tables set” ever become an official baseball stat. I KNOW ME SOME BASEBAW. For real though, 64 years passed between the first time a manager first used relief pitching and the sport recognizing saves as an official stat. So even if baseball adopted some way of measuring “cold opens” for pitchers, the world will be on fire by the time they do it.

Secondly, saves are a fucking horrible stat. Both nerdy stat nerds AND Phil Mushnick agree on this take. They’re a shitty way of gauging effective relief pitching. And given the impact that sabremetrics has already made on the sport, MLB would either forgo an official stat for openers, or they would devise an inscrutable-but-more-accurate stat that old sportswriters would then immediately bitch about. Fire Joe Morgan no longer exists but old timers being like, “These pencilnecks with their BUMBO stats ain’t ever stepped up on the mound!” will never go out of fashion.

A few more things while I’m pulling insights out of my ass. If you’re gonna have both closers AND openers, you may as well make every game a committee effort, as the Rays have attempted in the past. If that happens, there’s no real point in tallying save-type stats based on whatever innings a pitcher happens to work, because every inning is equally important. That’s why saves are dumb. That’s why wins and losses are also dumb. Any simplistic new stat they might devise would strictly be a marketing ploy, an easy number for to you to look at on a baseball card.

Advertisement

Regardless, starters will probably never go extinct. Everyone in the sport is too accustomed to them, and professional pitchers have been trained and molded for the work. Some guys thrive in short relief. Other guys are warhorses who need multiple innings to get into a rhythm and establish command. Even though the Rays won 90 games last year, it would still take years and years for the entire sport to rework itself around a new pitching model. And if there’s one thing baseball loves, it’s change! They’re super into change. NO ONE DENIES THIS.

At my small, local gym, an older gentleman usually comes in while I am on the treadmill. First thing he does is close the windows that were slightly opened, which cuts off air flow in the gym. Second thing he does is get on the only other treadmill right next to me, begin his jog, and start farting. Nasty, old man farts. He has done this for the last three occasions where we have been in the gym at the same time. My question is, what gives? Do I say something? It’s kind of hard to run while inhaling old man farts.

CHESAPEAKE, Va. (WAVY) -- A woman charged in connection to man's murder in Chesapeake was found guilty following a trial that ended on Monday.

Court records show Darrius Copeland was convicted of first-degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony in connection to the August 2016 death of Timothy Crosky.

Chesapeake Police said Crosky was shot at his home on Bell Tower Arch in Chesapeake. Responding officers found the 25-year-old man lying on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds.

Crosky was later pronounced dead at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.

Copeland and her sister, Dequashia Copeland, were arrested two weeks later in Jacksonville, Florida.

Dequashia Copeland was found not guilty of all charges in a jury trial that ended on May 3.

A sentencing hearing for Darrius Copeland was set for Sept. 9.",http://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/chesapeake/woman-convicted-of-murder-in-2016-chesapeake-homicide/1986479238,2019-05-07T18:05:31Z,WAVY,"300 Wavy St, Portsmouth, VA 23704, USA"
Court: Homeowner should get new trial in unarmed man's death,"RALEIGH — A white homeowner who fatally shot an unarmed black man after reporting ""hoodlums"" in his neighborhood should get a new trial because the prosecutor gratuitously injected race in his closing argument, North Carolina's second-highest court ruled Tuesday.

In the split 2-1 decision, the panel of the state Court of Appeals ruled that Raleigh resident Chad Copley, 42, deserves another trial in the August 2016 shooting death of Kouren Thomas, 20. Copley was convicted last year of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison for shooting.

Thomas was leaving a nearby house party when Copley fired a shotgun blast from inside his garage. Copley had testified that he feared for his family's safety after seeing men display guns while leaving the party. Witnesses testified at Copley's trial that Thomas was unarmed, and prosecutors told jurors that no gun was found where Thomas fell to the ground.

Under cross-examination, Copley acknowledged that he lied to police nearly a dozen times, including false accounts of people racing on his small residential street and vandalizing property and saying he fired a warning shot before killing Thomas.

An attorney for the victim's family describes Thomas as ""George Zimmerman 2.0,"" referring to the ex-neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida who fatally shot unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin 2012. Zimmerman, who identifies as Hispanic, was acquitted on grounds of self-defense in the shooting in Sanford, Florida.

Although the prosecutor, Patrick Latour, said in closing arguments that evidence showed Copley was ""scared of these black males,"" no such evidence was presented to the jury, the state Court of Appeals ruled. It said the only evidence about race presented at trial was that members of the group outside Copley's home had told him to ""go inside, white boy"" after he shouted at them to be quiet.

The decision didn't name Latour, who tried the case as assistant district attorney in Wake County.

Judge John Tyson wrote in Tuesday's decision, with which Judge Donna Stroud concurred, that ""race was irrelevant in the case. There's no connection between the ""white boy"" remark ""and the invidious inference that defendant held an irrational fear or exhibited hatred of Thomas and other black partygoers to allow this closing argument,"" the opinion states. ""The prosecutor's remarks are a wholly gratuitous injection of race into the trial and were improper.""

When Copley's attorney objected at trial to the prosecutor's closing argument, Superior Court Judge Michael O'Foghludha overruled him.

On the 911 call, Copley said he had only fired a warning shot and said: ""There's frigging black males outside my frigging house with firearms. Please send PD.""

""I am locked and loaded,"" he said on the call. ""I'm going outside to secure my neighborhood.""

Copley testified during his trial that he would refer to his own son as a ""hoodlum.""

In his dissent, Judge John Arrowood wrote that the trial judge didn't err in allowing the closing argument because of the facts of the case, which showed ""a long, agitated white defendant threatened a large group of black individuals"" and that Copley alleged they referred to him ""as a 'white boy,' then hid and waited, eventually shooting a young black man who entered the area along the curb of his yard.""

A spokeswoman said the state attorney general's office is reviewing the decision, which can be appealed to the state Supreme Court.

South Carolina Rep. Justin Bamberg, an attorney representing Thomas' family, said the family disagrees with the decision but will trust the process. ""At the end of the day, Mr. Copley operated as if he were George Zimmerman 2.0, and he killed a young man who had not done anything wrong, who didn't deserve to die,"" Bamberg said.

Bamberg thanked the Wake County district attorney for ""pursuing these charges when, in lot of parts of the country, the district attorneys wouldn't have the grit to do it.""

Defense attorney Marilyn Ozer, who is representing Copley on appeal, said the appeals court decision was correct because ""prosecutors have a duty beyond the case. They have a duty to seek justice. In this case, playing the racial card in closing arguments was not warranted by the evidence.""",https://www.blueridgenow.com/news/20190507/court-homeowner-should-get-new-trial-in-unarmed-mans-death/1?rssfeed=true,2019-05-07T17:52:45Z,Hendersonville Times,"106 Henderson Crossing Plaza, Hendersonville, NC 28792, USA"

Emotional 911 calls released in shootout that killed 7-year-old girl,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The State Attorney's Office on Monday released audio of 911 calls made moments after a shootout that killed a 7-year-old girl in August.

Heidy Rivas Villanueva was caught in the crossfire that unfolded in the parking lot of a Westside strip mall after a botched robbery, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office. Heidy was shot in the head and did not survive.

Editor's Note: This story contains graphic details that some may find upsetting.

People nearby called 911 for help. One caller said they saw her father carrying the girl's body and screaming.

""Lord have mercy. I'm on 103rd (Street). I just heard some gunshots in the parking lot. I don't know what happened. But I saw this man go in the car, it look like he grabbed his child. They're gonna have to send the police out here,"" one 911 caller can be heard saying.

Later in that call, a 911 operator asks, ""Do you know if that child was shot?""

""It seemed like it. He was just holding her. She seemed lifeless. He was holding her and just running and screaming, running and screaming,"" the caller replies.

Another person also called 911 to report the shooting on 103rd Street.

Operator: ""You said someone's been shot?""

Caller: ""Yeah. There's a kid that's been shot. There was a shooting.""

Police said Trevonte Phoenix and Abrion Price had arranged a gun sale near the strip mall, but had actually planned to rob the buyer. They ended up trading gunfire with Stanley Harris, a friend of the buyer, police said.

Investigators said a bullet from Harris' gun struck Heidy, killing her. Because police said Phoenix and Price were committing a crime when Heidy was killed, they were each charged with felony murder, under Florida law. Harris is charged with third-degree murder.

Phoenix pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last month. Before that, a fourth man, Edward Garcia, who was charged as a getaway driver, pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to a first-degree felony. Both are awaiting sentencing.

Price and Harris have pleaded not guilty to their charges. They are awaiting trial.

TAMPA (WFLA) - In the world of fast food, there are a lot of players. But Chick-fil-A is a restaurant on a roll.

Gus Mir is a man who got in on the ground level. He opened his first Chick-fil-A restaurant at 22 years old in Pinellas County.

Mir would go on to open another restaurant years later. Little did he know that Chick-fil-A would explode in popularity.

""Well, we've experienced really unprecedented growth for our company,"" he said. ""The cornerstones are just a great restaurant experience, great quality, served by great people.""

Chick-fil-A could become the 3rd largest fast food chain in America in sales within the year, according to several reports.

So, as you can imagine, many want a piece of the action.

And while the cost to become a franchisee isn't too excessive, there is something that may stand in the way of someone opening one of the coveted locations.

""It's very competitive. Sometimes it's harder to get into the C.F.A (Chick-fil-A), than the C.I.A because of their selection standards,"" he said.

But once a new location goes up, look out. These restaurants operate at an intense level of speed to help meet the demand of hungry customers.

""We're serving about 140 guests in the drive-through in one of our peak hours,"" he told us. ""That's a car at the window every 24 seconds.""",https://www.wfla.com/8-on-your-side/bay-area-man-talks-about-secrets-to-running-a-successful-business/1984131808,2019-05-06T22:16:45Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"
Daytona Beach man accused of beating 3-year-old because she soiled herself,"Daytona Beach man accused of beating 3-year-old because she soiled herself

A Daytona Beach man is accused of repeatedly hitting a 3-year-old developmentally delayed child with a cell phone charger cord because she soiled herself. Johnathon Wheeler, 30, was arrested Sunday on a child abuse warrant out of Orange City. Orange City Police Department officials said Wheeler was at a fast-food restaurant last week when he took the child to the family van to discipline her and change her. Police said Wheeler told them he hit the child six or seven times, but according to medical staff who examined the child, she had 15 to 20 injuries that left marks and bruises around the front and back of her groin area and abdomen. The injuries were discovered by staff at the child's school.

Deliberations in the case of an East Naples man accused of impaired driving and killing a woman in a 2014 crash began at the Collier County Courthouse Monday.

Kiereek Seymour, 29, of East Naples, was charged with DUI manslaughter after an early morning crash at Lakewood and Davis boulevards in East Naples on May 19, 2014.

Sandra Marie Maddux, 54, of East Naples, died from injuries suffered in the crash.

Collier Circuit Judge Joseph Foster declared a mistrial in the case in February after a juror came out of the jury room during deliberations and indicated she was feeling uncomfortable.

Jurors began deliberations around 4:30 p.m. Monday after the new trial began on April 22.

The trial included conflicting assertions about whether Seymour was driving the Jaguar, who was at fault in the crash and whether Seymour's blood-alcohol content was above 0.08, the legal limit for driving.

Assistant State Attorney Mara Marzano began her closing argument by telling the jurors that Maddux lost her life because Seymour was driving impaired due to the alcohol and alprazolam he had in his system at the time of the crash.

While Defense Attorney Peter Adrien said the state had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Seymour was driving the vehicle, was actually impaired or was at fault in the crash that killed Maddux.

Witness testimony proved Seymour was driving the vehicle involved in the crash with Maddux, Marzano said.

""There was never anyone else there,” Marzano said. “There was never any possibility that anyone else got out of that car and ran away.”

Seymour was found by witnesses positioned on the passenger side of the vehicle after the crash and it’s not the defense’s burden to prove who, if it wasn’t Seymour, was driving the vehicle, Adrien said.

Evidence collected by officers from the Florida Highway Patrol showed that Seymour was speeding and driving at least 62 mph at the time of the crash, while Maddux was driving 18 mph, Marzano said.

Adrien told the jurors the investigation by Florida Highway Patrol officers was not done properly and the speeds of the vehicles involved in the crash changed in various versions of the crash report.

Witness testimony also showed that Seymour had a yellow traffic signal and Maddux a red traffic signal, Adrien said.

In addition, Adrien said Maddux’s car had no lights on after the crash. Maddux could have been driving the dark vehicle at night with no lights, which could have contributed to the crash, he said.

However, Seymour’s slurred speech and medical records from the hospital after the crash prove he was impaired, Marzano told the jurors.

“Nowhere here does it say we have to prove he was falling down drunk,” Marzano said.

Seymour admitted to an emergency responder that he had a consumed one and a half beers before the crash and hospital staff recorded Seymour as clinically intoxicated and high, Marzano said.

The additive effect of alprazolam and alcohol impaired Seymour, Marzano said.

“I told you this was a complicated matter,” Marzano said. “I would suggest to you when you pare it down to what is real and not real you will find the defendant guilty.""

Adrien said none of the testing or evidence presented by the state proved that Seymour was over the 0.08 blood-alcohol level limit.

""The defendant is not guilty and this was a horrible accident,” Adrien said. “How could he be? He was following all the traffic rules.”

Even before February’s mistrial, Seymour had been in court before to face charges related to the crash that killed Maddux.

The state attorney's office refiled the DUI manslaughter charge in 2016 after then-Collier Circuit Judge Fred Hardt vacated an earlier plea agreement.

The negotiated plea agreement related to charges stemming from a Marco Island crash and charges from the crash involving Maddux. Hardt wrote that he had to vacate all sentences in the two cases.

"Deltona homeowner holds suspected burglar at gunpoint, deputies say","DELTONA, Fla. - A Deltona homeowner held a suspected burglar at gunpoint until authorities arrived, according to deputies.

The break-in was reported Saturday in the 600 block of Deltona Boulevard.

According to a Volusia County sheriff's incident report, the homeowner said he was awakened by the sound of breaking glass and discovered a man, later identified by officials as Michael Jiminez, in his home.

The homeowner said he got his 9mm handgun and told the man to leave and fired a warning shot into the ceiling because the man didn't immediately comply, according to deputies. The homeowner said he was in fear for his life, the incident report said.

Jiminez dropped to the ground when the gun was fired, and the homeowner called 911, deputies said.

Jiminez said he believed he heard a woman screaming for help inside the home, which used to be a business owned by someone he knew, according to authorities.

Jiminez said he broke a window with a pocketknife and entered the home, according to officials.

Deputies said Jiminez had a backpack containing hypodermic needles and cut straws, all of which tested positive for methamphetamine.

Jiminez was arrested on charges of armed burglary to an occupied structure, possession of amphetamine, possession of methamphetamine, possession of narcotics paraphernalia and criminal mischief.

No one was injured in the incident.

Triumph members urge county caution on golf course,"Count current Triumph Gulf Coast board member and former Florida Speaker of the House Allan Bense as no fan of Gulf County pursuing the purchase of a golf course.

His fellow Triumph board member Lewis Bear, Jr. has had some words of caution.

The board of Triumph Gulf Coast met last week and approved more than $5 million in grants to Gulf County.

The largest grant, for $4.27 million, came from a Triumph fund established to help the four counties most-impacted by Hurricane Michael with potential property tax losses.

In the final language of the grant proposal, the Triumph board included language that expressly barred the county from using any grant funds in the proposed purchase of a golf course.

And the board did so after some pointed criticism from Bense and later Bear.

Initially the Triumph board approved funding only 50 percent of any ad valorem or property tax shortfalls, but officials from Wakulla and Franklin counties would not be applying for hurricane relief funds from Triumph.

So, at last week’s meeting the Triumph board approved disbursing the remaining relief fund dollars to Gulf and Bay counties on a pro-rated basis based the original grant amounts.

Jason Shoaf, Gulf County’s representative on the Triumph board, asked when estimates of tax shortfalls would be certified and was informed they would be by July 1.

Assistant County Administrator Warren Yeager was asked to the podium to discuss how the county would disburse the additional dollars, Yeager noting the original application was for 50 percent so the additional funds would bring local governments closer to “being whole” from Hurricane Michael tax impacts.

Bense quickly turned the discussion to reports of the Board of County Commissioners pursuing the purchase of St. Joseph Bay Golf Club.

“I’m not sure what possessed them to do that,” Bense said.

At its last regular monthly meeting the last week of April, the BOCC heard from Administrator Michael Hammond on the proposed purchase.

Hammond said county staff “have been in negotiations” with the country club and urged board support to “conclude” the deal while providing an outline of the deal.

That outline included a purchase price of the club’s current debt or $390,000, whichever number was lower, that would include all equipment, grounds, the restaurant and meeting room.

The county would hire an operator but would subsidize operations for three years at up to $100,000 per year.

Bense said half-a-dozen Bay County golf courses had recently closed and he had recently passed on being paid to assume ownership of another course.

And there was a very good reason for both.

“They (golf courses) don’t make money,” Bense said, adding that the course which he owns, Holiday Golf Club, makes money only because of the 25,000 rental units and condos within a short distance.

Bear said he was an officer at Escambia County country club for years and every year membership had to be assessed additional fees to meet maintenance needs.

In addition, Bear said he had “lost a couple of million (dollars)” as an owner or investor in golf courses.

“Tell me the Board of County Commissioners is not getting into that business,” Bense asked of Yeager. “I hope you are looking at the numbers.”

And, he added, the county receiving Triumph grant funding for property tax shortfalls while pursuing the purchase of a golf course did not “look real smart” and the “optics are not positive.”

Yeager emphasized the county did not have “ad valorem” dollars for such a purchase and was only contemplating the buy because the county had been approached by the club’s membership.

The county hoped to support tourism by purchasing the club and had a fifth-cent of bed tax generating to apply to the purchase.

“No matter what, ad valorem taxes dollars will not go into that (purchase),” Yeager said.

Given that, Yeager was asked if the county would be okay with the Triumph board ensuring the funds were not used on the golf course in language for the motion approving the grant.

“Absolutely, our board would not have an issue with that,” Yeager said.

Yeager characterized the county as “early in negotiations” with the golf club leadership on the purchase price as well as exploring whether the purchase was a legal use of bed taxes.

Fifth-penny dollars were already set aside for a project at the 10th Street ball parks, but Yeager said that project was now stalled.

Bense said the fifth-penny and property taxes were part of a similar coin to most people.

“Fifth-penny, ad valorem, to the working man that’s taxes,” Bense said. “I sure would caution you about a golf course.”",https://www.starfl.com/news/20190509/triumph-members-urge-county-caution-on-golf-course?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T23:37:40Z,"The Star, Port St. Joe","101 W Hwy 98, Port St Joe, FL 32456, USA"
"Plovers, Sanderlings and knowing the difference","Each week I have the privilege of looking through the many photos were receive for our “Scene Around” page.

Initiated on a whim, I mean a whim, the page has become the most-popular and most-read page in the paper each week and the array of folks, locals to visitors, who share photos is astounding and deeply appreciated.

However, with all those shots of nature, of the objects in them I am not an expert.

I am a “blow-in,” despite living in this community for nearly two decades.

I grew up in a big city, about the only bit of wildlife I can remember were the field rats we tried to pelt with rocks along the railroad tracks.

So, if a photographer identifies the species of animal or bird in their photo, far be it from me to disagree, even I might have an inkling.

Of course, if the mistake was obvious, I would not label what I knew to be a deer a hippopotamus, but the vast variety of wildlife; birds in particular, leave me flailing for identifying names.

Take a look at the guide to North American birds sometime; my, Lord, the difference species of buntings, sparrows and wrens would make one dizzy.

Anyway, last week, we, I, published a photo that was identified, by one of the top submitters for that page, as three snowy plovers on the beach.

I never thought another thing about it until a member of Barbara Eells’ army of turtle and shorebird volunteers zipping over a message noting that the birds were in fact sanderlings.

And, he added in so many words with a metaphorical elbow to the ribs, did I really want to disappoint Ms. Eells in such a way.

This, of course, for me ratcheted up the mistake by degrees.

Ms. Eells is, she would be horrified, I am sure, one of my local heroes.

One of those people who goes about her day with a deep well of faith and a passion beyond any passion I have known for the wildlife of this area.

She cares for her community, the one outside your doorway, like no one other and her dedication is something this community should get around to honoring one of these days.

She can spot and identify a bird and take personal ownership on the spot.

She is not just a league of her own, she is the major leagues.

And, to top that off, it was just a year ago that Ms. Eells allowed me on one of her morning nesting shorebird surveys and we were looking for the nests of a snowy plover.

I should know that Sanderlings are the little birds one sees feeding in the surf, not all that shy but not a bird you can get near.

If you have seen a snowy plover, far shyer, that is a treat.

As for today, there are four fledglings on a section of beach Eells likes to keep secret and I will honor that.

Last week, there were five new chicks from two nests.

She spotted two chicks swimming across a creek, photos of which are here.

But there are also quite a few birds missing since the storm, including “my old man and another male and female I usually have for nesting,” Eells said.

The hope is they show up in a data base somewhere in Florida.

My hope is she will accept my apology; plovers and sanderlings, I at least know the difference between those two.",https://www.starfl.com/news/20190509/plovers-sanderlings-and-knowing-difference?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T23:37:40Z,"The Star, Port St. Joe","101 W Hwy 98, Port St Joe, FL 32456, USA"
The Forgotten People Living in Tents 7 Months After Hurricane Michael,"Average rents have gone up nearly 14% since October to an average of $1,463 in Bay County, according to Zillow, compared to a nationwide increase of about 2.5% — if you can find a place to rent at all.

The hurricane damaged or destroyed nearly 60% of the housing stock of Bay County, and nearly 7 months later, a great many of the 20,000 people displaced by the storm are still living in campers, condemned homes, or outside in the yards of good Samaritans. The shortage of housing is being exacerbated by a concurrent housing boom, as opportunistic buyers race to scoop up a limited amount of salvageable land to rebuild, threatening to permanently displace the low-income residents of the county.

The hurricane, the strongest ever recorded on the Panhandle, killed 25 people and left behind $661 million worth of damages in sprawling Bay County, which is divided by a bridge that splits the wealthier Panama City Beach from the county’s desolate, forested acreage and smaller towns like Springfield.

For months, the 42-year-old has had to bathe under a garden hose or inside a rat-infested, dilapidated mobile home a few steps away. The mobile home was crushed by multiple trees felled by Hurricane Michael, which tore through this section of the Florida Panhandle last October. Yet two people still live in it.

SPRINGFIELD, Florida — Mary Adams ambled around inside her bright, multicolored tent, rearranging the few items that remind her that this strange place is supposed to be home now.

SPRINGFIELD, Florida — Mary Adams ambled around inside her bright, multicolored tent, rearranging the few items that remind her that this strange place is supposed to be home now. In addition to a sunken chaise lounge, there’s a tin of markers, some puffy paint, three stuffed animals, and a face mask, which she doesn’t have much use for anymore.

For months, the 42-year-old has had to bathe under a garden hose or inside a rat-infested, dilapidated mobile home a few steps away. The mobile home was crushed by multiple trees felled by Hurricane Michael, which tore through this section of the Florida Panhandle last October. Yet two people still live in it.

The hurricane, the strongest ever recorded on the Panhandle, killed 25 people and left behind $661 million worth of damages in sprawling Bay County, which is divided by a bridge that splits the wealthier Panama City Beach from the county’s desolate, forested acreage and smaller towns like Springfield.

The hurricane damaged or destroyed nearly 60% of the housing stock of Bay County, and nearly 7 months later, a great many of the 20,000 people displaced by the storm are still living in campers, condemned homes, or outside in the yards of good Samaritans. The shortage of housing is being exacerbated by a concurrent housing boom, as opportunistic buyers race to scoop up a limited amount of salvageable land to rebuild, threatening to permanently displace the low-income residents of the county.

Average rents have gone up nearly 14% since October to an average of $1,463 in Bay County, according to Zillow, compared to a nationwide increase of about 2.5% — if you can find a place to rent at all.

“That’s why people are still living in tents, because they can’t afford the rent. It’s horrible, compared to what it used to be,” Adams said. “I don’t think it’s right that there’s only a few houses left, and they’re charging more when you’ve lost everything you own.”

Bay County has no current count of its homeless population, but dozens are still living in semi-permanent tent communities like Adams has been forced into. For months, she and her 21-year-old son, Demarcus, have lived with seven other people in a single driveway amid a tangle of blue tarps, cracked trees, and collapsed homes, along with signs for roof fixing, mold eradication, and property-buying services.

“That’s why people are still living in tents, because they can’t afford the rent”

Panama City Mayor Greg Brudnicki concedes there’s a problem but says rental prices in the area should stabilize when “the inventory comes back online.” For now, city officials are looking at a run-up in housing prices similar to the bubble seen before the Great Recession in 2008, he said.

“You can morally think about it, but from a legal standpoint, it all boils down to you’ve got 10 people trying to buy the same thing,” Brudnicki said. “It’s supply and demand.”

Mark McQueen, Panama City’s manager, said affordable housing is the No. 1 issue the area’s focusing on, noting “here we are six months post-storm, and we have a number of citizens that are suffering.”

But he and Michael Johnson, the city’s director for community development, said the tent cities that have cropped up around Bay County are partly due to an influx of contractors looking for recovery-related labor.

For now, tens of thousands of Panhandle residents are facing another hurricane season either homeless or in severely damaged housing, with no obvious end in sight.

Janelle Crosby, 55, owns the property that Adams pitched her tent on. The crushed mobile home is hers, but she doesn’t have homeowners insurance and can’t afford to repair it on her own. Instead, she and her husband are living in a motorhome donated by a local preacher who found out she had Stage 3 breast cancer.

“We keep busy trying to survive.” Crosby said. “If another storm comes in, that’ll be it for us. If I could financially, I’d leave.”

There are four tents on the property, including two that Adams and her son occupy. Two more people, who’d been renting her mobile home for $450 a month, are still living in the half that’s habitable, at no cost.

Another homeless woman and a 68-year-old disabled man also live in tents on the property.

Though victims have gotten some help from the federal government, it’s been no match for the rising rents. In the months after the storm, the Federal Emergency Management Agency provided to Bay County 810 travel trailers, direct lease properties, and mobile homes. Statewide, FEMA doled out assistance to 21,038 people so they could find temporary housing.

The agency, which is primarily focused on immediate, short-term disaster needs, gave out more than $142 million in individual assistance grants across the state of Florida to cover temporary hotel stays, rentals and repairs. (The federal government has allocated more than $1.1 billion to the Panhandle post-hurricane, overall.)

This week, Florida's state legislature secured an additional $115 million to specifically address the housing shortage in Bay County through a state appropriations bill.

Meanwhile, Congress has been deadlocked over a $17 billion disaster-aid bill to help Florida, Georgia, flooded states in the Midwest, and fire-ravaged California. But the bill has been held up by partisan rancor over how much money to send to Puerto Rico.

President Donald Trump, speaking in Panama City Beach during a campaign rally Wednesday night, praised the work the federal government has done so far to rebuild Bay County. “Panama City Beach is open for business, as beautiful as ever,” he said, before slamming the aid Democrats want to give to Puerto Rico. “We’ve already given you billions of dollars, and there is a lot more coming.”

For Adams, the aid so far has amounted to $1,734 in FEMA assistance after the storm but was unable to find local replacement housing on that amount of money.

“Where the frick am I going to go with two kids on $1,700 — two kids and no job and no car? Where are you going to move into and pay deposits, light and water for $1,700? You’re not,” Adams said.

Amid the obvious homelessness and destruction on the Panhandle, the residential rental market is booming.

A one-bedroom, one-bath apartment near Tyndall Air Force Base in Bay County that listed for $795 a month before the storm, for example, was re-listed in February at $1,195 a month, according to Zillow. A larger four-bedroom home near the beach listed for $1,400 a month last May but ratcheted up to $3,000 by the time it was back on the market in February.

A sunny-yellow, four-bedroom home near the water in East Bay was recently tagged: “HOUSE SURVIVED THE HURRICANE!” A year ago, it was renting for $3,100 a month. Now it’s going for $6,000.

“Business is very good, but it’s a lot of struggling to find a house that fits the price range of the customer,” said John Shook, a local real estate broker with Exit Sands Realty. “The people that are shut of the market are the people that are trying to find the very cheap houses.”

Shook noted that more reasonably priced units are rented almost instantly, and there’s no shortage of willing buyers. “If it’s available, and rentable, it’s being rented,” he said.

In rental-dense areas, developers tend to buy up newly cheap property and build new units that old tenants can’t afford, said Eric Tars, legal director at the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty. That’s what forced low-income people out of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and stoked rapid gentrification there, he added.

“To pretend we have a free market in this country is absurd. Most often the so-called free market is one that’s balanced in favor of people who have means to be able to access it,” Tars said. “Every community kind of assumes if we only build high-income housing, we’ll only have high-income people.”

In the area across the bridge from the more affluent Panama City Beach, outdoor living has become the norm for some people. In nearby Bayou George, Florida, for example, 50-year-old Shelly Summers said she had at least 26 people living on her five-acre property as of May 1, and she expected more would come because FEMA’s short-term hotel vouchers recently ran out on 250 hurricane-surviving households.

Sitting on her back porch last week, she slid on her glasses when her phone dinged with a message. “Probably somebody going to be needing to come here,” Summers said.

By that, she meant the person might pull up later with whatever they had left after Hurricane Michael to pitch a tent in her backyard.

She and her husband make the new backyard tenants abide by a slim set of rules: No shoes in the house, no drugs, no drinking, no drama. But she offers up a home-cooked meal each night in return for help feeding her nearly 100 pet rabbits and for someone to talk to.

“Rent has doubled, if not tripled, and in some places more than that,” Summers, known as “Miss Shelly” to her tenants, said. “This is why new people are still coming in. If you’re going to raise the rent, you better raise the wages.”

Minimum wage in Florida is $8.46 an hour; per-capita annual wages in Bay County are about $27,000. Summers said many of her tent-dwellers are either working or receiving disability payments.

Adam Currington, 31, and girlfriend Chelsey Ecko, 29, came to Summers’ place three weeks ago after bouncing from hotel to hotel with help from FEMA, since their landlord kicked them out after the storm and moved higher-paying renters in. FEMA also gave them $2,000 and “expected us to go get a place on that,” Currington said.

Another backyard-dweller, Tracey Hamilton, cleans condos and businesses for work and also came to Summers’ property three weeks ago. The 51-year-old survivor of domestic abuse had been sleeping under the partial roof of a condemned trailer, wrecked by the storm.

She’s looked at homes that were $800 a month before the storm and are now going for $1,600. She tried to compromise and buy an RV for $500, but found she’d have to pay nearly $700 a month to rent a space on an RV lot. She didn’t want her son staying in the damaged trailer, so she relinquished custody of him after the storm. He lives with her mother now.

“He needs a stable life, and right now I can’t give him that,” Hamilton said. She’s not sure when she’ll be able to move into an affordable studio apartment.

Amber Polenz, a 30-year-old Panama City mom of a child with cerebral palsy, is trying to make a home out of a small RV in a parking lot with several other vehicles like hers, plus a smattering of tents. She’ll be there until her family can save up for a downpayment on a new home.

At first, she was looking at studio apartments that were more than $1,000 a month, which she said wasn’t tenable. But she needed something to keep her safe after her trailer home was destroyed. That’s how she wound up in the parking lot.

“Whenever you ask for help here, you do not get it. You have to fight for it,” Polenz said. She was previously applying for rental assistance and a FEMA trailer but was denied because the agency said her trailer was still livable. “We had trees coming through the roof. My son’s floor was literally split in half, buckled.”

Prior to Hurricane Michael, Adams was already teetering on the edge of poverty. Her sole sources of income were $750 in Social Security benefits her son Demarcus receives each month for a cognitive disability, and money from watching other people’s kids.

Adams suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which makes it difficult for her to breathe and work on her feet. To complicate matters even further, she was staying with another woman in the projects, and they both separately applied for FEMA assistance based on the same property damages.

Adams initially took the money FEMA gave her and moved to Dothan, Alabama, about 90 minutes away — the only place where she could find an apartment cheap enough to afford a security deposit and first month’s rent.

Unable to find a job within the first month and make the $900-a-month rent again, Adams was evicted and soon found herself at Crosby’s property with a tent. Adams lost her mother’s ashes in the storm and said Crosby feels like the mom she needs right now.

She received a letter from FEMA last Thursday saying the agency’s records indicated she “and another member of your household received assistance for the same disaster losses,” which is known as an out-of-line “duplication of benefits.”

She might now owe FEMA the same $1,734 that couldn’t get her back on her feet.

Rather matter-of-factly, Adams added that she feels like she might die in the next few years, and that Crosby needs the money more. She put the FEMA letter on the table next to the chaise lounge in her tent, to deal with later.

“She’s the one who needs the house,” Adams said. “Two years — I don’t know if I’ll make it for two years. I don’t know if I’ll live that long.”

Larry Kelly always bets on his horses.

As general manager of the Payson Park Training Facility in Indiantown, Kelly tried to keep up the tradition for this year's Kentucky Derby, but he lost service on his iPad before the race. When he got back on the internet, it was too late to place his bet.

Maybe Kelly was jinxing his horses all along.

More: Initial Kentucky Derby DQ led to failed 4-year legal odyssey

Country House, Code of Honor and Tacitus, who were being trained at Payson Park right before the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, took first, second and third place in the race.

If Kelly had made the $336 bet he planned, he would’ve won $3,000.

“The consolation was to be very proud of Payson Park,” Kelly said. “The odds of those three horses being one-two-three all coming out of here just literally weeks ago is pretty amazing.”

Tacitus left Payson Park a month before the Kentucky Derby to head to a New York race, but the top two winners, Country House and Code of Honor, were training in Indiantown up until a week before they shipped out for the derby.

Just to have them finish in second, third and fourth places was crazy enough, Kelly said.

The circumstances were even wilder because the original first place winner, Maximum Security, was disqualified after an interference objection.

“When they took it down (Maximum Security's win), that was in its own right basically history,” Kelly said. “But then for Payson Park to have the one, two, three finishers — you have as good of a shot at winning the lottery.”

It would be rare for any training facility to occupy all three top spots, he said.

California, which likely has between 4,000 and 5,000 horses stabled between two training centers, has maybe five to six of them run in the Kentucky Derby — and one of those might hit the board.

More: Life remains normal for Kentucky Derby winner Country House

He noted a big exception would be California-based trainer Bob Baffert, who won the Triple Crown with American Pharaoh in 2015 and Justify in 2018.

Bill Mott, who lives in Palm City, was the trainer for first place Country House and third place Tacitus. Claude R. McGaughey III, who won the Kentucky Derby in 2013 with Orb — also out of Payson Park — was the trainer for second place Code of Honor.

“All of Martin County should be extremely proud,” Kelly said. “There’s a little bit of a lack of knowledge (about Payson Park).”

The training facility gets about 30 calls each month, many asking to come ride, but it doesn’t have horses for riding.

However, Payson Park is open to the public, he said. The horses train from Oct. 15 to May 15 every year, but the facility still is open on weekdays for people to explore even when the horses aren’t training.

“We don’t have much other than you’re just welcome to come and watch some of the best thoroughbreds in the world train,” Kelly said.

More: Kentucky Derby winner Country House won't run in Preakness

Payson Park, which has been voted one of the top training centers in the world, is well-known nationally and internationally in the horse racing realm.

It’s important for 2-year-old horses turning 3 to get sunshine because that’s their bone-strengthening year, Kelly said. Even when he used to race horses in New York, he always would send them south for the sun.

The Indiantown training facility is different from others because it limits the number of horses to 500 and doesn’t train year-round.

More: Analysis: Horse racing under microscope again with Derby DQ

“It’s unique in a way that it’s not overcrowded or overused,” Kelly said.

That appeal has attracted five of the top trainers internationally, as well as horses from across the world, including South Africa, Germany and Australia.

Even sheikhs and the Queen of England, who’s a friend of owner Virginia Kraft Payson, keep their horses in Indiantown, he said.

“They’re all expensive horses,” Kelly said. “They come here to get ready for these derby races.”

The training facility has a 1-mile dirt course track that’s been rated one of the best in the nation, he said. It also has a 7/8-mile turf course, which is unusual for training centers, and several miles of galloping trails that go out through the woods.

“It’s a place where people take their horse to get ready for the coming year,” Kelly said. “It’s just a spring training camp for the best.”

Kelly, who’s father was the first trainer at what was then the St. Lucie Training Center when it opened in the 1950s, had his eye on several Payson Park horses that looked promising this year.

“As we were coming close a couple months ago, a couple of them were up there in the points,” Kelly said. “It was like, ‘holy God man, we might have a couple run in the derby,’ which is cool.”

By the time of the Kentucky Derby, he thought all three horses had legitimate chances. Still, Kelly didn’t get too excited because every year brings horses that have the points, but seem too young and haven’t won enough races to do what he described as the equivalent of crawling into the boxing ring with Mike Tyson.

But it wasn’t a total shock to have winners out of Payson Park, which typically puts out horses that are major players in racing, he said.

The training facility has had winners in the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes.

“Our next goal will have to be to have a Triple Crown winner,” Kelly said.

""The Crazy Water Day"" by Ella Rose Briones

Let me describe a daft water fun day!

The day’s temperature was hot and humid.

My sister said, “Do you want to go play?”

I hopped up and made a pyramid.

“Look out,” screamed my Jack Russell Terrier,

“Yikes, there’s a baby shark on the next street.”

“Oh who cares,” Sis said, “the more the merrier,

but be careful or you’ll be its sweet treat.”

“Run fast, “cried my Husky, “it will get you!”

“No way, I want the excitement,” I said.

But when I saw the shark it just sang pew.

Mom yelled, “You are insane! Go to bed!”

I know this all sounds incredibly crazy.

It really is very surprisingly hazy.

""Yesterday’s Sonnet"" by Abby Lunsford

With paper in hand, I watch the sun rise;

The sun has gone down on my yesterday,

Marking the hardships the past years comprise

As I brush the sadness and pain away.

Looking forth from the past to what’s ahead,

Thinking of all I did and all I’ll do;

Of the things I wanted to do instead,

And all I did despite knowing the truth.

Now at the dawn I begin life again,

So sparkling and fresh, a tender new day.

And all the more as I pick up a pen,

I consider my new sonnet today.

My burdens laid down, I know I can say

I’m glad I let go of my yesterday.

""Misery"" by Vanessa Yunussova

Everyone knows that feeling of despair,

How you feel that you'll be blue forever,

When all you wish to do, is just sit there,

The thought that feeling glee is a never.

This feeling and I have become quite close,

I know this too well to act unconcerned,

Some people have their daily dreary dose,

Feeling that all this pain, they simply earned.

No one enjoys these melancholic thoughts,

Where you feel all empty on the inside,

And you believe all your heart does, is rots,

That joy is lost, regardless if you tried.

The thought that dismal is where you belong,

Fills your heard, but you must be extra strong.

Untitled by Liz Garone

In our youth we do not anticipate

Bliss lost along with ignorance we’ll find

Comes with the end of spring it is innate

Can opened eyes retain an opened mind?

Yet youth is like a flower yet to bloom

Left closed how can it show what is inside?

Left sealed a bud will not know of the room

It had to grow if only it had tried

But as a bud has petals all along

So do our minds with knowledge to be found

Need to taste the fruit called life is not wrong,

But rather the only way we are unbound

So growing up is just a way to bide

The child that we all still have inside.

""Siren Song"" by Thelonious Linford

...and as I floated on the tranquil sea

I came across a strange, small, floating isle

And there one lone young woman sang to me

Her voice stretched out, all men near to beguile

Her skin was soft and fair like brightest snow

Around her head her golden braids did twist

None other did my red heart want to know

Than this fair maiden; salt air and sea kiss’d

But something made her seem more siren like

Perhaps the scaly glint upon her skin

Or yellow teeth each sharpened like a knife

Which shone as her voice tried to draw me in

Thus warned, we set out 'cross the stormy brine

But even now she preys upon my mind

""Sonnet of Beckett"" by Aidan Monroe

To stand before the tyrant of nine kings

Beneath the confines of hallowed comfort,

Thy lord enslaves me through locks without keys

Lest I appeal to his home winter court.

His words will cut through my skin as if swords,

His posture transforms abodes into cells;

And those among him patrol 'bout the ward

directing their demands till I've been felled.

But what grand honors my king provides me:

To groom his fur coat and polish his crown;

Dependence unheard, affections unseen

His love makes this heart dare not let him down.

For never a storm born summer compare

A monster so loyal, brutish and fair.

""Gloriana"" by Bob Ferdinand

(an acrostic sonnet)

England’s great queen, fairest jewel of our isle!

Lady most gracious, whose praises we sing —

Inspire fair-flourishing Nature, while

Zephyrs blow sweetly in earliest Spring.

Abounding in virtue, temp’rate and wise,

Benevolent justice flows from her hands

Ensnaring the wicked, dishonor and lies

To strengthen and prosper all she commands.

Her beauty shines warmly, pure as the sun!

Timeless and radiant, heaven’s true light.

Unrival’d in glory, God’s Chosen One!

Dauntless she rises to take up the fight.

Our love and devotion grow stronger each year,

Renown’d Gloriana — queen without peer.

""One Fair Morn’"" by John Ryan Hall

One fair morn I found me in a forest

Beside a birch I imagined I would form

An arrow from it’s faithful inmost breast

I fancied that I would face the storm

Of those fierce darts that cause me dread

I decided I too would be armed

To strike the little demon of love dead

Only then could I be free from harms

Yet Jove’s imp scorned the image in my mind

And swiftly assigned your eyes to reside

Instead of those arrows only orbs I find

Thus he did all my engines deride

For how can I that deathless boy overcome

When I looked in your eyes and knew you’re the one.

"" Ah, Time Itself doth help us ably age"" by Thomas Robert Moore

(The title is from Line 9, a frequent Shakespearean “transition"")

Whilst young, n’er did I fret ‘bout growing old.

Yet Time doth boldly bring its storms and rain.

So soon learned I, one’s health’s worth more than gold,

As Time deals deftly Aging’s aches and pain.

My eyes and ears do fail me all too fast.

How can I win Life’s fickle flirt with Fate?

Or hope to cope, breathe breaths that long will last?

And find loud laughs, sweet smiles? And not too late?

Ah, Time Itself doth help us ably age:

We find the means o’er time to learn what’s real.

The very limits Life makes us engage,

Do bring near, All we see, hear, smell and feel.

We can embrace whate’er we treasure most.

Then, daily live that love we each hold close.

Top 10 college basketball recruiting classes: Arizona edges Duke for top class,"LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - APRIL 20: James Wiseman #32 warms up at halftime of the Jordan Brand Classic boys high school all-star basketball game at T-Mobile Arena on April 20, 2019 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)

The 10 best college basketball recruiting classes sees Arizona edge Duke for the top class in 2019 with Kentucky, UNC, USC among the top classes.

College basketball’s recruiting period is wrapping up and Arizona owns the No. 1 recruiting class after overtaking Duke. There are a few big names still uncommitted, including the re-classified R.J. Hampton, but for the most part, college rosters are all but set for the upcoming season. While the commitments of Hampton and several others could shake up the rankings, let’s take a look at the top 10 classes right now, beginning with (once again) Duke.

1. Arizona

Nico Mannion, Josh Green, Zeke Nnaji, Terry Armstrong, Christian Koloko

The Wildcats missed the NCAA Tournament last season, but Arizona has a loaded class coming in to try and get back to the dance. The big question remains whether Sean Miller will be around to coach the team considering his links to the FBI’s recruiting probe.

2. Duke

Vernon Carey, Wendell Moore, Cassius Stanley, Matthew Hurt

Even though Zion Williamson and friends are off to the NBA, Duke is reloading with another incredible class of one-and-done starts. Point guard Tre Jones will have a lot of fun dishing to impact scorers like Carey, Moore, and Hurt.

3. Kentucky

Kahlil Witney, Tyreke Maxey, Keion Brooks, Dontaie Allen

Another prominent team atop the recruiting rankings is Kentucky, which always gets a significant roster of one-and-done players to compete for championships under John Calipari. While P.J. Washington and Tyler Herro are among the Wildcats off to the NBA, Witney and Maxey are poised to step into the spotlight at Rupp Arena.

4. Villanova

Bryan Antoine, Jeremiah-Robinson Earl, Justin Moore, Eric Dixon

The last remnants of the 2018 national championship team are gone, but Jay Wright is set to build his next dynasty with one of his best recruiting classes. The star of this class could be Antoine, who has the ability to put the ball in the basket in a lot of different ways.

5. USC

Signings: Isaiah Mobley, Onyeka Okongwu, Max Agbonkpolo, Kyle Sturdivant

Like Arizona before them, USC was a Pac-12 disappointment, failing to reach the NCAA Tournament despite some preseason predictions of a deep March run. The Trojans could rectify that with the nation’s fifth-best class, which offers a wide variety of complementing skill sets to lead to a more balanced roster.

6. Florida

Scottie Lewis, Tre Mann, Omar Payne, Jason Jitoboh

After making a stealthy run into the NCAA Tournament last season, Florida is poised to build on this success with this strong recruiting class. Scottie Lewis is an elite defender who can take on pretty much anyone the SEC can offer while Mann has a chance to be a star at the point.

7. North Carolina

Cole Anthony, Armando Bacot, Anthony Harris, Jeremiah Francis

For a little while, things looked hairy for North Carolina, which lost Cameron Johnson and Luke May to graduation and saw Coby White and Nassir Little declare for the NBA Draft. Everything changed when Cole Anthony, the top point guard in the class, committed to Chapel Hill and could power the Tar Heels to the top of the ACC.

8. Louisville

Samuell Williamson, Aidan Iegihon, David Johnson, Josh Nickelberry, Jaelyn Withers, Quinn Slazinski

The Cardinals may not have the one top-end stud like a Vernon Carey or Cole Anthony, but Chris Mack got a ton of potential impact players in this class. After a disappointing first round exit in March, Louisville’s freshman class could help lead to more long term success.

9. Gonzaga

Drew Timme, Anton Watson, Martynas Arlauskas, Brock Ravet

Gonzaga got hit hard by graduation (Josh Perkins) and the draft (Rui Hachimura and Brandon Clarke declared), but Mark Few has responded with one of his best recruiting classes. The Bulldogs should continue to dominate the WCC with this crew of freshmen heading to campus this fall.

T10. Memphis

James Wiseman, DJ Jeffries, Malcolm Dandridge, Damion Baugh

The Tigers already pulled off a shocker by landing James Wiseman, the No. 1 recruit in the class, and Penny Hardaway’s team is in the mix for a ton of the top uncommitted guys, like Hampton and Precious Achiuwa. Landing a few of those players could shoot the Tigers way up this list and into legitimate title contention.

T10. Georgia

Anthony Edwards, Christian Brown, Jaykwon Walton. Sahvir Wheeler, Toumani Camara

Tom Crean pulled off a recruiting coup when Georgia landed the commitment from the nation’s No. 2 recruit, Anthony Edwards. The 6-5, 215-pound shooting guard from Atlanta’s Holy Spirit Prep School is expected to be a one-and-done in Athens, but it could be the best season for Georgia basketball in a long time. Joining Edwards are small forwards, No. 66 recruit SF Christian Brown and No. 77 recruit Jaykwon Walton.

"Window-sticker arrest: Is it offensive? Sure, but obscene? Maybe not","""I think this falls under offensive speech, which is protected by the First Amendment,"" said First Amendment expert Clay Calvert.

A North Central Florida arrest has gained national attention, with most headlines tagging a pickup driver with an unyielding belief in the First Amendment as a “Florida man,” a colloquial term placed on eccentrics in the news.

Lake City's Dillon Shane Webb, 23, objected when a Columbia County sheriff’s deputy Sunday found a sticker on the back window of the man’s Chevy truck to be obscene and wouldn't alter it, even to get off the hook.

Columbia County Sheriff’s Deputy Travis English would later arrest Webb for possession of obscene material and resisting an officer, after he refused to take an “S” off the sticker to make the message road-worthy.

One University of Florida expert believes prosecutors will have a hard time proving English’s belief the sticker was obscene.

In white, block-style letters, the slightly off-centered message reads, “I EAT A**.”

Webb insisted that he has a First Amendment right to make the declaration.

Clay Calvert, a First Amendment expert and director of the Brechner First Amendment Project in the UF College of Journalism and Communications, said the sticker’s words may be offensive to some people, but in the opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, there’s a difference between offensive and obscene speech.

“It’s a words-only case, which is extremely rare. I think this falls under offensive speech, which is protected by the First Amendment.”

In court, Calvert said prosecutors would have to prove the sticker obscene through the Miller test, a standard used by courts to define obscenity.

The three-part test comes from the 1973 Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling in Miller v. California in which the court ruled that obscene materials did not enjoy First Amendment protections.

The first step in the Miller test is to determine whether the average person, applying “contemporary community standards would find the work, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interests.”

In layman's terms, the prosecutor would have to prove that an average Joe would find the words almost pornographic, to be hard-core sexual conduct and that it appealed to “shameful or morbid interests in sex,” Calvert said.

Calvert's skeptical that Webb's case would make it past the first test. He said prosecutors would have a hard time proving the average person wouldn’t understand the sticker was meant to be a joke.

“I don’t think anyone is going to find this appeals to shameful or morbid interest in sex. It’s a three-word statement that intends to be amusing,” he said. “It might be sophomoric and offensive but I don’t think it’s obscene … I think it’d be best to not prosecute it.”

Sgt. Murray Smith, spokesman for the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office, said the office stands behind the deputy’s decision to arrest Webb.

“Every deputy has discretion in certain areas,” Smith said. “Our deputy believed this was a violation of state statute.”

Webb was arrested under Florida Statute 847.011.2, which describes violators as someone “who knowingly has in his or her possession, custody, or control any obscene book, magazine, periodical, pamphlet, newspaper, comic book, story paper, written or printed story or article, writing, paper, card, picture, drawing, photograph, motion picture film, film, any stickers, decals, emblem or other device attached to a motor vehicle …”

Obscenity cases where there is no imagery attached are extremely rare, Calvert said. The sticker being just three words would make it an even tougher case to prove.

For historical context, Calvert reflected back to an early 1960s case in which comedian Lenny Bruce was convicted of giving obscene comedic performances and sentenced to four months in prison.

Things have changed since then, Calvert said.

Smith said he isn't sure if the case will make it through the judicial system but that’s not the Sheriff’s Office’s job.

“Our job is not to interpret the law,"" Smith said. ""It’s our job to establish whether there is probable cause to make an arrest and he did.”

English gave Webb the opportunity to appear in court on the obscenity charge in lieu of an arrest but he refused, according to Smith.

“If he refuses, then you really have no other option but to arrest him,” he said.

Webb's truck was turned over to his mother, though Smith said English wanted to have the truck towed. He didn't want the message on the road anymore.

“We called a tow truck because we did not want the sticker to corrupt the public morals again,"" Smith said.

The truck was put on the tow truck but eventually taken back down after Webb paid a fee, he wrote on his Facebook page.

A reporter asked Third Judicial Circuit prosecutor John Durrett if he was aware of the case and if State Attorney Jeff Siegmeister plans to prosecute the case.

Durett let out a laugh like he’d heard a good joke, before saying no decision has been made on that front.

“You hear me chuckling but everything has to go through the normal process,” he said, still chuckling. “I mean, it's making friggin’ national news. We have to look at everything.”

Webb told The Associated Press he plans to file a wrongful arrest lawsuit with the Sheriff's Office. Asked Wednesday afternoon if he still intends to, he replied: ""Maybe.""

His next court date is May 23. The sticker, he said, is still on his truck.",https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190508/window-sticker-arrest-is-it-offensive-sure-but-obscene-maybe-not?rssfeed=true,2019-05-08T16:17:13Z,Gainesville Sun,"2700 SW 13th St, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA"
Lake City man arrested over vulgar sticker on truck,"After being given a notice to appear, the driver refused to remove part of the sticker, citing the First Amendment. That's when the deputy arrested him.

A Lake City man with a crude sticker on the back window of his Chevy truck ended up in the Columbia County jail Sunday after he refused to alter the offending words, citing his right to free speech.

A Columbia County sheriff's deputy pulled the pickup over on U.S. 90 around 5:50 p.m. after seeing the sticker — which stated ""I EAT A**"" in white letters, according to an arrest report. The deputy considered the statement a violation of Florida obscenity laws.

The driver and owner of the truck, Dillon Shane Webb, 23, became defensive when the deputy explained why he had been pulled over.

""They're just words,"" he said, according to the deputy's account.

""I then asked Dillon how a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words,"" the report says. Webb responded that it would be up to the parent.

The deputy issued a notice to appear on the obscenity violation, a second-degree misdemeanor.

Then, the deputy wrote, ""I allowed him to remove one of the letters from the word 'A**' so the statement would no longer be derogatory."" But, he said, Webb refused to do so, citing the First Amendment.

That's when the deputy arrested him on a charge of resisting an officer without violence, a first-degree misdemeanor, and took him to jail. The truck was towed.

Bail was set at $2,500, and Webb was released at 8:50 that evening.

Record Tiger Shark caught near Marco Island,"Mark Stock landed what he said is a record class tiger shark on April 25 while fishing off Marco Island with charter Captain Ben Olsen. The creature measured 14 ½ feet,.

The current state record is a 1,065-pound tiger shark measured at 12 ½ feet and caught out of Pensacola waters in 1981. Stock’s shark was estimated to weigh more than 1,100 pounds, but its exact weight will never be known as it was immediately released.

Olsen said he’s caught tiger sharks exceeding 12 feet but “this shark was truly special, and our number-one priority was to get her released in good shape, as quickly as possible.”

Beth Deacy, a biologist with NOAA Fisheries Panama City Lab and head of its shark-tagging program, told Stock that based on this shark’s length in comparison with similar sized tigers, she would most likely put its age between 15 and 20 years.

A Sunday bike ride through an Ormond Beach park was anything but pleasant for a woman and her boyfriend.He said he rode right into a fishing line, tied off between a dock and a tree, that was at neck height.The man said he had to fall off his bike to avoid a possible life-threatening injury.The couple alerted police, who took a report and suggested it might have been homeless people in the woods using fishing line to dry clothes, but the couple feels certain this was no accident.""I'm lucky to walk away. It's just scary to think that something like that is out here,"" the man said.The man and his girlfriend asked WESH 2 News not to show their faces since they ride bikes in Central Park almost daily, and fear reprisal for sounding the alarm. But the victim showed WESH 2 News his neck with an angry red mark along his throat where fishing line tied across a path near the Joyce Ebbets Pier caught him. He had to fall off his bike to save himself.""It was burning, like somebody was like, taking fishing wire or something like that trying to decapitate me the whole time,"" he said.""All of a sudden, he goes down to the ground and I see the line come up out of his neck,"" the man's girlfriend said.His girlfriend shared a picture on social media with an arrow showing where the fishing line was located -- fishing line with a hook attached. It had rained, so the pair weren't riding too fast. If they had been riding faster or if the test line had been thicker, she thinks the outcome could have been far more serious.""He could have gone right through it, and it could have taken his head off in all reality,"" she said.Both are sure the fishing line was placed along the path deliberately.It was intentional. There's no way that this could have been somebody's fishing line that got hung up on the dock and they just walked with it because it would have been laying on the ground. It was strung up at neck height on purpose.:Police did a search and didn't find any more possible booby traps.The couple just wants other people in the area to be aware. The couple said if a child ran down the road toward the pier and scenic outlook and encountered fishing line, they could really be put at risk.They rode the path on Monday and found no obstacles.",https://www.wesh.com/article/bicyclist-injured-by-fishing-line-ormond-beach/27383499,2019-05-07T12:20:00Z,WESH-TV,"1021 Wymore Rd, Winter Park, FL 32789, USA"

East Naples man found guilty of DUI manslaughter related to 2014 crash after second jury trial,"Kiereek Seymour Jr. appears at a hearing to confirm a date for his trial on charges of DUI and fleeing and eluding at the Collier County Courthouse on Tuesday, Jan. 12, 2016. (Photo: Dorothy Edwards/Naples Daily New)

Jurors convicted an East Naples man accused of driving under the influence and killing a woman in a 2014 crash after deliberating for a little over an hour on Monday.

Kiereek Seymour, 29, of East Naples, was charged with DUI manslaughter after an early morning crash at Lakewood and Davis boulevards in East Naples on May 19, 2014.

Sandra Marie Maddux, 54, of East Naples, died from injuries suffered in the crash.

Jurors began deliberations around 4:30 p.m. Monday and returned with the guilty verdict at 5:45 p.m.

The two-week trial began April 22 and was the second related to the DUI manslaughter charge brought against Seymour.

The first trial ended in February when Collier Circuit Judge Joseph Foster declared a mistrial after a juror came out of the jury room during deliberations and indicated she was feeling uncomfortable.

Seymour is set to be sentenced in front of Foster on June 26 at 3:30 p.m.

Previously: DUI manslaughter case: Jury can't reach verdict; East Naples man to face new trial

Both trials included conflicting assertions about whether Seymour was driving the vehicle he was found in, who was at fault in the crash and whether Seymour's blood-alcohol content was above 0.08, the legal limit for driving.

Assistant State Attorney Mara Marzano began her closing argument on Monday by telling the jurors that Maddux lost her life because Seymour was driving impaired due to the alcohol and alprazolam he had in his system at the time of the crash.

While Defense Attorney Peter Adrien said the state had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Seymour was driving the vehicle, was actually impaired or was at fault in the crash that killed Maddux.

Witness testimony proved Seymour was driving the vehicle involved in the crash with Maddux, Marzano said.

""There was never anyone else there,” Marzano said. “There was never any possibility that anyone else got out of that car and ran away.”

Seymour was found by witnesses positioned on the passenger side of the vehicle after the crash and it’s not the defense’s burden to prove who, if it wasn’t Seymour, was driving the vehicle, Adrien said.

Evidence collected by officers from the Florida Highway Patrol showed that Seymour was speeding and driving at least 62 mph at the time of the crash, while Maddux was driving 18 mph, Marzano said.

Adrien told the jurors the investigation by Florida Highway Patrol officers was not done properly and the speeds of the vehicles involved in the crash changed in various versions of the crash report.

Witness testimony also showed that Seymour had a yellow traffic signal and Maddux a red traffic signal, Adrien said.

In addition, Adrien said Maddux’s car had no lights on after the crash. Maddux could have been driving the dark vehicle at night with no lights, which could have contributed to the crash, he said.

However, Seymour’s slurred speech and medical records from the hospital after the crash prove he was impaired, Marzano told the jurors.

“Nowhere here does it say we have to prove he was falling down drunk,” Marzano said.

Seymour admitted to an emergency responder that he had a consumed one and a half beers before the crash and hospital staff recorded Seymour as clinically intoxicated and high, Marzano said.

The additive effect of alprazolam and alcohol impaired Seymour, Marzano said.

“I told you this was a complicated matter,” Marzano said. “I would suggest to you when you pare it down to what is real and not real you will find the defendant guilty.""

Adrien said none of the testing or evidence presented by the state proved that Seymour was over the 0.08 blood-alcohol level limit.

""The defendant is not guilty and this was a horrible accident,” Adrien said. “How could he be? He was following all the traffic rules.”

Even before February’s mistrial, Seymour had been in court before to face charges related to the crash that killed Maddux.

The state attorney's office refiled the DUI manslaughter charge in 2016 after then-Collier Circuit Judge Fred Hardt vacated an earlier plea agreement.

The negotiated plea agreement related to charges stemming from a Marco Island crash and charges from the crash involving Maddux. Hardt wrote that he had to vacate all sentences in the two cases.

At a hearing in June 2016, Seymour’s attorneys argued that the officer’s sirens were not activated during the pursuit of Seymour in the Marco Island incident, court documents show.

In an August 2016 order to vacate the sentence, Hardt agreed with Seymour’s attorneys, writing that “the officer’s dash cam clearly demonstrates that his siren was not activated.”

Seymour was back at the Collier County Courthouse in April 2018 for a jury trial to face charges in the Marco Island incident.

After deliberating for four hours and returning for four more hours on a second day, six jurors found Seymour guilty on all charges related to the Marco Island incident on April 27, 2018.

However, in May 2018, Seymour was granted a new trial in that case after testimony revealed jurors found a law book left behind in the jury room and used it to deliberate.

The book had been left behind by a bailiff who was studying for the sergeant’s exam, the bailiff testified during the hearing in which Seymour was granted a new trial.

A new jury trial in the case related to the Marco Island incident is set to begin July 1 at 9 a.m. at the Collier County Courthouse.

Court throws out restraining order against Cantonment man whose daily walks irked neighbor,"A Cantonment man accused of “stalking” his neighbor was actually just doing everyday activities like walking his dog, throwing away trash and trying not to get hit by traffic, according to a recent Florida appellate court decision.

On Thursday, the Florida First District Court of Appeal reversed an injunction against Billy Stone requiring him to stay at least 500 feet away from the residence of his neighbor, Teresa McMillian.

McMillian requested the injunction after telling the court she had received a threatening letter from Stone and had seen him walk past her property more than 10 times a day on multiple days.

But in a 2017 circuit court hearing, Stone’s attorney added some critical context for the court to consider.

More: Trains blocking roads in Cantonment have one commissioner demanding action

Stone had been taking routine walks around the circular street he and McMillian lived on since 2009, witnesses said. During one of Stone’s walks in December 2016, McMillian honked her horn and intentionally drove her car at Stone and his dog, prompting them to jump out of the way.

Stone admitted the incident made him angry, so he put a threatening letter in her mailbox warning her not to “pull another stunt like she did today.”

After receiving the letter, McMillian said she felt intimidated by Stone walking his dog in a vacant property adjacent to her home, so she installed motion-activated sprinklers at the property line. When a soaking didn’t deter Stone, she called law enforcement on him for trespassing.

McMillian’s petition for a stalking injunction was denied by the trial court in July 2017, which noted the neighbors were engaged in “tit for tat” behavior and encouraging them to “go (their) separate ways.

Still, McMillian filed another petition for injunction two months later, this time arguing she had began reviewing her security cameras daily and logging how many times Stone walked past her house. She also complained of seeing Stone place dog waste in her roadside garbage can on one occasion, and on another step onto her driveway “to avoid being hit by a bus” despite being previously told to stay away from her property.

Stone testified he walks to alleviate anxiety, to visit with neighbors, and to help with the neighborhood watch program he helped develop. Six neighbors testified that Stone is active in the community and routinely walks past their house every day, often stopping to talk. Stone testified that he always picks up after his dog and, if it is trash day, will put it in the nearest can before it gets picked up; he admitted using McMillian’s can once, but denied it was an attempt to intimidate her.

Nonetheless the trial court granted McMillian a one-year injunction requiring Stone to stay clear of McMillian, her property and her vehicle.

Stone appealed the injunction, and the court agreed, finding McMillian took every innocuous act of Stone as one of aggression and intimidation, even though there was no evidence any of it was malicious.

“We do not disagree with Stone’s argument that he walks around his neighborhood, put dog waste in a trash can, and avoided getting hit by a bus for legitimate purposes under (Florida statute),” the court wrote.

Stone’s attorney, Robert Powell of Clark Partington, said his client “feels exonerated that justice was properly meted out” and relieved that the stain on his neighborhood reputation had been removed.

McMillian did not fight the appeal and has no listed attorney, however she has 15 days from the date of the opinion to contest the appellate court findings.

The arrest was part of a “significant drug investigation” that has led to arrest warrants for over 100 suspects, the sheriff’s office said.

Walls faces several charges, including conspiracy to possess controlled substance, solicitation to sell controlled substance, and unlawful use of a two-way device, deputies said.

How this racer went from a murder trial to the Indy 500,"CLOSE These drivers have won the Indianapolis 500 on more than one occasion. Three men have won it four times. Scott Horner/IndyStar

Which Indianapolis 500 driver drew the pole but started last because he arrived late to the track? — Louis Disbrow in 1912.

Which Indianapolis 500 driver was tried and acquitted of murder? — Louis Disbrow in 1903.

There's more to this intriguing man than answers to racing trivia, yet the latter question would be a black cloud that followed him through his life.

The speed king

When Louis Disbrow arrived at the 1911 Indianapolis 500 fresh from a victory in the 300-mile race at the Atlantic-Pablo Beach Races in Florida, his entry into the Indianapolis race was seen by many as quite a draw. Racing enthusiasts were impressed by his talent behind the wheel and his competitive nature.

Disbrow’s name often gets lost in the great assemblage of drivers in the early years of the Indianapolis 500, possibly because it was a track where he found little success. Disbrow raced in the first four Indianapolis 500 races with his best finish being 8th place in 1913.

An eloquent writer, Disbrow penned a technical, yet readable article for the Indianapolis Star in 1914 about the mechanics of auto racing, “What makes the racing car develop its terrific speed.”

Bad romance: When Carl Fisher got married — his jilted lover got even

However lackluster his performance was at Indianapolis, Disbrow was a bona-fide speed king and one of the most colorful characters of his era.

Following an accident at a racetrack in Albany, Georgia, Disbrow was thought to be dead and carted off to the morgue, where he lay for nine and a half hours covered with a sheet.

There are two different stories about what occurred later. In one version, Disbrow sat up from the coroner's table and demanded a cigarette, while the other had him get off the table with the sheet still over his head, sending a terrified nightwatchman running out of the door and into the street. In either scenario, “Corpse awakes in morgue” made for a terrific headline.

Disbrow was a veteran racer on dirt, sand, boards and bricks. He was known as the “King of the Dirt Tracks” and competed at nearly every track in Indiana during his day: Porter Race Track, Knox County Fairgrounds, Winchester, Roby Speedway and the Indiana State Fairgrounds.

During his racing career, he suffered 26 bone fractures. When Disbrow died in 1939, his obituary estimated he had driven 300,000 miles in his racing career.

A double murder

Before Disbrow’s success on the racetrack, an unsavory chapter in his life would haunt him for the rest of his life: He was indicted and stood trial for murder.

Louis Disbrow was born into privilege. His maternal grandfather was a millionaire businessman and his father was a wealthy retired fertilizer maker, who built a comfortable life for the family in Long Island that included a summer home in Good Ground in what is now known as Hamptons Bay, the playground of the elite.

It was here that the bodies of Sarah “Dimples” Lawrence and Clarence Foster washed up on the shore in 1902. Disbrow was indicted for their killings. During the trial, the prosecution alleged Disbrow was heartbroken that Lawrence had discarded him for Foster and claimed Disbrow had beaten Foster with an oar and killed Sarah Lawrence.

Despite a mountain of evidence against Disbrow, the jury was not convinced and acquitted him in both cases.

Following the trial, Disbrow was hired as a chauffeur and mechanic for the Cuneo family of New York and would eventually serve as a riding mechanic for Joan Cuneo, the first female race driver in the United States. Cuneo also gave Disbrow his first opportunity to race. Despite his history with Cuneo, Disbrow would later let his disdain for women drivers, especially any woman who wanted to race, be known.

“Women have no business on the race track. It’s a man’s game,” said Disbrow, “and besides, I’ve seen about all the women drivers who have ever amounted to much and I've never yet seen one who could actually handle a machine the way it ought to be handled.”

When Disbrow met his wife, Harriet, in 1916, he vowed to give up racing for her — which never happen. In fact, he kept winning and setting speed records. They remained married, despite his breach of promise.



After retiring in 1929, Disbrow later became a pilot, boat builder, engineer, served as a race track official and promoted midget races.



Disbrow lost everything during the Great Depression, however. He took a Works Progress Administration job in the Philadelphia city morgue until he died — penniless — in 1939 at the age of 62.

"‘Devastated, exhausted and on edge’: More Colorado violence in Columbine’s shadow","

Students and community members hold up their phones during a vigil Wednesday in Highlands Ranch, Colo. One student was killed and eight others were injured during a school shooting at STEM Highlands Ranch. (Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images)

Tina Galterio had already bought her 7-year-old first-grader a bulletproof backpack to take to school. But after a shooting here Tuesday left one student dead and eight others injured, Galterio began researching home-school options.

“I feel so helpless,” said Galterio, 46, a graduate of Columbine High School in nearby Littleton, site of one of the most notorious school massacres in U.S. history. “I’m supposed to send my kid to school every day in a crapshoot hoping nothing happens and be grateful by the end of the day that it’s okay? This is what parents are going through in America right now.”

It’s been a “devastating” three weeks for residents of suburban Denver, as elementary school teacher Tonya West put it, with one violent calamity seemingly following another, with a manhunt, a shooting and a sober remembrance of victims of the Columbine shooting from 20 years ago.

[One student dead, eight others wounded in shooting at suburban Denver school]

At home, children are numb, refusing to eat, dreading going back to class. At school, they practice active-shooter drills and lockdowns; some parents received a notice that their children would now be drilling twice a week.

High-schoolers coped in their own ways — angrily walking out of a vigil on Wednesday night they said was politicized, then gathering for an impromptu support group at the local library Friday.

“It’s a community that’s devastated, exhausted and on edge,” said John McDonald, executive director of security and emergency management for Jefferson County Public Schools, Colorado’s second-largest district, covering a cluster of Denver’s suburbs. “People cannot wait for this year to be over.”

[The man keeping Columbine safe]

But it’s not: School districts all over the Denver area have received violent threats, with Jefferson County officials receiving 12 different reports in the past few days, he said.

The region was preparing to observe the 20th anniversary of the killings at Columbine High on April 20 when the FBI announced it was searching for an 18-year-old Florida woman who they said was “infatuated” with the massacre, was armed and in the area. The woman eventually killed herself about an hour away from the city, but not before hundreds of schools were shut down.

Then, on Tuesday, two students at the STEM Highlands Ranch charter school — about seven miles from Columbine — opened fire in classrooms, wounding several students and killing a senior, Kendrick Castillo, who tried to stop the attack.





A STEM parent, Denver-area musician Steve Holley, captured the mood when he lamented in a tweet: “There was a shooting at my son’s school today. He’s safe but . . . I’m sitting in a gym with hundreds of parents waiting to see their kids. This is the third time I’ve had to pick up my boys from school during a lockdown.”

There have been as many as nine school shootings in the area since the Columbine massacre in 1999, which left 12 students and a teacher dead. Four other major shootings have occurred within 20 miles of the suburban high school, including a 2012 shooting at a movie theater in Aurora that left 12 dead.

“If you had suggested to anybody behind me or in this room that within 20 years in 20 miles we would have dealt with Columbine, the Aurora theater, Arapahoe High School, the shooting of Zack Parrish and four other deputies, we’d have thought you mad, and yet here we are again,” District Attorney George Brauchler said at a news conference Wednesday, referencing a 2013 high school murder-suicide and a Dec. 31, 2017, attack on law enforcement officers who were responding to a domestic disturbance at the Copper Canyon Apartment Homes.

The Denver region has grown nearly 20 percent in the past decade, with newcomers drawn to its clean air, laid-back lifestyle and snowy peaks visible on the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. But residents fear that it’s becoming a magnet for dangerous individuals obsessed with Columbine shooters Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, who have spawned legions of twisted fan websites and other Internet-fueled adulation.

Peter Langman, the author of “School Shooters: Understanding High School, College and Adult Perpetrators,” estimates on his website SchoolShooters.info that 40 attackers have been directly influenced by Klebold and Harris, including the Aurora shooter.

In the long, agonizing minutes after Tuesday’s deadly shooting, Shaylynn Hall, 31, stood in the rain behind yellow police tape and strained to catch a glimpse of her third-grader, Cameron. Teachers wiped tears from little faces.

Cameron had called her from his music teacher’s cellphone to tell her that he was okay and that he hadn’t seen or heard anything during the shooting, which took place just yards away. She saw him as he prepared to board a bus to the recreation center, where parents waited to hug their children.

“I will never forget hearing his voice on that call,” Hall said. “The weight of the world was off my shoulders.”

Hall, who graduated from Columbine High in 2005, said the trauma from that event is so ingrained in her worldview that she could almost predict what would follow Tuesday’s tragedy.

“It was eerie the way things played out — it was like I knew what would happen next,” Hall said, reaching her arms out in a line. “The kids would line up and come out of the school with their hands up — including my son — and they did.”

Three days later, Hall stood at the Highlands Ranch Recreation Center on a very different mission. Nearby were piles of Gatorade, restaurant gift cards, boxes of Milk Duds, blue squishy balls, crayon drawings and handwritten notes of thanks. Volunteers placed the donations in plastic bins and teal cloth bags, each one with a white placard affixed to it with the name of a teacher or staff member in the STEM school.

Hall had placed an ad on the STEM parents’ Facebook page, drawing local business owners and retirees and kindergartners who wanted teachers and police officers to know they appreciate them. The donation drive, Hall said, is a way for her to heal and to help the community come together.

“We can choose to be scared all the time — or we can choose to do things like this,” she said, adding she wants to put the bins and bags near teacher and staff doors when the school reopens. “I want teachers to pull these cards out 10 years from now and remember that, yes, it was a horrible time, but something good came out of it, too.”

"A couple uprooted a 180-year-old oak. A judge ordered them to pay nearly $600,000.","

This undated photo provided by the Sonoma Land Trust shows a 180-year-old heritage oak tree being excavated from an easement property in Sonoma, Calif. (Crystal Simons/Sonoma Land Trust via AP)

The enormous oak tree towered high above the ground, its gnarled, moss-covered branches fanning out in every direction. For 180 years, the tree flourished undisturbed on a swath of protected land in northern California.

Then, one day, backhoes and bulldozers showed up to the wooded area owned by Toni and Peter Thompson located just north of San Francisco.

The ancient tree was going to serve a new purpose, according to recently filed court documents — decorating a nearby property where the Thompsons were building a new home.

But attempting to relocate the tree and two other heritage oaks several years ago, a process that killed the plants and extensively damaged part of the surrounding environment, would prove to be a costly move for the Thompsons.

In a recent, scathing 56-page decision, a Sonoma County judge ordered the couple to pay more than $586,000 in damages to fund restoration efforts because they “knowingly and intentionally” violated a conservation easement, an agreement that the 34-acre property must be left in its natural state.

Judge Patrick M. Broderick ruled in favor of the Sonoma Land Trust, a nonprofit responsible for enforcing easements, which sued the Thompsons over the tree removal and other environmental damage. Broderick skewered the Thompsons and accused them of repeatedly lying to members of the land trust, writing that the couple “demonstrated an arrogance and complete disregard for the mandatory terms of the Easement.”

“It was a very thoughtful, very thorough opinion that just covered all the ground that we could ask for,” Sarah H. Sigman, an attorney who represents the land trust, told The Washington Post. “This is just an egregious violation from the beginning.”

The Thompsons, however, still insist the damages to the land were not intentional, Richard Freeman, the couple’s new attorney, told The Post.

“They went into this area because they appreciated the pastoral nature of it, the scenic beauty of it,” Freeman said. “They wouldn’t have wanted to do anything that was going to cause harm, damage or scar it.”

The land trust first became aware that something wasn’t quite right on the Thompsons’ property in 2014 after a neighbor reported seeing heavy machinery on the protected land, the Sonoma Press Democrat reported.

When staff from the trust arrived for a site visit, they were stunned by what greeted them.

“I was not prepared,” Bob Neale, the trust’s stewardship director, told the Press Democrat. “It was really the most willful, egregious violation of a conservation easement I’ve ever seen.”

Portions of the area that had once been blanketed by untouched native plants were reduced to mounds of loose dirt, and others were scraped down to bedrock, according to court documents. Some photos showed a massive oak tree in a trench with its roots bound and surrounded by yellow construction equipment. A dirt road stretching for about a third of a mile was also carved through the land, destroying 12 smaller trees and other vegetation in the way, the ruling said.

“The scale of the damage done was really pretty astonishing,” Sigman told The Post. “Those oaks and those plant communities were why this land was protected, because they were special.”

She added: “There are photographs that I’ve described as apocalyptic.”

The first tree the Thompsons uprooted was the 180-year-old oak, which did not survive and was “promptly cut up and hauled away,” the ruling said. Subsequent attempts to relocate two other trees also went poorly. In one case, the oak’s roots were too tangled up in boulders to get it out of the ground and it later died. On the third try, a tree was successfully planted in the middle of the driveway of the Thompsons’ home, but it too later perished, according to the ruling.

Beyond the excavations, the Thompsons also had a contractor dredge a pond near their home and deposit the sediment on the protected land, which “introduced and fostered growth of invasive and noxious weeds,” documents said.

The land trust sent a formal notice to the Thompsons in December 2014 informing them that they had violated the easement and included actions they could take to fix their property, the court said. But while the Thompsons initially said they would work with the trust, they “repeatedly refused to engage in serious or good faith efforts toward that end,” Broderick wrote.

So the trust sued, which led to a 19-day bench trial that came to an end in September 2018.

In conversations with the land trust and throughout last year’s trial, the couple maintained that they had been trying to save the 180-year-old tree from being pruned by the local utility company because it was located near power lines.

“This was a lie,” Broderick wrote in the ruling, which was filed last month.

Documents state that the landscaping plans for the Thompsons’ home “called for two large oak trees.”

Over the course of the trial, the Thompsons offered a dozen defenses, none of which the court found had any merit. The pair were “further undermined by their persistent failure to tell the truth,” Broderick wrote.

“They sought on numerous occasions to hide their actions to avoid discovery by Trust and, once Trust learned of the violations, fabricated excuses to obstruct Trust’s investigation and avoid enforcement of the Easement against them,” the ruling said.

Freeman, who only recently started representing the couple, said they plan to push for a new trial on the grounds that the Thompsons’ previous attorney had to deal with unanticipated family emergencies, which hindered his ability to give the case all the time, energy and effort it deserved.

“The Thompsons don’t feel like they really got to fully present their evidence and tell their story,” Freeman said.

He described Broderick’s decision as “very critical” of his clients.

“They are very decent, committed, responsible, law-abiding citizens,” he said. “They just got involved in a situation improving their property that spiraled out of control and had some unfortunate results.”

PEORIA, Ill. – It's out with the old, in with the new.

The giant Abe Lincoln sculpture standing tall outside the Peoria Riverfront Museum will be replaced by a towering 25-foot-tall bronze “American Gothic” homage will be installed at 1:30 p.m. May 21, 1:30 p.m. at the museum.

The newly arriving Seward Johnson sculpture, “God Bless America,” evokes Grant Wood’s iconic painting of an Iowa farmer holding a pitchfork and standing next to his daughter. It was created by Johnson to commemorate Wood’s art and agriculture, themes which the museum will also be celebrating.

The sculpture Lincoln, “Return Visit,"" shows the president speaking to a modern-day man holding the Gettysburg Address, arrived in the fall of 2017.

“Peoria is surrounded by the world's richest and most productive farm ground,” said museum president and CEO John Morris, “For years we have stood as the Silicon Valley of agriculture technology. The Peoria Riverfront Museum is thrilled to work with Seward Johnson to bring this famous monumental bronze in gratitude for all farmers and farming does for our region and our nation.""

“We’re excited to be able to host the three-dimensional realization of Grant Wood’s masterpiece ‘American Gothic,’” said museum curator Bill Conger. “As an icon of American art, the enigmatic imagery depicts regionalist pride and Midwest determination. Along with Wood’s own artistic achievement, ‘God Bless America’ celebrates the ongoing cultivation of the greatest farmland in the world.”

“I am thrilled to have this sculpture on display at the Peoria Riverfront Museum,” said Johnson. “My Lincoln was so warmly embraced upon its arrival and I feel certain that the farmers will feel equally welcomed by this piece.” Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

The sculpture is on loan from The Seward Johnson Atelier, Inc. and was previously exhibited in Chicago, Florida, Arizona and Grant Wood’s hometown of Anamosa, Iowa.

Lakeland police look for person who spray-painted 16 buildings,"- Lakeland police are looking for the person who spray-painted graffiti throughout a busy street. They believe at least 16 businesses were hit within a two-hour period.

Saturday night, between 9 and 11, police say a man walked north for two miles on South Florida Avenue, spray painting the word ""SOLOE"" and some profanities along the way.

Debra Haskell, owner of Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Olive Branch said her sign was sprayed on both sides.

""Of course my heart sank,"" Haskell said. ""It's very disheartening as an independent business owner. We put our heart and our soul into our businesses.""

""I'm working probably 12 hours a day, 6 days a week to make my business go,"" Haskell said, ""and, somebody comes in without regard or thought to the businesses or what we do for the community.""

Continue reading below

It appears the tagger was working solo. Otherwise, his lookout might've advised him not to spray the very well-surveilled downtown bus terminal. Police hope someone recognizes him from the video.

Fortunately, Haskell was able to get the paint cleaned off. But for other small businesses, it can be a pricey fix.

""The businesses around here generally, we have a $5,000-10,000 deductible on our insurance,"" Haskell said. ""It would have been a couple thousand dollars if I had to replace those signs.""

Sean Lee, who rides the bus through Lakeland daily, enjoys the mix of historic charm and modern vibe within the city. He's disappointed that someone would try to ruin it.

""I feel very upset about it,"" Lee said. ""It's not a good thing to do, especially, with the beautification of Lakeland you know? I hope they catch the person who did this to make him pay for what he's done.""

Those who live in, or just love visiting Lakeland can't understand how anyone could do something so low.

""I hope whatever is going in that person's life, they do find help and they do find peace in their life,"" Haskell said. ""It's just unfortunate that they have such angst the local businesses.""

Police say the suspect appears to be a white male wearing a camouflage jacket with the words Levi’s printed on the sleeve and red tennis shoe. Please take a look at the photographs and if you know the identity of the suspect, call Detective David Sharrett at 863-834-8967.

The 18-year-old suspect in Tuesday’s shooting at STEM School Highlands Ranch is expected to make his first court appearance Wednesday afternoon, and the student killed days before his senior year was set to end was identified by his parents.Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock, 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler and Gov. Jared Polis hosted the news conference early Wednesday, flanked by their school and law enforcement partners, and told the northeast Colorado community reeling from another mass shooting to come together for the victims.“This does not define us. It won’t today and it won’t tomorrow,” Brauchler said, calling the latest shooting an “aberrant” act and urging the community to mourn, to support one another, and to continue to send their children to school.“Our hearts are hurting for them,” Polis said of the school community, adding that he felt “frankly sick” about the latest Colorado shooting.The authorities said that the adult suspect in the shooting, 18-year-old Devon Erickson, will likely make his first court appearance at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday.Erickson is expected to be booked on 30 counts after his first court appearance, according to Colorado court records. Those include one count of first-degree murder after deliberation and 29 counts of attempted first-degree murder.He will not face formal charges until later this week or next week should prosecutors bring them.On Wednesday morning, the parents of the 18-year-old who was killed in the shooting was identified by his parents in an interview with ABC News.Kendrick Castillo, 18, is the student killed in Tuesday's shooting, his parents said. John Castillo said his son was on the school's robotics team and shared photos of Kendrick attending prom with his friends in recent weeks. Castillo was one of nine people who were shot at the school.“I want people to know about him,” John Castillo said through tears.Spurlock said early Wednesday that he expected the county coroner to formally identify the victim killed in the shooting.Spurlock said Wednesday morning that of the eight students who were shot and injured, three remained hospitalized. All three were in intensive care at area hospitals, Spurlock said, but the other six victims had been released. Authorities said Tuesday all of the victims were age 15 or over.Spurlock adjusted what he said Tuesday and said the juvenile suspect in the shooting, whose name and age has not been released, was a female. He originally said the suspect was male on Tuesday, but said Wednesday that officials originally thought the suspect was male by their “appearance.”Sources told Denver7 late Tuesday that the juvenile suspect is in the process of transitioning from female to male.Brauchler said he was unsure if the juvenile would face their first advisement Wednesday and said it was too early to say whether his office would pursue adult charges.He also urged people to focus on the victims of the shooting rather than the alleged shooters and to remember that the suspects are presumed innocent until proven otherwise.Spurlock said that there were “very heroic things that took place” at the school Tuesday and said at least one student encountered the suspects and worked to stop them. He said he had also reviewed video from inside the school showing other heroic acts involving Douglas County deputies and staffers and students at the school.He described the incident between the student and the alleged shooters as an “encounter” but said he could not elaborate further.Spurlock said that there were no shots exchanged between officers who responded to the shooting and the alleged shooters and said both suspects were taken into custody. He said he believed one of the suspects had already been restrained by the school’s armed private security officer when deputies got to them. He said the two suspects were not taken into custody at the same location inside the school. The school does not have school resource officers but does employ private, armed security.Spurlock confirmed that at least two handguns were used in the shooting. High-ranking sources told Denver7 Tuesday night that three handguns and a rifle were recovered but said the rifle was not used in the shooting.Spurlock said officials were working with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to determine how the suspects were able to obtain the guns. He said he could not comment on whether the suspects were talking with law enforcement.Sources told Denver7 Tuesday that the motive of the alleged shooters went beyond bullying and involved revenge and anger toward others at the school and that at least one of the suspects was involved in legal and illegal drug use and had been in therapy. But Spurlock said Wednesday the incident was “too new” to establish a motive. Tuesday's shooting is the first since Columbine in which two shooters were involved.Spurlock said he could not discuss a possible motive at Wednesday’s news conference but said authorities were “deep” in social media searches and analysis of the suspects’ phones and computers. They are also continuing to interview witnesses, which Spurlock said would still take some time because around 600 of the 1,800 students at the K-12 school were directly affected by the shooting.Spurlock confirmed that a car seen taken from the home of Erickson on Tuesday night, which had graffiti spray-painted onto it that read, “F--- society,” was being analyzed as evidence but said he had no specific information on the graffiti.Police were called to the school in Highlands Ranch just before 2 p.m. Tuesday . Spurlock said that deputies were at the school two minutes after the initial call, and praised the work of first responders to the scene.STEM School Highlands Ranch will be closed for at least the rest of the week, the district said Tuesday night. Other Douglas County schools are open Wednesday but have extra security on-site. There are grief counselors available for the STEM community at the school, and there will be a crisis support center available to all STEM School students and families at the St. Andrew United Methodist Church in Highlands Ranch starting at 8 a.m.The district is asking for new or gently used blankets to be donated for STEM students, staff and families to give out at the crisis support center. Anyone who wishes to donate can drop the blankets off at the school district's building, located at 620 Wilcox Street in Castle Rock, between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. Wednesday.Friday was set to be the last day of school for the STEM seniors, which included Castillo, who had his life taken Tuesday, as well as the 18-year-old man accused of forever disrupting the lives of so many others.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/colorado-school-shooting/27396854,2019-05-08T17:08:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA"

St. Petersburg, FLA - It's very likely you've never heard of ""toe tagging,"" but it's a potentially deadly game played out on the streets of St. Petersburg.

it almost cost a young man his life.

The young victim is going to have to learn how to walk again. The crash shattered his hip. His fiance blames a stupid game called ""toe tagging.""

Early Sunday morning at MLK and Jasmine Way in St. Petersburg, TWO cars hit head-on.

The impact crushed Leonard ""L.A.” Hills’ Camry and sent him to the emergency room at Bayfront Health.

“He's not doing too good. He's in a lot of pain. His hip, he can't really move the left side of his bottom too much without having guidance,” said his fiancé, T'angela Carbart.

She said this crash is the result of ""toe tagging.""

“They have a line full of cars where they go down the streets and they race through red lights. They'll try to swerve between traffic. It all depends on who can beat who,” she explained.

It's a big game of what used to be called ""chicken.""

“Who is the fasted car that can get in the front of the line. And who can dodge cars in and out of traffic,” said Carbart.

St. Petersburg police cited the other driver, a 17-year-old, for being on the wrong side of the road.

“Was two cars. They were racing. That's what he said. He believed the other car was going about 100 mph. 'Cause he was going about 40,” said Carbart.

At the crash scene, bits of glass, crime scene tape and scuffed pavement mark the spot where the cars collided.

While St. Petersburg police aren't pointing their fingers at toe tagging, Carbart is convinced, and she has a message to young people who participate.

“Toe tagging is not a good thing. It is not fun. It's not exciting. It doesn't give you a thrill. It can kill you. It can harm you and other people,” she said.

L.A. Hills has a long rehab ahead, plus a wedding and being a dad to his 2-year-old daughter.

A St. Petersburg police spokeswoman said the definition of ""toe tagging"" seems to depend on who you ask.

A YouTube video describes it as young girls driving around town after a party.

In this case, it may have happened after a prom.",http://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/toe-tagging-crash-may-be-cause-of-bad-crash-in-st-petersburg/1987407777,2019-05-08T01:48:30Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"
Carjacking victim says tougher procedures needed after attacker's mistaken release,"When Amy Rowe was carjacked in the driveway of her Apopka home in 2017 by Cedric Gant and his fully-loaded AK-47, she had never been more terrified. Until Gant was mistakenly released from jail in April.

For three days, over Easter weekend, Gant was a free man.

A Brevard County judge sentenced Gant to time served for a misdemeanor warrant and released him.

The judge didn't know Gant had a federal hold on his record.

""They never contacted me, so I found out about this the Saturday after he released, because the other victim came to me,"" Rowe said. ""I couldn't sleep. I was scared, I know my kids were scared. I was more anxious than I was this past year and a half because I didn't know if he was going to come after me.""

Gant had been convicted in federal court of Rowe's carjacking and another armed carjacking and was headed to federal prison to serve a 23-year sentence.

But the paperwork that the Brevard County judge saw did not show a hold.

Brevard County Sheriff's Office spokesman Tod Goodyear said the Brevard County judge did not make a mistake.

""He [the judge] only handled the Brevard case that he [Gant] appeared on,"" Goodyear said. ""The judge would have nothing to do with the Federal case. He is not at fault.""

Goodyear said the Brevard County Sheriff's Office, which runs the jail, is conducting a review.

The mistake was made by an employee at the Lake County Jail.

Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman John Herrell said the employee ""misread"" Gant's hold information and was suspended for one day without pay for the mistake.

The Lake County Jail employee received an email from a corrections release specialist at the Orange County Jail advising that Gant ""has satisfied local charges and does not need to be returned to our agency"" and to ""release our holds only.""

The specialist instructed Lake County that Gant ""still does have holds for Lake County [carjacking] case #17CF002594.""

Still, the Lake County Jail employee signed a hold order stating Gant was wanted by no other agencies.

""They could've emailed someone, they could have called someone, they could've called the marshal's office,"" Rowe said. ""It only took another two minutes for somebody to say, listen, there are holds on this guy let me make sure I'm taking the right holds off. Because we double, triple check at my job. I don't understand why one person would be in charge of removing holds.""



Rowe said there was no need for Gant to be transferred to Brevard County to answer for a misdemeanor warrant after he had been sentenced to federal prison for 23 years.

""There was an unneeded transition,"" Rowe said. ""If he didn't need to go to Lake County or Brevard maybe this wouldn't have happened. That's one thing I don't understand. Why he needed to get rid of those charges to start his sentence.""

Rowe said she's considering hiring a victims' rights attorney because she believes her rights as a victim were violated.

""I get it, I understand that it's a mistake, we all make mistakes and misread things,"" Rowe said. ""But the fact that I was never contacted to say this guy's getting out. The fact that no one's ever called me to say we are so sorry.""

Rowe wants jails to toughen their inmate transfer and release procedures.

""I want them to seriously look at what they're doing,"" Rowe said. ""This is holding a gun to somebody's face. Threatening their life. And taking their property.

'Buffy' actor charged in 2017 Palm Springs assault involving girlfriend,"CLOSE 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' actor Nicholas Brendon was arrested in Tallahassee on Friday after police say he caused as much as $1,000 in damage to his hotel room. While speaking about the arrest, he revealed secrets from his troubled past. VPC

A felony count of domestic violence has been filed against an actor best known for playing Xander Harris in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""

The charge against Nicholas Brendon, 48, stems from an October 2017 incident involving a girlfriend at a Palm Springs hotel on East Palm Canyon Drive.

Palm Springs police had reported Brendon was with his girlfriend when they got into an argument and he pulled her arm and then pulled her by her hair.

Hotel employees notified police about the incident, which resulted in ""a traumatic condition upon Jane Doe,"" according to a criminal complaint.

The victim had protective orders against Brendon in New York and Florida and he was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and violating a protective order.

He was booked into the Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility in Banning and released a day later after posting $50,000 bail.

If convicted, Brendon faces up to four years in prison.

The Palm Springs incident followed a series of arrests dating to at least October 2014, when Brendon was accused of causing a disturbance at a Boise, Idaho, hotel.

Brendon was arrested in February 2015 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after he caused extensive damage to a hotel room. A month later, he was arrested in Tallahassee, Florida, on similar charges. He was charged with damage to property and criminal mischief.

In an interview with the Tallahassee Democrat, Brendon characterized the incident as a ""blackout"" after taking nine sleeping pills.

In September 2015, Brendon appeared on an episode of Dr. Phil, where he openly discussed his struggle with depression and alcohol addiction, saying that drinking ""initially quells the anxiety definitely, but then it just adds to the anger.""

'Serial convenience-store robbery suspect' sought,"- The Volusia County Sheriff’s Office is hoping to identify a man described as a ""serial convenience-store robbery suspect.""

The same suspect is believed to be responsible for four robberies at 24-hour stores in the south end of Deltona since February, plus possibly two more in Seminole County. In each case, the suspect either brandished a weapon or implied he had one.

The latest incident occurred around 2 a.m. Monday morning at the 7-Eleven at 839 DeBary Ave., Deltona. It’s believed to be the second time the same suspect robbed that store.

The other robberies in Volusia County occurred at a Circle K store 1712 Doyle Road and a Cumberland Farms store at 1251 Providence Blvd. No injuries were reported in these cases.

After each robbery, it’s believed the suspect left the store on foot. It’s unknown at this time if he eventually entered a vehicle or if he remained on foot.

The suspect is described as a black man, between 17 to 25 years of age, with a thin build, 5 feet, 8 inches to 6 feet tall, weighing 140 to 170 pounds.

If you have any information or additional surveillance footage that might lead to an arrest in these cases, please contact the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office at 386-860-7030 or Detective J. Paul at 386-801-9162.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/-serial-convenience-store-robbery-suspect-sought,2019-05-07T02:53:46Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA"
Trump pardons former US soldier who killed Iraqi prisoner,"- President Donald Trump has pardoned a former U.S. soldier convicted in 2009 of killing an Iraqi prisoner, the White House announced Monday.

Trump signed an executive grant of clemency, a full pardon, for former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna, of Oklahoma, press secretary Sarah Sanders said.

Behenna was convicted of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone after killing a suspected al-Qaida terrorist in Iraq. He was paroled in 2014 and had been scheduled to remain on parole until 2024.

A military court had sentenced Behenna to 25 years in prison. However, the Army's highest appellate court noted concern about how the trial court had handled Behenna's claim of self-defense, Sanders said. The Army Clemency and Parole Board also reduced his sentence to 15 years and paroled him as soon as he was eligible.

Behenna's case attracted broad support from the military, Oklahoma elected officials and the public, Sanders said. She added that Behenna was a model prisoner while serving his sentence, and ""in light of these facts, Mr. Behenna is entirely deserving"" of the pardon.

Behenna acknowledged during his trial that instead of taking the prisoner home as he was ordered, he took the man to a railroad culvert, stripped him, and then questioned him at gunpoint about a roadside bombing that had killed two members of Behenna's platoon.

Behenna, a native of the Oklahoma City suburb of Edmond, said the man moved toward him and he shot him because Behenna thought he would try to take his gun.

Oklahoma's attorney general first requested a pardon for Behenna in February 2018 and renewed his request last month. Attorney General Mike Hunter said he believed Behenna's conviction was unjustified because of erroneous jury instructions and the failure of prosecutors to turn over evidence supporting a self-defense claim.",http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/u-s-and-world-news/trump-pardons-former-us-soldier-who-killed-iraqi-prisoner,2019-05-07T01:42:05Z,FOX 35 ORLANDO,"35 Skyline Dr, Lake Mary, FL 32746, USA"
Florida woman pulls alligator from her pants during traffic stop: report,"A Florida woman reportedly pulled an alligator out of her pants during a traffic stop on Monday — a strange move that might just rank on the state's list of odd reported crimes.

Ariel Machan-Le Quire, 25, was in the passenger's seat of a vehicle around 3:30 a.m. in Punta Gorda when she was pulled over, the Miami Herald reported, citing an incident report from the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office.

The department said that the woman was asked if she had anything else in the vehicle, and then “proceeded to pull an alligator out of her yoga pants (about one foot in length) and placed it into the bed of the truck.""

Machan-Le Quire, along with 22-year-old driver Michael Clemons, claimed they were trying to collect wildlife from underneath an overpass. Investigators said the woman also had 41 small turtles inside of a backpack.

A man who told police he stomped on a Cape Coral man's head with the bottom of his foot rather than the heel because he ""didn't want to kill him"" is facing aggravated assault charges.

A confrontation between the two over access to a home resulted in the man being severely beaten.

Cape Coral police went to a home in the 1200 block of SE 21st Street shortly after 6 a.m. Saturday on a report of a disturbance and an unconscious man.

Officers said when they arrived the victim was standing in front of the residence with a large amount of blood on his face, body, and arms. His left eye was swollen nearly closed, police said.

A police report said that the victim’s live-in girlfriend has had her brother, Michael Lee Capobianco, 40, Cape Coral, stay with them after he was kicked out of a Southeast 21st home of their parents.

Because the parents were out of town she was having her boyfriend go to their house to feed the dog.

After the boyfriend entered the home, he found Capobianco already inside and confronted him at the front door, telling Capobianco that he is not allowed at the residence and had to leave.

Capobianco attacked his sister's boyfriend, punching him numerous times in the head and body. Police said he then placed the boyfriend in a choke hold causing the victim to lose consciousness. He then kicked him in the face and head several times.

Copabianco told police ""I didn't want to kill him so I used the bottom of my foot and not my heal,"" and ""I didn't use lethal force, so that's good, right?""

Police did not release the victim's name.

Deputies: Man claims demons made him batter pregnant woman in Hudson,"HUDSON, Fla. (WFLA) - A Pasco County man who was arrested for battering a pregnant woman claims demons took over his body and made him do it, deputies say.

Pasco deputies arrested 26-year-old Matthew Douglas Saturday night at his home in Hudson.

Deputies were called to the home around 10:30 to investigate a domestic battery call. When they got to the scene, deputies say Douglas refused to cooperate and wouldn't state his name.

Douglas was detained and put in the back of a patrol car. He later provided his name and admitted he didn't want to cooperate originally because he knew there was a warrant out for his arrest, deputies say.

According to the arrest report, Douglas told deputies demons took over his body and made him black out. He said that may have led him to become physical with his the pregnant woman, deputies noted in the report.

The victim, who is 18 weeks pregnant, told deputies she was playing Xbox Saturday night when Douglas told her to go to sleep. Douglas turned the game system off, but the victim turned it back on.

That's when the victim says Douglas grabbed her around the neck and started to choke her, the arrest report says. The victim told deputies she couldn't breathe and was scared. Deputies noted in the arrest report that the victim had a small area of bruising on her neck and three long scratch marks.

Douglas was charged with domestic aggravated battery on a pregnant female.

Sheriff's Office: Wanted Florida man hoped blonde wig would disguise him from deputies as he biked away,"Moral of the story from sheriff's office: Above all else DO NOT wear a hideous wig while trying to run from the Po/Po on a bicycle.

A Florida fugitive wanted on drug charges tried to elude deputies surrounding the home he was in Thursday by donning a long blonde wig and riding off on a bicycle, the Brevard County Sheriff's Office said.

The wig didn't work, and agents caught up with and arrested Robert “Bobby” Walls soon after watching him ride away, deputies said.

Walls later admitted he put the wig on in hopes that officers wouldn't recognize him and that he'd avoid arrest, deputies said.

Investigators had set up a perimeter around the residence after getting a tip he was there. Walls' warrant was one of over 100 in ""a significant drug investigation"" by the sheriff's office.

Walls was charged with conspiracy to possess controlled substance, solicitation to sell controlled substance, and unlawful use of a two-way device.

So here is the moral of the story,"" the sheriff's office posted on its Facebook page.

"How did Titans decide on Jeffery Simmons? Research, calculated risk and a lot of faith","PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE PHOTOS. MARCIA HAS PICKED THEM.

They could have traded down. They could have traded up. They could have drafted someone else, someone without significant red flags on his resume or someone who wouldn’t have had general manager Jon Robinson almost immediately going on the defensive in his explanation of the pick.

But the Titans couldn’t resist.

They selected Jeffery Simmons. Big and athletic. Strong and agile. Mississippi State-forged and SEC-tested. The ultra-talented, do-it-all defensive tackle. But yes, there was a reason the 6-foot-4, 301-pounder was still on the board when the Titans were on the clock with the 19th pick in the 2019 NFL Draft. Two, actually: a reprehensible incident in high school and a recently torn ACL.

Robinson has made 29 picks since being named the team’s general manager in January 2016; this was the one he had to answer for most.

Amy Adams Strunk has been the Titans' controlling owner since March 2015; this, she said, was the most she’s been involved in drafting a player.

So how did the Titans arrive at the controversial decision to draft the 21-year-old native of LaSalle Parish, La.? There’s a ton to unpack, but once you do, it’s really quite simple.

They have faith in his talent.

They have faith in his comeback from injury.

They have faith in him.

A horrific mistake, an isolated incident

The police report tells part of the story. In it, police Officer Carlos Hill details Sophia Taylor’s 911 call about 6:30 p.m. March 24, 2016, in which Taylor recounts the incident that occurred in the parking lot at Mayfair Apartments in Macon, Miss.

Taylor and Ashley Bradley, Simmons' sister, exchanged verbal jabs.Then physical ones. That's when Simmons, his mother, Brenda Bradley, and Ashley's boyfriend, Keith McCloung, got involved.

The video, captured via cellphone by an onlooker, tells another part. In it, a 17-year-old Simmons is seen striking Taylor at least five times.

It went viral. Simmons, who said he intervened only when Taylor brought up his sister's dead children by saying ""(expletive) you and your dead kids,"" was found guilty of malicious mischief. He pleaded no contest to simple assault and paid fines and restitution for the woman’s medical bills.

""My first reaction was actually breaking up the fight, (but) she ended up saying it again,"" Simmons said. ""I just let my emotions take over. I wasn’t even thinking about the consequences. ... The day of the incident I was so in shock that I didn’t even – I was still in shock like, ‘Did I really just do this?’""

People close to Simmons emphasize his closeness to his family and how he'd do anything to protect them.

""He lived at home with his mom during his sophomore and junior years (at Mississippi State),"" said Gary Naylor, a friend of the family. ""Him, a five-star (prospect), living at home! That tells you everything.""

But this was way out of character.

""What people don't realize and don't understand, that situation had been going on for years and years and years,"" said Tyrone Shorter, Simmons' high school football coach at Noxubee County, who has known Simmons since Simmons was in fifth grade. ""It had nothing to do with Jeffery, and he just got dragged into all that situation.""

Strunk said she watched the video of the incident with Robinson and Titans coach Mike Vrabel as part of their vetting process. That process included talking “extensively” with “countless people” about the incident and Simmons' history.

It wasn’t the first time Simmons had been evaluated in such fashion.

In 2016, former Mississippi State athletics director Scott Stricklin estimated he spoke with dozens of people to gauge Simmons’ character and determine whether the incident was, in fact, an isolated occurrence.

Teachers. Coaches. Principals. People Simmons had gone to church with. Community leaders. Anyone close.

""He has his issue, and we dug into that, as I know the Titans did, and it's a singular issue,"" said Stricklin, now the athletics director at Florida. ""Candidly, you're almost looking for a reason not to stand by him. You're looking for any reason.""

Stricklin, who handed down a one-game suspension to Simmons – though he admitted he still isn't sure whether that was the appropriate punishment – said he never found one.

""You see a lot of young people wanting to cast blame or make excuses, and Jeffrey never has done that,"" Stricklin said.

Shorter echoed that sentiment. So did Holli Jenkins, Simmons' assistant principal and athletics director at Noxubee County, who called Simmons accountable and said he was the quintessential student-athlete.

So did current Mississippi State athletics director John Cohen, who said, ""At Mississippi State, he has been a model citizen in every way.""

Same for Mississippi State associate athletics director Bill Martin, who said, ""He made a terrible mistake. He owned that mistake. But a five-second video will not define Jeff Simmons. It didn't define him in his three years here at Mississippi State.""

Robinson said it took time for the idea of Simmons in Nashville to grow on him, but each positive testimonial moved him closer to becoming comfortable.

""Trust me, I’ve gone around with it in my head,"" Robinson said.

What stands out most to Vrabel?

""He doesn’t hide behind it. He stands up like a grown man and he owns it,"" the Titans coach said. ""This is a good guy. This is a great guy who made a horrific mistake.""

Ultimately, though, Strunk had the final say.

Her support – ""You can talk, ‘I’m sorry,' but the best thing is, is that he’s lived the life of, ‘I’m truly sorry and I’m going to be a good man,'"" she said – left Simmons in tears.

""Just to hear her say all that,"" he said, ""I’m grateful.""

A setback – but only a temporary one

It happened during a routine agility drill, one Simmons said he’d done hundreds of times.

Just bad luck.

Dr. Rusty Linton, the head orthopedic surgeon for Mississippi State’s football team, performed the surgery Feb. 19. The timetable for return from an ACL tear is about nine months, meaning if everything goes right, Simmons could have some impact this season.

But at the very least, he's going to miss a significant portion of 2019. But, Cohen will tell you, that's part of why he was such a steal.

""I think that in some ways, down the road, Nashville's going to be happy that – and I know this is going to sound crazy – but they're going to be happy that he got injured,"" the Mississippi State athletics director said, ""because he would not have been the 19th pick had he not gotten injured. I mean I'm convinced he would have gone a long time before that.""

Still, this is a team in win-now mode. Three straight 9-7 seasons have a Titans fan base restless.

That Simmons won't be able to contribute immediately wasn't a deterrent, Robinson said.

""We’ve talked through all of that,"" Robinson said, ""and at the end of the day we felt like our doctors and the trainers that evaluated the injury, just like they evaluate every injury, and we felt like whenever he’s able to get back out there that he’s going to be a really impactful player for our defense.""

So does Mississippi State coach Joe Moorhead, who has been able to keep an eye on Simmons while he goes through the early stages of his rehab in Starkville.

""I know how Jeffery is going to attack the rehabilitation process,"" said Moorhead, who was hired after the 2017 season and coached Simmons during his junior season. ""And I know his desire to get back on the field.""

To Moorhead's point, Mississippi State head athletic trainer Thomas Callans knows Simmons to be fiercely dedicated when it comes to training and, in this case, rehab.

During a 17-day stretch before the draft, Simmons had a long list of NFL visits that interrupted his rehab. No matter. He went through stretches and exercises in hotel rooms and, in some instances, improvised.

""We were communicating over those NFL visits,"" Callans said, ""and he texted me one day and said, 'Hey, I just kind of had a change of schedule and I'm going to be back in town and free Sunday morning. You want to come in?' And I said, 'Absolutely.' So he came in and did as much as he could during that one day that he was back and then hit the road again, off to his next visit. There's his work ethic.""

Too good to pass up

CBS Sports gave the Titans an ‘A’ for the pick. So did Pro Football Focus. So did NFL.com. In fact, good luck finding anyone that gave them lower than a B-plus.

""Some of the stuff he can do, man..."" said Shorter, Simmons' high school coach.

All of that stuff had many analysts labeling Simmons a top-10 talent in this year's draft. Some even said top-five.

That's what Moorhead thought.

""I think he's a guy who can be a perennial Pro Bowl player,"" the Mississippi State coach said, ""just because he's a combination of tangibles and intangibles. He's got size. He's got strength. He's got speed. He's got athletic ability. He can play the run. He can play the pass. And he also understands the process relative to preparation that what you do during the week is going to dictate how you play on Sundays.""

The two-time All-SEC first-teamer won't hit the field right away. But whenever he does?

""He's going to be a beast,"" Titans four-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Jurrell Casey said. And if so, that would make two beasts along the Titans' defensive line.

CLOSE “He’s going to be a big factor for this defense,"" Titans defensive tackle Jurrell Casey said about the team's first-round pick, Jeffery Simmons. Erik Bacharach, USA TODAY NETWORK – Tennessee

And so while the decision came down to talent, it goes back to faith. In that regard, nothing was stronger than Strunk's ringing endorsement of Simmons.

""We’re getting a great football player, that goes without saying, but we’re (also) getting a great man,"" she said.

That's when Simmons, through streaming tears, uttered a phrase that's become something of a personal mantra.

""(I’ll) tell her in front of you guys that she can trust me,"" Simmons said to reporters during his introductory press conference. ""I won’t let her down.""

It's exactly what he told Robinson when he found out he was about to be drafted by the Titans.

"Stocks down again after Trump says China ""broke the deal""","Stocks fell again on Thursday amid heightened concerns about a growing trade war between China and the U.S., following President Trump's comment on Wednesday that he wants to raise tariffs on Chinese imports because the country ""broke the deal."" The comment comes ahead of a deadline on Friday to raise tariffs if a deal isn't reached.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 296 points, or 1.1 percent, to 25,671 in early trading. Other indices were also lower, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, which declined 1 percent, and the S&P 500, which slipped about 0.9 percent.

The negative tone that has gripped markets this week was triggered by a threat from Mr. Trump to go ahead with plans to impose more tariffs on Chinese goods this Friday. The U.S. government has filed plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent. The Trump administration has also threatened to extend 25 percent tariffs to another $325 billion in Chinese imports, covering everything China ships to the United States.

The global markets have shed $1.36 trillion between Mr. Trump tweet on Sunday to boost tariffs on Sunday and Wednesday, according to a Bloomberg calculation. Mr. Trump's comments at his rally added to the anxiety felt by investors, who are concerned an escalating trade war will crimp economic growth and eat into corporate profits.

""[T]he vice premier tomorrow is flying in — good man — but they broke the deal,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to Liu He, China's chief negotiator, at a Florida rally on Thursday evening, according to Axios. ""They can't do that, so they'll be paying.""

On Thursday, Beijing said it will impose ""necessary countermeasures"" if the increases take effect as planned, the ministry said. It gave no details but a ministry spokesman said Beijing has made ""all necessary preparations,"" suggesting it might be bracing for worsening conflict.

Sen. Mike Braun says Trump is bringing China closer to trade deal

Such moves would mark a sharp escalation in the trade dispute that has raised prices on goods for consumers and companies.

Negotiations

Negotiations are scheduled to continue in Washington on Thursday, and to include China's top trade official, raising some hopes in the markets that there will be a last-minute deal to prevent another round of tariffs.

""With representatives from both sides meeting for a final time ahead of tomorrow's potential tariffs increase, many will see Trump's tone as yet another move in a high-stakes chess game which clearly has further to run,"" said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG.

The possibility that the dispute could escalate represents a marked shift from just a few weeks ago, when talks between the U.S. and China appeared to be on track for an agreement. Hopes for a deal contributed to double-digit gains in all the major indexes so far this year.

The U.S. and China have already raised tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each other's goods in their dispute over U.S. complaints about Beijing's industrial and technology policies and a perennial U.S. deficit in trade with China.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stocks-down-again-today-after-trump-says-china-broke-the-deal-2019-05-09/,2019-05-09T14:00:15Z,CBS News,"524 West 57th Street New York, NY 10019"
Skirmish at North Fort Myers community over veteran's Vietnam War memorial mural settled ... unhappily,"A skirmish between residents and management at a North Fort Myers development involving a memorial to the Vietnam War ended peacefully if not unhappily Tuesday.

The issue arose seemingly overnight when residents of the Del Tura Golf & Country Club began talking on social media sites about a mural on a garage door painted in black and depicting a Vietnam War-era soldier kneeling before a cross with a helicopter flying in the background.

Community officials sent Bob Masson, 71, a Vietnam War vet and the mural's owner, a letter asking him to remove the depiction. Apparently there also had been a complaint.

""It feels like I've been kicked in the head,"" Masson said. ""It feels like (his service in the war) meant nothing right now. It meant a lot to us when we were over there.""

Tuesday morning a group of residents gathered at the Del Tura clubhouse parking lot and started discussing the issue, which they said they thought was all about the military content of the mural.

Del Tura is a 55-and-over manufactured homes community on U.S. 41 in North Fort Myers.

""There's a lot of military veterans in here,"" Don Beavers, 60 and a veteran, said. ""It was on NextDoor and it just blew up yesterday. Everyone got involved last night.""

NextDoor is a social media site that developments such as Del Tura, gated communities and local communities can join to find out goings-on for their specific areas.

Richard Dzedzej, a resident at Del Tura, said the homeowner is a Vietnam veteran and was going to comply with the letter he received and paint over the picture.

""Other veterans told him that there is nothing wrong with it and to leave it intact,"" Dzedzej said.

Eventually Fred Taylor, the community manager, came out and addressed the residents.

""I'm happy to answer questions,"" Taylor told them. ""But not with the news present.""

Taylor told the group before moving inside the clubhouse that he was unaware they would be coming to meet with him with the news media present.

When questioned about the letter Taylor said Masson had not sought the proper approval despite community rules that disallow any mural on a garage door.

""I explained it is not the content of the graphic,"" Taylor said before asking the residents to meet with him in private. ""It is any graphic.""

Taylor pointed out that the community flies a POW flag on its main flagpole.

After the meeting the residents said they were satisfied but some were still a bit rankled that it was handled the way it was.

""I consider it unhappily settled,"" Dzedzej said. ""I understand the point but do think they could have let him keep it.""

Dzedzej's son Mike doesn't live at Del Tura but was visiting with his veteran dad and wasn't happy either.

""I think it's nonsense that he has to take it down,"" he said.

Masson, who has a flagpole with the POW and U.S. flags flying, and statues of military figures on his front lawn in basically the same configuration as the mural, said he put up the mural three months ago.

""I'm a military man all the way,"" Masson said. ""I'm just appalled that I have to take this off. It took them three months to send me the letter. But I see their point, they have a job to do.""

He said he was told he could keep the mural until Memorial Day and then replace it with a flag of the same topic or a plexiglass depiction and place it alongside the house. He said the brief battle won't prompt him to move.

""I have a lot of good friends, veterans, behind me 100 percent. I'm very disappointed,"" he said. ""But I'll get over it. ... I'll bite the bullet.""

2019 Marks the 25th Anniversary for the Kyle Petty Charity Ride, and this year is the longest route yet. A 3,700 mile journey benefitting a camp known as Victory Junction.



""Victory Junction is a camp that we built when my oldest son, Adam, was killed in 2000. Its for children with chronic or life threatening illnesses. We've seen 30,000 kids.

""Im a very big advocate of motorcyles. I love motorcycles, but I thought to ride across the coutntry they were absolutely lost their mind. But then I realized what Victory Junction really was and what it really meant, and I got into it. And I've absolutely loved it. The people here.. everyone here is like family. And whats so amazing is that I've started here like 15 years ago and most of the people I've started with are still riding today,"" said Herschel Walker.



""It's been very successful. I guess this is the grand finale from the stand point this is the furthest that we've ever been so he wanted to make something special out of the 25th year,"" said Richard Petty.

The route began in Seattle and ends in Key Largo, Florida. 3,700 miles in just five days... with a few stops along the way to greet fans and sign autographs.

""Dinner. No you know... Its good.

""They'll see that theres no difference. That they're normal. And I love to see that... I love to see a kid smile and thats what makes me want to keep coming back to do this,"" said Herschel Walker.

St. Petersburg, FLA - It's very likely you've never heard of ""toe tagging"", but its a potentially deadly game played out on the streets of St. Petersburg.

And it almost cost a young man, his life.

The young victim is going to have to learn how to walk again. The crash shattered his hip. His fiance blames a stupid game called ""toe tagging.""

Early Sunday morning, M.L.K. and Jasmine Way in St. Petersburg, 2 cars hit head-on.

The impact crushed Leonard ""L.A.” Hills’ Camry and sent him to the emergency room at Bayfront Health.

“He's not doing too good. He's in a lot of pain. His hip, he can't really move the left side of his bottom too much without having guidance” said his fiancé, T'angela Carbart.

She said this crash is the result of ""toe tagging.""

“They have a line full of cars where they go down the streets and they race through red lights. They'll try to swerve between traffic. It all depends on who can beat who” she explained.

It's a big game of what used to be called ""chicken."" “Who is the fasted car that can get in the front of the line. And who can dodge cars in and out of traffic” said Carbart.

St. Petersburg police cited the other driver, a 17-year-old, for being on the wrong side of the road. “Was 2 cars. They were racing. That's what he said. He believed the other car was going about a hundred miles per hour. Cuz he was going about 40” said Carbart.

At the crash scene, bits of glass, crime scene tape and scuffed pavement, mark the spot where the cars collided.

While St. Petersburg Police aren't pointing their fingers at toe tagging, Carbart is convinced, and she has a message to young people who participate.

“Toe tagging is not a good thing. It is not fun. It's not exciting. It doesn't give you a thrill. It can kill you. It can harm you and other people” she said.

“L.A. Hills has a long rehab ahead, plus a wedding, and being a dad to his 2 year old daughter.

A St. Petersburg Police spokeswoman said the definition of ""toe tagging"" seems to depend on who you ask. A YouTube video describes it as young girls driving around town after a party.

Thompson sentenced to life for murder and robbery of Allen Johnson in 2014,"Thompson sentenced to life for murder and robbery of Allen Johnson in 2014 Video

PANAMA CITY, Fla. -- Derrick Ray Thompson, convicted of first-degree felony murder and robbery with a firearm on Friday and now sentenced to life in prison.

""Feel like we've been kicked in the stomach a little bit,"" said Kim Limmer, niece/ sister of Allen Johnson.

Allen Johnson's family sat in the courtroom as Thompson was given two life sentences for the murder and robbery of Johnson in 2014.

""We thought for sure it was going to be more towards the death penalty,"" said Johnson's sister Vicki Wood.

Limmer addressed the court and Thompson after the sentence was announced by the clerk.

""I have to live with what you have done for the rest of my life,"" said Limmer when asked if she had anything to say to Thompson.

Limmer's husband, Mark, said, ""without as much as an apology.""

Thompson was previously sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a couple in Milton, Florida and Wood says Thompson acted the same in both cases.

Wood said, ""He never stood up. Not even at Milton or stood up here to address the families, to say anything in reference to say anything to killing the friends of his.""

The state was seeking the death penalty in this case. Under state constitutional changes, the decision had to be unanimous to give that sentence.

The family says they even though they didn't get the decision they wanted, they're appreciative of the state for their hard work. They say, no matter what, they will continue to honor Allen Johnson.

Limmer says the way Johnson was killed is a tragedy but she wants him to be remembered as a kind, sweet and caring man who loved everyone.

Over the two cases, Thompson will serve four life sentences consecutively in the Florida Department of Corrections.",https://www.mypanhandle.com/don-t-miss/thompson-sentenced-to-life-for-murder-and-robbery-of-allen-johnson-in-2014/1987247207,2019-05-07T23:18:49Z,MYPANHANDLE,"613 Harrison Ave, Panama City, FL 32401, USA"
Blue-green algae suffocating part of Sarasota County's Lemon Bay,"- Blue-green algae, moving in large clumps, is littering the offshore waterways of Sarasota County.

It's not the exact type of cyanobacteria algae that bloomed in Lake Okeechobee but this algae comes with its own bad side effects.

In Lake O, the blue-green sludge was caused by the microcystis cyanobacteria. At Indian Mound Park in Englewood, in the waters of Lemon Bay, it's a form of cyanobacteria called Lyngbya wollei.

Fisherman Terry Kennan says, regardless of the name difference, he is watching where he casts his line.

""I wouldn't let any kids or animals near that stuff. I don’t think it’s healthy to be around that particular bloom,"" he said.

Continue reading below

The Florida Department of Health agrees. Cyanobacteria causes cyanotoxins which can cause skin rashes, lesions, respiratory irritation, and if ingested, intestinal problems. it can even kill animals that drink contaminated water.

RELATED: Florida's toxic algae crisis: Toxins found in air concern researchers

The Florida Department of Environmental Protection said cyanobacteria like what's being seen at Indian Mound Park is common in Florida, but Kennan said he's never seen it this bad.

After a horrible bout of red tide and witnessing similar algae problems in Indiana, he's concerned.

""Man is not going to survive. We have to have clean water... We have to spend some of our tax dollars on resolving these blooms. It has to be done. The money has to spent,"" he said.

Further north, in Osprey, a small patch remains at Blackburn Point Park.

""It's really messy. It almost looks like sewage coming in. It’s ugly looking,"" said Don Nelson.

The algae form large, brownish floating mats. As it's exposed to air and sunlight, the algae decay and produces a rotten egg smell.

""Anytime there’s anything in the water with potential danger, you have to be very careful. Respiratory and otherwise,"" said Nelson.

As the warning signs continue to present themselves, the DEP said it will continue testing and warn people to stay away from the bloom.

""I'm worried about the well-being of the wildlife and what’s going on and what consequences that will have,"" said Annabelle Von Girsewald.

To respond as quickly and efficiently as possible, residents and visitors are encouraged to report algal blooms through the DEP's hotline at 1-855-305-3903 or through the online reporting system at https://floridadep.gov/dear/algal-bloom.

The blue Chevy pickup truck drove west on Oil Well Road, police say, blew through a stop sign and hung a left onto Tamiami Trail in the dark of night, around 3:15 a.m., Monday. Florida sheriff’s deputies turned on their lights and sirens. When they approached the pickup, the driver said he and his passenger had been collecting frogs and snakes from under a nearby overpass.

The driver, Michael Cody Clemons, told officers that he and his passenger, Ariel Michelle Marchan-Le Quire, were gathering the wildlife together, according to an incident report.

There are some animals that people are simply not allowed to possess in Florida, or at the very least, that people can’t have unless they have a permit. Bears, tigers, rhinoceroses and crocodiles are illegal. Cougars, howler monkeys, wolves and cassowaries are fine as long as a permit is obtained. Particularly applicable in this instance: Florida law does not allow the capture or possession of poisonous reptiles — copperheads, eastern diamondbacks, coral snakes to name a few — unless there’s a permit involved.

[9 dead gray whales have washed up in the Bay Area. A scientist says that’s ‘very unusual.’]

So the Charlotte County deputy asked Clemons and Marchan-Le Quire if they would open their backpacks and show their haul — just to make sure they didn’t have anything illegal, the report says.

Clemons, 22, had clothes and other personal items in his bag.

Marchan-Le Quire, 25, grabbed her backpack from the floor next to her feet and unzipped it to show 43 small turtles piled inside, the report says.

“Anything else?” a second deputy asked.

It was then that Marchan-Le Quire reached into her yoga pants and tugged out a foot-long alligator.

According to the incident report, the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission seized the animals and released them back into the wild. Clemons and Marchan-Le Quire were cited for violations of state wildlife laws.

The sheriff’s office joked about the incident on Twitter: “Not to be outdone by # Floridaman, a # FloridaWoman pulled this alligator out of her pants this morning during traffic stop after being asked the standard ‘Do you have anything else?’”

Teen to be charged as adult in Flagler County murder,"- A 17-year-old will be charged as an adult for the murder of another teenager in Flagler County.

Marion Gavins Jr., of Palm Coast, has been indicted by a grand jury for first-degree murder and will be tried as an adult.

Flagler County deputies arrested Gavins in April for the murder of 18-year-old Curtis Israel Gray.

According to investigators, Gavins and Gray got into an altercation outside the Coin Laundry on Belle Terre near Palm Coast Parkway and at some point, deputies say he shot and killed Gray.

Witnesses at the scene were able to help authorities quickly identify a suspect.

“Our detectives worked swiftly and strategically to solve this murder investigation and were able to take Gavins Jr. into custody without anyone else getting hurt,” Sheriff Rick Staly said. ""This is a tragedy for two families, one who lost a son who was an aspiring athlete and the other whose son will likely spend the rest of his life in prison or face the death penalty. I hope this fast arrest will help the Gray family with their loss.""

Gavins is being held by the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office at the Duval County Jail in Jacksonville until he turns 18 years old on May16. Once Gavins turns 18, he will be transported back to the Sheriff Perry Hall Inmate Detention Facility in Flagler County, according to a press release.

“We fully support the state’s decision and applaud the Grand Jury and State Attorney Larizza,” Sheriff Staly said. “Sadly, this is a young man who exhibited increasingly violent behavior that ultimately caused another teenager’s death. Being tried as an adult is the most appropriate way to prosecute this crime.""

Gavins reportedly has a criminal arrest history dating back to 2014 that includes sale of marijuana, violation of probation, possession of a weapon on school campus, and domestic violence.

"Grand Rapids man flagged by FBI, arrested","Grand Rapids man flagged by FBI, arrested Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Video

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — A Grand Rapids man who was flagged by the FBI after allegedly building bombs is now facing a federal charge of lying to an officer.

Aaron Fein, 24, first showed up on the radar of federal authorities when he was stopped at the U.S- Canada border with a notebook containing a handwritten checklist of ingredients to build a bomb that could be remotely detonated, a federal criminal complaint shows.

Investigators say Fein told them the notebook contained “things on the internet that interested him.”

The complaint says Fein alerted federal authorities to “partially-constructed electronic triggering devices” in his bedroom he said he built.

Fein, who was trying to re-enter the U.S., told investigators he was ""going crazy"" because a power outage knocked out his internet serve, and he wanted to go to Canada before he died.

SYMPATHIZING WITH SHOOTERS

When authorities examined Fein's laptop and desktop computers, they found he’d been searching about mass murders, terrorism and mass shootings, the complaint states. A search of his phone found he’d searched how to enter Canada illegally and about the Florida mass shooting at a video game tournament days before he was detained.

Fein, an industrial engineering graduate who described himself as friendless, “stated that although he felt sympathy for victims of such events, he also felt empathy for people who committed such acts because they must have their reasons and that he felt isolated and maligned by society,” the court document states.

In an Aug. 30 interview, Fein told federal investigators he thought the people behind mass casualty incidents “had been bullied in school and that, like him, they had probably been on medications at some point in their lives, according to the complaint.

Federal authorities say Fein also admitted to posting pictures of mass shooters, saying he was unemployed and that maybe he should “go shoot up a school.”

FLAGGED BY THE FBI

The criminal complaint also outlined Fein’s mental health struggles and repeated attempts to buy a gun, which started on Oct. 3 and involved three Grand Rapids area stores. Each time, a national criminal background check came back with red flags based on the FBI investigation and the sale was delayed.

When asked why he wanted a weapon, Fein told authorities in subsequent interviews that he “did not want to feel inferior to people that did own firearms” and for self-defense.

Even after promising an agent he would visit a psychologist and not purchase a gun, Fein revisited all three gun stores and finally succeeded in buying a gun, the complaint says. Fein agreed to give up the gun to the agent, but returned to the shooting range that day to fire a rental gun until a store employee recognized him and called Wyoming police.

The document states two days later, Fein visited the third gun store in Cascade Township to try to rent a gun to use on their range. Some employees there were aware of the trespassing complaint against Fein at the other gun store and thought he was “behaving strangely” so they refused to rent to him or allow him to use the range.

“Fein became angry and left the premises shouting,” the complaint states.

Authorities ordered Fein be picked up for a hospital evaluation on March 7. A psychologist determined he was “struggling with depression, hopelessness, and thoughts of hurting others” and needed in-patient treatment.

'SUBSTANTIAL RISK' ON THE MOVE

On March 20, Fein was released on the conditions that he still seek out-patient treatment, take his medication and not own a gun. At a probate court hearing that day, the court determined Fein posed a “substantial risk” of harm to himself or others “in the near future.”

About a month later on the day a Florida woman obsessed with the Columbine High School shooting took her own life, Fein visited an Ann Arbor gun range, the complaint says. Federal agents say he rented an AR-15 rifle and purchased 100 rounds of ammunition and a lesson on how to use the weapon.

During the lesson, the FBI contacted the store. Employees lied about problems with range’s ventilation system to halt his lesson with a promise of continuing it later. The federal court document says Fein then traveled to Cabela’s in Dundee where he asked about ammunition compatible with an AR-15, then drove to Ohio where he spent the night near another gun store.

At that point, federal authorities ordered police to pick up Fein. Michigan State Police stopped him on his way back to Cabela’s During police questioning, Fein admitted to visiting a gun store on the east side of the state “to ask questions,” but denied handling or firing a weapon, the complaint states.

On Monday, Fein's aunt told 24 Hour News 8 over the phone that the family is fighting the charge and doesn't believe he's a threat to the public.",http://www.woodtv.com/news/grand-rapids/grand-rapids-man-flagged-by-fbi-arrested/1983558595,2019-05-06T23:13:02Z,WOODTV,"120 College Ave SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49503, USA"

Keith Urban takes a wild Uber ride to get to Florida music festival,"Apparently neither rain, nor lightning, nor the horrors of Interstate 95 could stop Keith Urban from performing at SunFest on Sunday.

The country music star from Australia was scheduled to perform on the Ford stage Sunday night around 7:30 p.m., but because of heavy rains, winds and lightning, his flight couldn’t land at Palm Beach International Airport. That flight was at first diverted to the Boca Raton airport, he explained to the crowd, but, when they couldn’t land in Boca, they eventually flew into Miami.

After a delay departing the plane because of lightning strikes, they grabbed an Uber and high-tailed it north. Urban and his band hit the stage just after 9 p.m. and played until about 10:30 p.m.

Urban told the crowd the Uber driver was going “like 150 miles an hour.” He said he didn’t speak English,” and just said “music?” which Urban said, “yes, turn it up.”

Urban told the crowd the driver at one point flashed his lights at a car in front of them because the driver was only doing 90.

Urban said he even downloaded an app so he could check the driver’s speed.

Urban tweeted during the ride north, with photos of the torrential downpour. ”...we are in an Uber and driving like the dude stole it ! (man I hope he didn’t ...) we may be a little late ... but WE WILL FREAKIN BE THERE - KU”

Urban even tweeted a photo of one of those signs on I-95 that deliver messages to drivers. “HEAD LIGHTS ON WHEN ITS RAINING ... YOU THINK????? - KU” he tweeted.

After the show, Urban sent two tweets thanking his fans and the Uber driver.

In a video posted to Twitter, Urban said they had just come offstage and mentioned SunFest and the “insane weather” and being rerouted to Miami. Urban, named the 2018 Country Music Awards’ Entertainer of the Year, apologized to his fans who had waited. “You guys were amazing, incredibly patient ... and completely gave us all the love in the world when we got here so thank you every much. ...”

The 2019 Florida Historical Society Annual Meeting and Symposium is being held May 16-18 at the Radisson Resort at the Port in Cape Canaveral. The theme of the conference is “Countdown to History: Ice Age to the Space Age.”

Dozens of presenters from throughout the state and beyond will discuss a wide variety of topics related to Florida history and culture.

Glen Doran is a local hero to archaeology enthusiasts. In the mid-1980s, Doran was principal archaeologist for the Windover Dig, a world famous excavation that uncovered an ancient pond cemetery in north Brevard County.

Nearly 200 remarkably well preserved human burials were uncovered, that were between 7,000 and 8,000 years old. The bodies were wrapped in the oldest woven cloth found in North America, and 91 of the skulls contained intact brain matter.

Doran will open the FHS conference with the presentation “Windover and Beyond: 35 Years of Archaeology on the Space Coast.”

“I’m looking forward to being back in the area,” Doran said. “I’m sure that some of the people that worked on the Windover crew will be coming to the talk. One of the things that made this work particularly satisfying was the level of community involvement.”

Conference attendees will take a tour of the Brevard Museum of History and Natural Science in Cocoa, where artifacts from the Windover Dig are displayed.

They will also visit the Harry T. and Harriette V. Moore Cultural Complex in Mims, which includes a civil rights museum, a reflecting pool, and a replica of the Moore family home.

On Christmas night, 1951, a bomb exploded under the Moore’s home. The couple died from injuries sustained in the blast, making them the first martyrs of the contemporary civil rights movement. Harry T. Moore traveled throughout the state registering African Americans to vote.

“Harry Moore, of course, being an educated person, knew that power lay in the ballot box,” said Bill Gary, president of the Moore Cultural Complex. “If you cannot elect a person like yourself, then you try to use your voting power to vote for those persons who, at least, express some interest in your concerns.”

Gary’s work at the Moore Cultural Complex has earned him the Florida Historical Society’s Lifetime Achievement Award, which will be presented at the conference banquet dinner.

The 50th anniversary of the first manned mission to the moon is another focal point of the upcoming Florida Historical Society Annual Meeting and Symposium. Historian Lori Walters has spent decades documenting the impact of the space program on Brevard County. She will be moderating “A Conversation with Apollo-Era Space Workers” including Al Koller, Bill Heink, John Tribe, and Bill Waldren.

“Project Mercury is designed to get an American into space,” Walters said. “Then Project Gemini is there to provide all the links that we need to prove that a human being can survive fourteen days in a tin can orbiting the earth, we can rendezvous, we can do a spacewalk, and all these things that we have to prove to ultimately land a man on the moon. Running alongside that is Apollo.”

Much of the technology needed to complete a lunar mission did not exist when President John F. Kennedy declared in May 1961, that America would land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth before the end of the decade.

“Saturn 5 doesn’t exist yet,” Walters said. “The very craft that you need, the Apollo craft itself, and the booster, they don’t even exist yet.”

Local space workers would rise to the challenge, of course, and Kennedy’s vision was realized in July 1969, with five months to spare.

The FHS conference will include a tour of the Kennedy Space Center.

Former astronaut Winston Scott will help to commemorate the Apollo 11 moon landing with his keynote presentation “From the Cape into Space: The Adventures of a NASA Astronaut.”

“I remember sitting in front of my television watching those old grainy pictures, when Neil Armstrong first stepped on the moon,” Scott recalled. “I was a freshman in college, and I can remember how exciting that was.”

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WFLA) - Authorities say a man became upset when he lost a video game and allegedly punched his 1-month-old son in the head.

Anthony Trice, 26, of Louisville, Kentucky was arrested and charged with first-degree criminal abuse, WAVE reported.

According to an arrest report, Trice was home alone with the child, playing a video game when the incident occurred. When he started losing the game, he became frustrated and threw the controller and punched the boy in the head.

She was pregnant when NASA offered to send her to space. Anna Fisher didn’t hesitate.,"

The moment Anna Lee Fisher had been waiting for came on a hot summer afternoon in 1983. Five years had passed since Fisher and five other women were chosen to become America’s first female astronauts. But she hadn’t yet been to space.

Her boss asked to see her in his office. He requested that her husband, who was also in the astronaut training program, come along too. They sat down at his desk together.

“I’m thinking,” her boss said, “of sending Anna.”

This was what Fisher, then 33 years old, had wanted. There was only one little thing to consider — and it was currently growing inside her. On the day she was asked to climb into a shuttle and be blasted into the solar system, Fisher was eight and a half months pregnant.

She still didn’t hesitate.

“I wasn’t about to say no,” she said last month in an interview with The Washington Post. “You don’t say no to that offer.”

And that was how Anna Fisher became the world’s first mother to go to space. A few weeks after being chosen for a flight, Fisher gave birth to a daughter, Kristin.

She will soon mark the 35th anniversary of her flight, the day she became an inspirational figure to working moms everywhere — including to her daughter. Kristin is now a D.C.-based correspondent for Fox News and the mother of a 16-month old girl.

“I always grew up thinking I could have a demanding full-time job and be a mom,” Kristin said. “The example that she set for me, it was never a question. It wasn’t until I got pregnant and started thinking about the logistics that I started thinking, ‘How did she do this?’”

The answer is something Anna Fisher had to figure out fast. She gave birth to Kristin on a Friday. By Monday, she was back at NASA, carrying the doughnut-shaped pillow that would make it possible to sit down for the team meeting.

She wanted to send a message to her male co-workers and bosses: She might have had a baby, but she was still on the job.

“It was worth it just to see the looks on their faces,” she recalled.

Fisher had always planned to have a family, and even told the selection committee for the astronaut training program of that plan during her interview. She and her husband, Bill, were emergency room doctors in California in 1977 when they applied to NASA’s open call for potential astronauts. Bill wouldn’t get in for another two years. But Fisher, at 28 years old, made the cut and moved to Houston.

There were six women in the class of 35 new astronauts — all of whom were determined to ensure their male colleagues treated them as equally qualified. Sally Ride, who would become the first American woman in space, went shopping with Fisher for baggy khaki pants so they would be wearing outfits similar to NASA’s men. Fisher never wore makeup at work. She attended the astronauts’ spouses’ club, so that her colleagues’ wives wouldn’t feel uneasy about a woman working so closely with them.

For 14 months before her flight, Fisher juggled her training and NASA obligations with caring for her new daughter. She and Bill asked her mom for help and hired a nanny. She started pointing out to reporters that the men on her flight were leaving their children behind, too.

At work, she learned how to serve as “Capcom,” the person in mission control who communicates with the astronauts already in orbit. It was an important role, requiring long, intense shifts — one her commander suggested she might want to give up. “You’ve got Kristin, you’re training, it’s too much,” he said.

Fisher begged him to reconsider, and won. Only when mission control lost the connection with the flight in orbit did Fisher run into the bathroom and pump her breast milk.

“They never had pumping rooms or anything like that,” Fisher remembered. “ It never even occurred to me to ask for one. It never occurred to any of us to ask for special accommodations for anything.”

Soon she was assigned the job of designing the crew patch that would represent her team’s flight, STS-51-A. She put six stars on it: one for each astronaut aboard, and one for baby Kristin.

[‘Houston, we have a problem’: The amazing history of the iconic Apollo 13 misquote]

In the weeks before her launch in November 1984, she recorded dozens of videos of herself with Kristin. In the days before, she wrote her daughter a letter:

“If anything happens to me, just know that I love you so much,” it said. “Your dad and your grandma will take care of you. And I’ll be watching over you.”

Her flight was only NASA’s second trip using the space shuttle Discovery. She understood the risk she was taking.

On the day she walked out to the launchpad in Florida, her husband used his NASA access to make sure that he, Kristin and Fisher’s mom could be there to wave goodbye. Then Fisher climbed aboard Discovery and shot into the sky.

Her flight was a seven-day, 23-hour mission, focused on retrieving and dispatching satellites. Unlike today’s astronauts, who can call and videoconference their children, Fisher had no way of communicating with her family while on board. Instead, she would sit at the window of the spacecraft, looking down at Earth while playing a tape she’d brought in her Walkman. It was a recording of Kristin saying, “I luh, I luh.” I love you.

After traveling 3.3 million miles, Fisher returned safely home. She slipped the letter she had written to Kristin in her jewelry box, grateful her daughter would never have to read it — but prepared to write another the next time she went to space.

Within a month, she was assigned to another flight. Six weeks before it was set to occur, the Challenger space shuttle exploded. One of the six people who lost their lives that day was Fisher’s friend Judy Resnik, who’d joined the astronaut program alongside her.

After the Challenger, the shuttle program ground to a halt, and Fisher took a seven-year leave of absence to raise Kristin and have her second child, Kara.

She returned to NASA in 1996 and went on to become chief of the space station branch and one of the longest-serving astronauts in the agency’s history.

Today, 50 American women have been to space, plenty of them moms. Many told Fisher that when they were kids, they wrote to her, and she mailed them a photo and an autograph.

She loved hearing them chatting to each other in NASA’s halls, switching effortlessly from talk of spacewalks and mission controls to pediatricians and play dates.

In 2017, Fisher retired from NASA at age 67. The same year, she became a grandmother, and soon found herself helping her daughter navigate the same worries she had when she was a new mom. Kristin’s job as a Fox News correspondent means she is often asked to go on reporting trips around the country and the world.

“She calls me and asks about traveling,” Fisher said. “I say, ‘Do you remember when I was gone when you were that age?' ”

Kristin doesn’t. She said her mom always asks, “Are you glad that I did it? That I took the time away from you, took that risk and went into space?' ”

“And the answer,” Kristin said. “is unequivocally, ‘Yes.’ ”

“I told Kristin to not feel guilty for being away,” Fisher said. “If you’re doing something you love, or you’re bringing the money in, you’re doing something important for your child.”

And when she can, Grandma, or “Nana Anna” as Clara calls her, comes to babysit while Kristin works. In April, Fisher came to Washington to watch Clara on the evening Kristin and her husband attended the White House correspondents’ dinner.

They spent the weekend reading some of the books Fisher bought for her granddaughter: “Organic Chemistry for Babies” and “Astrophysics for Babies.” Then they went outside for their favorite activity. Fisher plopped Clara into a baby-size swing. She lifted her backward and began to count.

“Five, four, three, two, one,” she said. “Blastoff.”

Then she let go and watched her granddaughter swing toward the sky.

How golf explains Trump. Seriously. ,"Have you ever won a tournament you never competed in? Have you ever stolen the ball from a child to gain a competitive advantage?

If the answer to either or both of those questions is no, then you’re not cheating at the highest level. Which is to say, you’re not cheating like President Donald Trump.

In a new book, Commander in Cheat, sportswriter Rick Reilly explores Trump’s complicated relationship with the game of golf, and shows the near-heroic efforts he makes to lie about his scores, sabotage his opponents, and generally defraud the sport.

Golf match? I've won 18 Club Championships including this weekend. @mcuban swings like a little girl with no power or talent. Mark's a loser — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 19, 2013

Trump’s cheating at golf might seem trivial compared to his political shenanigans, but there’s another way to think about it: Golf is a game built on self-governance, Reilly says, and in that way, it’s like a “Rorschach test for your morality.” And some of the stories about Trump are truly absurd. “In a weird way,” Reilly told me, they “say as much about Trump as almost anything else we know about him, because it cuts to the core of his character.”

A lightly edited transcript of my conversation with Reilly follows.

Sean Illing

Trump claims to have won at least 20 club championships at his golf courses. What is a club championship? And how many of those has he actually won?

Rick Reilly

Once a year, every country club has a club championship for the best players. It lasts two or three days, and it’s a big thing if you win it. The best player I know of at this level won eight of these club championships — that’s the most I’ve ever heard of.

Trump’s going around telling people he has won 20. But that’s 100 percent a lie. I actually played with him once, and he told me how he does it: Whenever he opens a new golf course, because he owns 14 and operates another five, he plays the first club champion by himself and declares that the club championship and puts his name on the wall.

But it’s usually just him and Melania in the cart and nobody else. He just makes it up.

Sean Illing

Give me the most outrageous cheating story in the book.

Rick Reilly

Here’s one: While Trump was meeting with Kim [Jong Un] in Singapore, a club championship was held at Trump International, a course Trump built near Mar-a-Lago in Florida for his rich people friends to join. So anyway, a month later, Trump’s there at his golf course, with the Secret Service and the SWAT team guys and all that stuff. And he sees Ted Virtue, one of the financiers behind the movie Green Book.

Virtue — who wouldn’t speak to me directly, but the story was reported by Golf.com and I confirmed it through two other members of the club — was playing with his kid, who I think is 10 or 11 years old. He [Trump] sees Ted on the 12th hole and decides to drive his cart over there. He tells Ted: Congrats on winning the club championship, but you didn’t really win it because I was out of town.

Ted tries to laugh it off, but Trump is dead serious. Trump says, “We’re going to play these last six holes for the championship.” And Ted’s like, “I’m playing with my son, but thanks anyway.” But Trump says, “No, your son can play too.” So they end up playing.

They get to a hole with a big pond on it. Both Ted and his son hit the ball on the green, and Trump hits his in the water. By the time they get to the hole, Trump is lining up the kid’s ball. Only now it’s his ball and the caddie has switched it. The kid’s like, “Daddy, that’s my ball.”

But Trump’s caddie goes, “No, this is the president’s ball; your ball went in the water.” Ted and his son look at each other confused, not sure if this is really happening. And Trump’s caddie says, “This is the president’s ball. I don’t know what to tell you.”

Trump makes that putt, wins one up, and declares himself the club champion.

Sean Illing

Were you able to talk to Trump at any point while you were working on this and ask him about this stuff?

Rick Reilly

Nope. I tried to interview him. I sent him a FedEx letter. I called the people I know in the White House Press Office. I texted. I don’t know what else I could have done to try to get an interview. But he wouldn’t talk to me. Eric Trump, who’s in charge of the golf[-related business], wouldn’t talk to me. Don Jr. wouldn’t talk to me.

I talked to a ton of people while reporting this book — Republicans, Democrats, random people in Trump’s orbit. They all have a story. But half of them wouldn’t let me use it. Some of them like his policies, some don’t want to be [targeted by Trump]. Even when I said, “Just let me use the story and I won’t put your name on it,” they still said no.

Sean Illing

What’s interesting to me is what Trump’s cheating says about the unreality he lives in.

Rick Reilly

I mean, he’s always been like this. We’ve known this guy in the sports world for 30 years. He’s always told people that no one can beat him, that he’s the best of the rich guys. But it’s always been complete bullshit, and everyone knows it.

For example, he’s played in the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, a really popular golf tournament that’s full of rich guys, for seven straight years. His team has never made the cut — not once. He constantly says he can beat anybody among the rich, but I’ve played in the Tahoe Celebrity tournament with him several times and he’s never finished in the top half.

I realize how silly all of this is, but it’s also serious because of what it says about the man, about who and what he actually is. I always say golf is like bicycle shorts — it reveals a lot about a man. And the fact that he has to prop up his bullshit reputation as this fantastic golfer is pretty revealing.

Sean Illing

What’s the point of all this cheating? He’s not competing for money or a pro contract, right? What purpose does any of this serve?

Rick Reilly

He always wins, even if he loses — that’s it. He just wants to tell people he beat your ass. I asked a psychiatrist and he said that someone with this kind of narcissism, which is really a personality disorder, they just can’t stand the idea that they’re not number one, that they’re not the best. So they have to make shit up.

Someone once asked him to rate the best 10 courses in America. He put five of his courses in the top 10. But when you go to the Golf Digest Top 200, his best course is ranked 156.

“This guy cheats like a mafia accountant”

Sean Illing

Do you think he’s convinced himself that he’s not cheating?

Rick Reilly

Oh, for sure. I’ve had three or four people tell me they called him on it on the first hole. He kicks the ball so much that caddies call him Pelé [a reference to the famous Brazilian soccer player]. He throws it out of bunkers, he retakes shots, he throws other people’s balls into the water.

But every time people call him on it, he has the same answer, which is, “Oh, the guys I play with, you’ve got to do this just to keep it fair.” It’s the Lance Armstrong defense: Everybody’s doing it, so I have to do it just to keep up, otherwise I’m getting cheated. It’s the default rationalization of a cheater.

But in reality, the National Golf Foundation says 90 percent of people don’t cheat when they play. But this guy cheats like a mafia accountant.

Sean Illing

Why should anyone care that Trump cheats at golf?

Rick Reilly

I can only speak for myself. I grew up in the game. My dad taught me the game. He taught me that we don’t cheat each other, you don’t cheat your friends, because the space of golf is so huge, it’s the very easiest game to cheat at. So it’s absolutely a Rorschach test for your morality. You could say it doesn’t matter, and I certainly understand that reaction. But in a weird way, it says as much about Trump as almost anything else we know about him, because it cuts to the core of his character.

Sean Illing

What happened with his big golf venture in Puerto Rico?

Rick Reilly

Before he was president, he went down to Puerto Rico and took a contract to help a course there called Cocoa Beach outside San Juan. He convinced these people that he was going to come down and bring all his celebrity friends and he was going to get a lot of press for them, and he was going to get their business rolling again.

Well, it didn’t roll. In fact, they lost money. And they said, “Okay, we’re quitting. We’re going to call it bankruptcy.” Trump said, “No, you need to take out a loan from the government,” so they took out a $32 million loan. And then, again, they lost money. Trump pulled up stakes and left, and the government was stuck with a $32 million unpaid loan.

Fast-forward to the time of his presidency, when Puerto Rico is devastated by a natural disaster, he turns his back on them again. I’m not saying these two things are linked. I’m just saying twice he’s turned his back on the same group of American citizens.

Sean Illing

I’m curious why you decided to write this book. You don’t really wade into politics that much, so why put this out into the world?

Rick Reilly

Because of my dad, who passed away. My dad taught me that golf was a gentleman’s game, that you never cheat a guy. To see a guy cheating and telling people he won tournaments he didn’t even play in, and telling people he won tournaments that weren’t even held — it just bothers me. He’s leaving a big orange splotch all over my game, and that’s why I wrote the book.",https://www.vox.com/2019/5/10/18524172/donald-trump-commander-in-cheat-rick-reilly,2019-05-10T08:10:00Z,Vox,"1201 Connecticut Avenue NW 11th Floor Washington, DC 20036"
Jaguars sound as confused as everyone else about why Telvin Smith is walking away,"

Jacksonville Jaguars linebacker Telvin Smith announced Thursday that he needed to “take time away from the game” to get his “world in order.” He didn’t offer a specific reason for his apparent hiatus, leaving it a mystery to Jaguars fans — and, apparently, to the team itself.

In a statement released shortly after the five-year veteran reportedly made his announcement on his private Instagram account, the Jaguars said, “We will not have a comment about Telvin Smith’s statement at this time. We need to have a conversation with Telvin to understand the situation and the circumstances.

“If there is a way we can support him we need to understand that.”

From Jaguars Telvin Smith’s Instagram account. I’m told it is in fact his account. It states he will not play football this season. pic.twitter.com/JXaroE0tOF — James Palmer (@JamesPalmerTV) May 9, 2019

Assuming Smith doesn’t play this season, he’ll be walking away from $9.75 million in base salary, part of a four-year, $45 million contract extension he signed during the 2017 season when he made the Pro Bowl. If he winds up never playing football again, Jacksonville could seek to recoup several million dollars in signing-bonus money, per reports.

Smith indicated that he might be back by 2020, writing in his announcement, “I just ask y’all respect my decision to not play football this season.”

The 28-year-old began his message by saying, “It was said to me from a great coach that in order for the man to be his best, he must get his world in order. At this time, I must take time away from the game and get my world in order. I must give this time back to myself, my family and my health.""

One of only 13 players in NFL history to record 100+ tackles in each of their first 5 seasons.



Also the only player with at least:



-100 tackles

-2 INTs

-1 fumble recovery



in EACH of the last 3 seasons.



Only 15 other players have done that in even ONE of the last three seasons https://t.co/JCVu4dXbAS — Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) May 9, 2019

Smith added, “I know the rumors of trade talk came about, but I started my career in Jacksonville and the day I do decide to call it quits it will be right here [in Jacksonville].” He was referring to rumors that surfaced before April’s draft that Smith might be dealt for picks.

Speculation about the linebacker’s future with the team was hardly doused after Jacksonville General Manager Dave Caldwell was asked during the draft if Smith would be on the roster in 2019. “We’ll see,” Caldwell said. “I don’t want to get into hypotheticals.”

The GM’s comments came just after he spent a third-round pick on a relatively unheralded linebacker prospect, Murray State’s Quincy Williams. In March, the Jaguars signed former Green Bay Packers linebacker Jake Ryan, a move that was followed by Smith declining to show up for voluntary team workouts.

A week after those training sessions began, and several days before the draft kicked off, Jaguars Coach Doug Marrone told reporters that Smith still hadn’t responded to his calls and text messages. “He’s probably busy,” Marrone said at the time.

To judge from Thursday’s statement, the Jaguars still have not heard directly from Smith, who was named a team captain last season. Smith finally broke his silence on Monday, in a way, with comments on Instagram Live in which he said, “This week, y’all gonna know what’s going on. It’s been out there, it just ain’t been out there. I’ve been saying what’s up.”

“Understand this, I never left Duval. I’m never leaving Duval,” Smith continued, referring to Jacksonville’s county, the name of which is frequently used as a rallying cry by the Jaguars and their fans. “It’s Duval till we die, you understand me? Y’all seen trade rumors and stuff — y’all seen me go anywhere? Exactly. Y’all seen the rumors go somewhere, but y’all ain’t seen me go nowhere, because I ain’t going nowhere.”

A native of Georgia, Smith played in college at Florida State. As a senior he was the leading tackler for a Seminoles unit that led the nation in scoring defense and interceptions. After testing positive for marijuana at the 2014 NFL scouting combine, he fell to the fifth round of the draft, at which point he more than lived up to the Jaguars’ hopes that they had gotten a steal.

Smith has at least 100 tackles in each of his five NFL seasons, culminating in a career-high 134 in 2018, and his 586 total tackles in that span are the fifth most in the NFL (per Pro Football Reference). Relatively light for his position at 215 pounds, the 6-foot-3 Smith brings valuable speed to combat pass-heavy offenses. He has nine career interceptions, three of which he returned for touchdowns.

"Sex offender arrested after allegedly saying he would 'rape the first woman he sees,' Arkansas sheriff says","A convicted child rapist prompted Arkansas officials Monday to issue a public warning and rearrest him soon after his release from a hospital where he threatened to ""rape the first woman he sees"" once he got out, authorities said.

The Hempstead County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post that John Mark West, 38, was arrested for making terroristic threats and disorderly conduct only hours after his hospital release.

West, a level 3 sex offender, was originally arrested by police in Hope on April 26 for disorderly conduct before being transported to a mental hospital for evaluation. West, who was convicted in 1996 and served jail time for the rape of a 4-year-old girl, told officials he was homeless and lived in Hope, Arkansas.

The sheriff’s department said that hospital officials informed them that West would be released back to Hempstead County on Monday.

""West apparently suffers from mental illness and is stable while on medication,"" police said in a warning to the public. ""He is telling the hospital personnel that he will not stay on his medication when he walks out of the hospital.""

West told the hospital staff he would ""rape the first woman he sees"" so he could come back to the Arkansas Department of Corrections, Hempstead County Sheriff James Singleton said.

""West reported that he has previously had command hallucinations that told him to rape a woman,"" according to Singleton.

Hours after the sheriff's office put a warning out to the public to contact 911 if West was seen, officials announced he had been arrested by Hempstead County deputies.

""He has a history of several criminal charges,"" Singleton said to the newspaper. ""A level-3 sexual offender is one level below being the worse level of sexual offender.

The University of Vermont men's basketball team has filled a big need for its frontcourt.

Literally.

Alabama's Daniel Giddens, a 6-foot-11, 247-pound forward, is transferring to the Catamounts. Giddens, a graduate transfer, has one year remaining and is eligible to play for UVM in the upcoming 2019-20 season.

Giddens confirmed the move to Vermont in a text message to a Burlington Free Press reporter on Wednesday morning.

With the departures of forwards Samuel Dingba (graduation) and Ra Kpedi (transfer), Giddens is a welcomed addition on the Catamounts' guard-heavy roster.

Giddens, a Georgia native, is an athletic big man who can defend and more than likely complement the game of America East player of the year Anthony Lamb. Lamb, a senior to be, declared for the NBA draft last month but has until May 29 to withdraw his name to retain his eligibility.

A former top-60 player and four-star recruit out of Oak Hill Academy in 2015, Giddens spent his freshman year at Ohio State, where he started seven out of 33 games, averaging 3.8 points, 3.6 rebounds and 1.5 blocks a game.

After transferring to Alabama and sitting out the 2016-17 season, Giddens worked his way into the starting lineup in 18 of 34 games as a sophomore, averaging 4.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 0.9 blocks a game.

Giddens missed the final four games of this past season with a hand injury and only saw action in 14 games total. Alabama went 18-16, lost to Kentucky in the SEC tournament and then fell in the first round of the NIT.

UVM has one remaining scholarship open for 2019-20. Eric Beckett (Tilton School, New Hampshire) and Aaron Deloney (Grant H.S. in Portland, Oregon) are signed incoming freshmen who will join Giddens as UVM's new faces when the team reconvenes for summer workouts in June.

The Catamounts are coming off the program's seventh America East tournament crown. UVM went 27-7 overall and lost to Florida State in the opening round of the NCAA tournament.

Trump not the first president whose politics made athletes reconsider White House visit,"CLOSE What I'm Hearing: From outside the White House, Golfweek's Adam Woodard details the emotions that went through Tiger Woods as he received his Medal of Freedom from President Trump. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has had some well-publicized spats with sports stars since taking office, and members of several championship teams (in some cases, the whole team) have not made the traditional White House visit because of political differences with the president.

This week, Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora announced he won't join his World Series championship team when they attend their White House ceremony on Thursday. Cora – who last year called Trump's tweets about Hurricane Maria's death toll ""disrespectful"" – said he doesn't ""feel comfortable celebrating in the White House"" while people in Puerto Rico are ""still struggling"" with the hurricane's aftermath.

But Trump's White House is not the first where politics have driven players to skip the meeting with the president (although it is the first to rescind invitations for entire teams).

White House visits by sports teams date back to 1865, according to ESPN, but invitations to championship teams didn't become a regular occurrence until former President Ronald Reagan's administration. In the decades since, several players have declined invites from different presidents for a range of political reasons. Here is a look at some of the political controversies and notable no-shows from White House visits over the years.

Ryder Cup Team 1993

Several golfers from America's 1993 Ryder Cup team expressed reservations about meeting with President Bill Clinton ahead of what would be a victorious journey to England.

One team member, John Cook, said, ""It would be an honor to meet the president, but it would be hypocritical ... We are examples of people who work hard and make a lot of money, and he wants to take it away and give it to people who don't give a damn.""

Payne Stewart told the Orlando Sentinel that his friend Paul Azinger, who was also on the team, didn't ""want to shake hands with a draft dodger,"" referring to Clinton's lack of military service during the Vietnam War. Azinger initially denied the quote, but later told author John Feinstein, ""I guess I should have told Payne that we were talking off the record.""

Captain Tom Watson was eventually able to persuade the reluctant team to go and Azinger told The Washington Post the White House visit ""was just wonderful.""

Bruins goalie Tim Thomas 2012

The Boston Bruins goalie and tea party supporter did not accompany his team to the White House in January 2012 to celebrate their Stanley Cup win because the federal government had ""grown out of control, threatening the Rights, Liberties, and Property of the People,"" the Post reported.

""Because I believe this, today I exercised my right as a Free Citizen, and did not visit the White House. This was not about politics or party, as in my opinion both parties are responsible for the situation we are in as a country. This was about a choice I had to make as an INDIVIDUAL,"" he said, according to the Post.

Former President Barack Obama was in office at the time.

Ravens center Matt Birk 2013

Center Matt Birk skipped the Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens' trip to the White House in June 2013 because the devout Catholic objected to Obama's support for Planned Parenthood.

""I wasn't there,"" Birk said, according to The Baltimore Sun. ""I would say that I have great respect for the office of the Presidency, but about five or six weeks ago, our President made a comment in a speech and he said, 'God bless Planned Parenthood.'""

In a speech at a Planned Parenthood event in April that year, Obama closed by saying, ""Thank you Planned Parenthood. God bless you/ God bless America,""

Birk retired after that season.

3 members of '72 Dolphins

A couple of months after Birk's snub, three members of the undefeated 1972 Dolphins declined to attend a White House celebration for the Super Bowl champs, who won before such visits had become a tradition.

Bob Kuechenberg told the South Florida Sun Sentinel, ""I want to be careful, because mom said if you have nothing good to say about someone, then don't say anything. I don't have anything good to say about someone.""

""We've got some real moral compass issues in Washington,"" Jim Langer said, according to the Sun Sentinel. ""I don't want to be in a room with those people and pretend I'm having a good time. I can't do that.""

""I'll just say my views are diametrically opposed to the President's,"" Manny Fernandez told the Florida paper.

The Golden State Warriors 2017

In September 2017, Trump rescinded his invitation to the NBA Champion Golden State Warriors because star player Stephen Curry was ""hesitating.""

Prior to Trump telling them they weren't invited, Curry had said he thought the team should skip the event to show Trump that ""we don't stand for"" the ""things that he's said and the things that he hasn't said at the right times."" Coach Steve Kerr and Finals MVP Kevin Durant expressed similar sentiments.

A month before, Trump had been heavily criticized for saying there were ""very fine people on both sides"" of a confrontation between white nationalists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, that resulted in a woman's death.

2018 USA Olympians

Some of the biggest names from the 2018 Winter Olympics were not present to pose for photos with the president at the White House in April 2018.

Several of those who did not attend – including Lindsey Vonn, Adam Rippon, and Gus Kenworthy – made it explicitly clear that they did not wish to show support for the president.

Olympians from the 2018 Games have been invited to go to the White House today. I will not be going. I will not stand with people who discriminate against those that they perceive as different. In lieu of going to DC, I have donated to a few of my favorite causes 🙆🏼‍♂️❤️ https://t.co/qDXqswTHdF — Adam Rippon (@Adaripp) April 27, 2018

2017 Philadelphia Eagles

Less than 24 hours before he was scheduled to host the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles at the White House in June 2018, Trump withdrew the invitation.

Trump said he rescinded the invitation because several players had said they would not attend and their fans who had planned to attend the event ""deserve better.""

Some of the players who had vowed not to go had voiced support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, whose act of kneeling during the national anthem in protest of police shootings of African-Americans had drawn Trump's ire.

""The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow,"" Trump said in a statement. ""They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.""

Golden State Warriors/Cleveland Cavaliers 2018

The same week he disinvited the Eagles, Trump declared that he would not invite either the Cleveland Cavaliers or the Warriors, as the two teams battled in the NBA Finals.

""I didn't invite LeBron James, and I didn't invite Steph Curry. We're not going to invite either team,"" Trump told reporters. James had long been an outspoken critic of Trump.

The Warriors, who went on to sweep the Cavaliers in four games, instead ended up squeezing in a visit with Obama during a trip to Washington in January.

3 members of 2018 Patriots

So far, three members of the New England Patriots have said they will decline if the White House extends an invitation to honor their February Super Bowl victory.

""They don’t want me in the White House,"" Duron Harmon told TMZ. But he said ""it would be dope"" to celebrate with Obama.

""Obama, come holler at me, man. We love you over here, man,"" he said.

Defensive back Devin McCourty said he will not attend and his twin brother, Jason McCourty, says it is very unlikely he would go.

How Clemson Can Sign the Best Recruiting Class in CFB History,"Mike Stewart/Associated Press

Although signing day is still months away, no college football program owns a hotter recruiting streak than Clemson.

Since the beginning of April, Dabo Swinney's staff has landed commitments from a quartet of 5-star prospects and one of the highest-rated 4-stars in the 2020 class. The Tigers have surged atop the rankings for the cycle, and they're not finished.

The evidence points to continued excellence in the near future. Several other 5-stars and top-ranked 4-stars hold offers from the ACC powerhouse and have Clemson atop their interest lists.

This could be the best recruiting class ever. And that's not hyperbole.

Urban Meyer currently owns the title, no matter which way you measure it. His 28-man 2010 class at Florida garnered a total score of 324.62, per the 247Sports composite rankings. On a per-player basis, the 2017 Ohio State haul stands atop the record books.

Thanks to this recent surge, Clemson is poised to challenge the latter.

Over a 28-day span from April 8 to May 5, the Tigers averaged one 5-star pledge per week―a pretty decent rate. Cornerback Fred Davis II kicked off the streak, followed by defensive lineman Bryan Bresee, running back Demarkcus Bowman and quarterback DJ Uiagalelei. Clemson also added RJ Mickens―the No. 1 safety in this cycle―two days before Davis' commitment.

As if that isn't impressive enough, a trio of top-10 talents reportedly have Clemson in their group of finalists.

Ranked fifth nationally, defensive end Jordan Burch is trending toward the Tigers. Wide receiver Julian Fleming, the No. 6 prospect, placed Clemson in his final six. Finally, Myles Murphy is scheduled to reveal his college choice May 17. As of this writing, all 13 predictions on 247Sports expect the No. 8 overall defensive end to pick Clemson.

According to the 247Sports class calculator, landing that trio would vault Clemson past a total score of 300. But even if only Burch and Murphy commit, the Tigers will remain in great position to make a run at 2017 Ohio State.

Clemson has a limited number of spots for this cycle because it took 29 players in 2019. Early indications are the Tigers have 20 to 22 scholarships available, and they'll fall short of 2010 Florida because of that lower volume.

Landing two 5-stars is essential to chasing down 2017 Ohio State.

The necessary asterisk is that the following information is based on the latest reports, and recruiting news changes every day. These are 17- and 18-year-olds who are being bombarded with praise and attention and opportunities to travel all over the country. Today's perception may be irrelevant next month.

At this moment, though, Clemson sits in a favorable position with running back Kobe Pryor, wide receiver E.J. Williams and safety Tyler Venables―the son of defensive coordinator Brent Venables. Those pledges would change the average prospect rating to .9501.

The final touches on the class hold the intrigue. Swinney and Co. would likely be eyeing some combination of a tight end, wide receiver and linebacker for the closing spots.

If the Tigers grab Fleming, he'll secure the record. If they land wideout Xzavier Henderson, it'll be a cozy finish.

David J. Phillip/Associated Press

Clemson is thin on top-rated targets at tight end―Diego LaMonica, ranked No. 1,307 nationally, is emerging as a top option―so a senior-year rating bump may provide the difference between surpassing Ohio State and falling short.

That applies to the entire class.

Each of the major recruiting services will tweak rankings after summer camps and again following the fall season. Some of these pledges will rise, while others may fall. Given that nobody has decommitted from Clemson since 2016―yes, for real―there shouldn't be much movement outside of adding to the group.

Provided the Tigers land two 5-stars, the most important changes will otherwise happen within the current commits. Earning a boost to their ratings can seal Clemson's place in history.

While high recruiting rankings are the best indicator of success, nothing is guaranteed. That should be understood in 2019.

Regardless of the result―whether the 2020 class tops Ohio State or not―the main takeaway is clear: Clemson has never recruited this effectively. After the Tigers' two national titles in the last three years, that should terrify the rest of college football.

"No, just no. Viral doorbell camera video shows 5-foot-long snake attacking man's face","A doorbell camera captured the moment a snake bit an unsuspecting man in the face.

The viral video from Sunday's attack shows Jerel Heywood opening a screen door to a friend's house in Lawton, Oklahoma.

A snake suddenly leaps from the bottom left corner of the video and bites Heywood's head.

He grimaces in pain and screams an expletive while clutching his face.

""Take me to the hospital!"" Heywood shouts. ""I just got bit by a snake!""

Rodney Copeland, the owner of the house, told CNN he watched in horror as Heywood stumbled through the door.

""I was in shock,"" Copeland told CNN. ""That could've been any one of us.""

The 5-foot-long snake was wrapped around a porch light, CNN reported.

Copeland took Heywood to the hospital for treatment. Copeland's son, Mashawn, told local station KOCO 5 that Heywood was doing fine. The attacking bullsnake was not poisonous, he added.

""No stitches, thankfully, but they cleaned me up pretty good,"" Heywood told CNN. ""I am on antibiotics.""

Additional videos posted by Mashawn Copeland on social media show a neighbor pummeling the snake to death with a hammer after knocking it off the porch light.

Screams from Heywood and Rodney Copeland's wife brought him over, Copeland told CNN.

Copeland had never spotted a snake in his home before, he told CNN, adding he thinks it was taking shelter from recent heavy rains. He plans to spray his yard with sulfuric acid to ward away future reptiles.

""I hear they don't like that,"" he said.

Former Cape Coral resident now leading the ATF. She's the first woman to head the agency,"The new acting deputy director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — the first woman to head the federal agency — has her heart in Southwest Florida despite leading an agency based in Washington, D.C.

Regina Lombardo, 56 and known to everyone as ""Reggie"", looks fondly on her days in Fort Myers and Cape Coral when she worked in her parent's deli, was competitive in high school sports and modeled hairstyles for a top local stylist.

""It's been a ride,"" she said Tuesday, adding that the first female acting director aspect ""feels really profound.""

Lombardo said being the first female was never at the forefront of why she was at ATF.

""It's an agency that regulates gun laws,"" she said, and not really a place a lot of women generally think of or naturally gravitate to.

""I hope to change that,"" she said. ""I feel humble and proud. I hope to be a role model. You can't be what you can't see.""

The ATF protects communities from violent criminals, criminal organizations, the illegal use and trafficking of firearms, the illegal use and storage of explosives, acts of arson and bombings, acts of terrorism, and the illegal diversion of alcohol and tobacco products

Attorney General William P. Barr announced Lombardo's appointment April 24 and she was sworn-in as head of the agency on Wednesday, replacing retiring Deputy Director Thomas Brandon.

In a statement, Barr said Lombardo has proven herself an outstanding leader.

""She is well qualified to continue ATF's successes of recent years, including helping the Department investigate and prosecute more firearms offenders than ever before,"" he said.

Lombardo, speaking from ATF headquarters in Washington, D.C., said her heart is usually split between Southwest Florida and New York, where her family originally settled.

Where the heart is

""I still fight with that,"" she said. ""I go back to where my family is, where my heart is. When I go back to Fort Myers, it makes me feel peaceful. It still feels like home.""

Still, she loves her New York travels.

She also considers her path to the ATF a bit unorthodox, going from a family that had a legitimate liquor business to an agency that targets illicit liquor activities.

The Lombardos have roots that go deep into New York's past — she said one part of the family has the second liquor license issued — and they operated a wine and liquor business in East Harlem in the 1920s.

""We took out what we knew and brought it to Fort Myers,"" she said.

No surprise to mom

Her promotion to the top came as no surprise to her mom, Milly Lombardo, 86, and older sister Rosemarie Lombardo, 63, both of whom still live in Southwest Florida.

""Mom is excited, and proud ... and worried,"" Rosemarie Lombardo said. She then added with a chuckle: ""She's not worried about the criminals, she's worried about Washington D.C.""

Rosemarie Lombardo, oldest of the four Lombardo children, said her little sister was no ballerina type.

""She was rough and tumble,"" she said. ""She was a very hard worker and determined. But she was friendly and sociable too.""

Rosemarie Lombardo said her sister worked at the family business in Cape Coral, Lombardo's Italian Deli and Bakery, started in New York by their grandparents.

Reggie Lombardo said the deli here first opened as an Italian food shop in Fort Myers on U.S. 41 and moved to the larger deli location in Cape Coral in 1979. Her parents closed it at the end of 2000.

""I don't think work (at the deli) was her first passion,"" Rosemarie Lombardo said.

That restaurant experience obviously stayed with her, Rosemarie Lombardo said. ""She is an avid cook,"" she said. ""She knows her food.""

Reggie Lombardo readily agreed.

""One of my passions is to cook,"" she said. ""That's where my creative side comes out.""

Her sister said Reggie Lombardo, along with her brother, Raphael, were also interested in dancing and would serve as hair style models when top local stylist Valentino did hair shows.

""We competed in disco and danced at the Edison pageant,"" Reggie Lombardo said.

Just a year apart in age from her brother, his death in 1996 devastated her.

""It was the greatest heartbreak of my life,"" she said.

Carolyn Rogers, of Fort Myers, said she and Lombardo went to school together, graduating from Bishop Verot High School in Fort Myers in 1981.

""My heart is full of pride for her today,"" Rogers said.

She remembers when the Lombardos moved to Cape Coral in the 1970s, the new ATF head was in fourth grade and the city was still fairly unpopulated.

""There was no more than 10,000 people living there,"" Rogers said.

Rogers remembered Lombardo working at the family business for a number of years.

""She’s beautiful, kind and amazing,"" she said. ""And quite an athlete in her day.""

Reggie Lombardo went to college assisted by a softball scholarship.

She figured out her future in college segueing from education to law and then to law enforcement.

""Not a lot of women wanted to work on bombs and explosives,"" she said. ""It was more of a challenge. That's what triggered me to focus.""

The new director is close to the mandatory retirement age for federal agency workers — 57 — but an extension isn't outside the realm of possibilities.

""Whatever role they want me to play,"" she said. ""I am willing, no discussions.""

"After regular Baker Act committals, treatment program helps Naples teen","Caleb Caldwell’s delicate peace with himself wavered earlier this year when a violent outburst nearly led to a mental health evaluation under Florida’s Baker Act — yet again.

The 19-year-old from Naples had skipped some of the medications he takes to treat symptoms of his bipolar disorder and got into an argument with his mother and brother.

“He was being very violent. And he did put his hands on me,” said his mother, Mellisa Caldwell. “He just gets really out of hand. He does. And he’s a big guy.”

But given the troubles of Caleb’s life, the fact this lapse was not worse is something of a victory.

Caleb, an otherwise soft-spoken young man who finally landed a paying job and hopes to work in sports medicine, spent most of his early and mid-adolescence in and out of mental health crisis units.

It was before his condition had been fully diagnosed, and his prescribed medication was wanting.

He was bullied. He had violent outbursts at home and at school. He regularly threatened suicide. And at one point, he was getting committed under the Baker Act nearly every other week.

The boy’s troubling behavior, his later mood swings and propensity to violence — seemingly without remorse — even prompted one psychiatrist to tell the Naples family that the boy had “sociopathic criminal potential.”

So much happened, and so much of it seems like a blur to Caleb.

“A lot of this has been going on for so long that I don’t remember a lot,” Caleb said.

Then, when he was 16, after one of his threats to kill himself and another Baker Act evaluation at the David Lawrence Center in East Naples, real progress: a new diagnosis and treatment plan that seemed to better address his behavior problems.

It turns out that Caleb, now 19, was on the autism spectrum, something multiple mental health professionals he encountered failed to notice, according to his family. He got different medications and found a mental health counselor who is helping him control his impulses.

He soon got an internship with the NCH Baker Downtown Hospital as part of the Project SEARCH program, which helps find jobs for teens and young adults with developmental disabilities.

Before his last behavioral lapse — the first serious one in years — Caleb said he hoped those days were behind him.

“There are times when I have some issues, but it doesn’t get to that point anymore,” he said.

But the family knows there will never be a treatment silver bullet. Caleb's problems will never just go away.

They consider themselves lucky because of the help from the David Lawrence Center and that they have the means to aggressively work to find him treatment. But they worry about Caleb's future.

He is transitioning into the working world. He still lives with his parents, but if he is committed under the Baker Act again, now as an adult, law enforcement officers would not be required to contact them.

Mellisa Caldwell is trying to establish legal guardianship of him into adulthood. Caleb isn't quite sure what he thinks about that.

“I feel like there are times that I need it,"" he said. ""But I think there are times when I need my own space and think I’m fine on my own. But I do think there are times — like when I get Baker Acted – what would I have done if she wasn’t there?""

Brazen burglars scared off by family's security system,"<p>A Fort Lauderdale homeowner cut short a brazen break-in at his house early Monday from across the country, thanks to his home security system.</p>

<p>His family feels violated, but they're thankful they had a security system that actually scared off the burglars who had forced their way inside.</p>

<p>The man, who owns the Fort Lauderdale home where the video was taken, did not want to be identified, but he said he was out of town for business when burglars showed up in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>""We got a call from the alarm company at around 3 a.m., telling us that the alarm had gone off. We have cameras inside the house. We looked, and everything seemed normal,"" the homeowner said.</p>

<p>So they told the alarm company it was a false alarm, but an hour later, the company called again.</p>

<p>""So we looked at the camera and there they were,"" the homeowner said.</p>

<p>In the video, the burglars can be seen trying to smash something. It was a door that was outfitted with impact glass. The burglars never got through it.</p>

<p>Instead, they ripped down the cameras, pried open a window and climbed inside. </p>

<p>One of the men went to the master bedroom. The other spotted the alarm system and tried to disable it, but he was unsuccessful. With the alarm blaring, the men scrambled back through the window and out of the house. </p>

<p>Now, the Fort Lauderdale police are looking for them, and the homeowner has a message.</p>

<p>""Hey, guys, there's a lot of cameras out there. Doing this thing is pretty dangerous. So hope we catch these guys,"" he said.</p>

<p>Anyone with information about the burglary is asked to contact Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS.<br />

Suspect arrested in New York in connection with Miami Beach homicide,"Nicholas Brent Gibson, 32, was arrested May 5 in New York City in connection with the killing of Erik B. Stocker, 77, in Miami Beach.

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - A suspect has been arrested in New York days after a 77-year-old man was found dead inside his apartment in Miami Beach, authorities confirmed Monday.

According to Miami Beach police spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez, Erik B. Stocker was killed at least 10 days before his body was found last Tuesday inside his unit at the Tribeca apartments at 1508 Michigan Ave.

Rodriguez said the suspect was quickly identified as Nicholas Brent Gibson, 32, who was also wanted by the U.S. Marshals Service for a probation violation for failing to register as a sex offender.

Miami Beach police detectives learned that Gibson had traveled to New York City and alerted the New York Police Department and the U.S. Marshals Service, Rodriguez said.

He said some Miami Beach detectives also traveled to New York Friday to search for Gibson.

Gibson was taken into custody Sunday in Manhattan by NYPD transit police officers.

Rodriguez said there was a struggle during his arrest and at least one officer was injured.

Gibson will eventually be extradited to Miami to face charges in the killing of Stocker.

Rodriguez said he may also face charges in New York City for assaulting police officers during his arrest and for resisting arrest.

""The MBPD is extremely grateful for the support and assistance provided to us by the U.S. Marshals' Miami and New York offices and the NYPD's Intelligence Bureau, Transit Bureau and Detective Bureau,"" Rodriguez said in an email. ""We are particularly thankful for the effort made by the transit police officers who struggled with this dangerous suspect and took him into custody.""

Detectives have not said how Stocker was killed or released a motive for the killing.

The members of the upstate New York group called Nxivm looked up to Keith Raniere as a leader who spread his ideas on how to achieve success and happiness, but prosecutors say, he was actually a conman who took advantage of vulnerable people.""He targeted people who were looking to improve their lives,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Tanya Hajjar in her opening statement Tuesday at Raniere's trial in New York City. ""Once he gained their trust he took advantage of them. The defendant said that he was a mentor, but he was a predator.""Raniere, 58, has been charged with racketeering, sex trafficking, sexual exploitation of children and human trafficking, among other offenses. He has been held in federal custody in Brooklyn since his arrest in Mexico in March 2018. On Tuesday, he appeared in court wearing a gray sweater with a button down shirt, seated next to his attorney Marc Agnifilo.""I certainly agree with one thing,"" Agnifilo said in his own opening statement, in response to claims raised by the prosecution. ""You are going to hear the truth.""Agnifilo argued that the prosecution's own witnesses will testify that they loved being part of Nxivm -- an organization that prosecutors have deemed a pyramid scheme but others call a cult.Nearly 17,000 people took the self-help classes that Nxivm offered, Agnifilo said, and he urged the 12 jurors to look at the facts of the case through Raniere's perspective.Raniere's five other co-defendants have pleaded guilty and might testify against their former mentor. Seagram liquor heiress Clare Bronfman, ""Smallville"" actress Allison Mack, Kathy Russell, Lauren Salzman and Nancy Salzman have pleaded guilty to crimes ranging from visa fraud to racketeering.One former Nxivm member, identified only as Sylvie to protect her identity, began testifying Tuesday afternoon about coercion she said she experienced while part of the organization.Raniere has pleaded not guilty to all charges. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.Recruits provided 'collateral' information, prosecutors sayNxivm, created by Raniere in 2003, exploited recruits ""both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants' benefit,"" said U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue.An affidavit prepared by an FBI agent that was filed in support of the arrest warrant said Nxivm was based in upstate New York and operated like a multilevel marketing scheme, pushing members to take classes that cost as much as $5,000.It encouraged members to take more classes to move up the ranks and to recruit other members to help create more revenue, which left some members in debt to Nxivm itself, the affidavit said.The members in Nxivm called themselves ""Nxians,"" and wore different colored sashes that signified their ranks, the affidavit said. They signed nondisclosure agreements and promised not to reveal certain things about Nxivm's teachings, the affidavit said.Within the group was a secret society called DOS that prosecutors say consisted of dozens of women who were ""masters"" or ""slaves."" The affidavit said DOS masters went after recruits who were ""experiencing difficulties"" in their lives.While recruiting them, the masters would insist the recruits provide information about themselves as ""collateral,"" to encourage the recruits to keep information about DOS a secret, the affidavit said.The collateral included sexually explicit photos, videos in which the member tells damaging stories about themselves and letters making damaging statements against friends or family, the affidavit said.DOS had a pyramid structure, with Raniere at the top as the highest master and the only male, the affidavit said.Women who served as ""slaves"" were expected to complete tasks for their masters, and could be punished if they failed, the affidavit said. The affidavit said some slaves were expected to have sex with Raniere and stick to extremely low-calorie diets to stay thin -- because Rainere liked thin women.In one of the most bizarre allegations, some DOS members were branded with a cauterizing pen on their pubic regions in ceremonies that were recorded and could take half an hour, the affidavit said.""Some DOS victims were told that the brand stood for the four elements (the lines represented air, earth, and water and the cauterizing pen represented sealing with fire),"" the affidavit said. ""Based on information obtained during the course of the investigation, however, it is clear that the brand in fact consisted of Rainere's initials.""The man at the topRaniere's mission was teaching others about how to achieve true happiness, said his lawyer, Agnifilo.""Part of what I feel I have to prove is that Keith Raniere is not a monster,"" Agnifilo said. ""He's a well-intentioned person who spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how to help people be happier.""Raniere denies Nxivm is a cult, Agnifilo said.""He's nervous that the case has created a lot of what he views as sort of prejudice against him and his ideas,"" Angifilo said. ""He firmly believes his ideas are sound ideas, are good ideas, are humanitarian ideas.""He thinks DOS is a good idea and is a pro-woman group. He created it to have women have their own society ... where men would play no role.""Before starting Nxivm, Raniere had founded a company called Executive Success Programs which was supposed to ""actualize human potential,"" said the affidavit.Is Nxivm really a cult?Prosecutors don't go as far as to call the group a cult in court filings.But cult expert and former cult member Janja Lalich -- who was not a member of Nxivm and is not a witness in the trial -- says it ""absolutely"" is a cult, which she defines as a group or social movement with a shared devotion to a charismatic, authoritarian leader that's structured in such a way that it asserts influence and control over its members to keep them under their control. She believes this is the biggest trial of a purported cult leader in nearly a decade.""The Nxivm courses were used as a way to draw people into the more restricted and more perverse inner circles, including DOS,"" Lalich said. ""In a sense, Nxivm is a front to draw people in to be able to target certain people and pull them in further and further.""Lalich said that most people who become involved with cults were recruited as members by family or friends. And once inside, it became difficult to leave.Actress Catherine Oxenberg, a former star on the TV show ""Dynasty,"" also thinks Nxivm is a cult. Oxenberg was able to get her daughter, India, out of the group. She had no comment on if India was asked to testify in the trial.Mother and daughter started taking Nxivm classes in 2011, thinking they would learn about entrepreneurship, Catherine Oxenberg said in an email to CNN. India became more engrossed in the classes and moved from Los Angeles to Nxivm's upstate New York headquarters, her mother said.""One of the most deeply evil tricks of cults, Nxivm/DOS in particular, is that they hide behind the veneer of choice, even choices many rightly say are virtuous,"" Catherine Oxenberg said. ""But in cults such 'choices' only serve the perverted goals of the leader.""Testifying could be 'empowering but devastating'Bronfman, Mack, Russell, Lauren Salzman and Nancy Salzman were accused of serious crimes of their own, including prosecutors' allegation that they ""were aware of and facilitated Raniere's sexual relationship with two underage victims,"" including a 15-year-old girl. Dozens of child pornography images are part of the evidence.Mack, 36, pleaded guilty in April to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges and faces up to 40 years in prison. She was a DOS master and helped co-found DOS, which was targeted toward actors, prosecutors said.Bronfman, who served on Nxivm's executive board for nearly a decade, used her wealth to help finance Nxivm's activities, prosecutors said. She tearfully pleaded guilty in April to concealing and harboring undocumented immigrants for financial gain and fraudulent use of identification. She faces up to 27 months in prison and agreed to pay $6 million in forfeiture to the government.Lalich said she has spoken with about a dozen former Nxivm members, and believes it will be difficult for Raniere's former followers to face him in court, especially those who have recently pleaded guilty.""It'll feel empowering but it'll also be devastating,"" Lalich said. ""I'm hoping that the attorneys have a good support system set up for all of those women.""Agnifilo told CNN he believes that if any of the women who have pleaded guilty testify against Raniere, it would only help his case, and that Raniere has repeatedly told his attorney that he hopes his co-defendants don't have to serve prison time.""I think they're going to be important witnesses for both sides,"" Agnifilo said. ""I think they're going to give an accurate, balanced perspective.""",https://www.wpbf.com/article/sex-cult-leader-on-trial-says-he-just-wanted-to-create-a-secret-society-of-women/27407763,2019-05-08T17:11:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA"
"Recruiting mailbag: What's the latest for Iowa, Iowa State in the transfer market?","CLOSE Jalen Suggs looked every bit like a five-star, top-10 prospect at the Under Armour Association Session II in Kansas City. Matthew Bain, mbain@dmreg.com

Before we get to the mailbag, some junior college recruiting news: Indian Hills guard Tomas Woldetensae has committed to Virginia over the likes of Illinois, UCF and others.

The 6-foot-5 sharpshooter knocked down 47.6 percent of his 3-balls last season, and he projects to contribute immediately to the reigning national champion.

Right after after that news came out, I got this question on Twitter:

""Is there a reason Fran (McCaffery) wasn't looking at this guy?""

Iowa was not recruiting Woldetensae. And, of course, hindsight is 20/20, but you'd have to think an immediately eligible, nearly 50-percent shooter with length on the perimeter could help a team with three open scholarships and a lack of shooting guard depth.

Again, though, hindsight is 20/20. Iowa wasn't in its current predicament during the height of Woldetensae's recruitment. If it was, maybe it gives him a call.

You can wonder the same thing about Iowa State, too. The Cyclones came to watch Woldetensae in October, but the interest never really developed.

Teams have different needs and different types of players in mind when they look for additions to their rosters, and I'm sure both staffs had their reasons for not seriously pursuing Woldetensae.

But, man, it sure feels like this guy could've helped either team in the 2019-20 season.

Now, let's get to this week's questions.

What transfers do (the Cyclones) realistically have a chance at getting for 2019? — @markallendaniel

Iowa State is involved with three transfers right now — two sit-outs and one graduate.

The newest name is Penn State combo guard Rasir Norton, who is set for an official visit with the Cyclones this weekend. He was one of the Big Ten's best freshmen last year, averaging 11.6 points, two rebounds and 1.5 assists per game. Assistant coach William Small is the point man, and this relationship has developed quite quickly since the end of April. There's momentum here. I'm not aware of other visits or heavy interest for Norton. So, at this point, I'd say Iowa State is in a good spot.

Then there's Troy wing Javan Johnson, who will begin his official visit to Ames on Thursday. Johnson, a 6-7 sophomore, averaged 10.4 points last year. The Cyclones have been involved for a while. I'm told Arkansas and Clemson are in the mix, too.

Arkansas-Little Rock guard Rayjon Tucker is still the big graduate transfer that Steve Prohm and Co. are recruiting. He was on campus last week. Memphis, Auburn and Kansas are among the other schools in the picture. Based on competition, this might be the toughest nut to crack for Iowa State.

Grad transfers, who are (the Hawkeyes) linked to? — @aaronlyons24

This week hasn't been as kind to the Hawkeyes.

Notre Dame wing transfer D.J. Harvey, who officially visited Iowa last week, committed to Vanderbilt on Tuesday. Stadium's Jeff Goodman also reported Marquette transfers Sam and Joey Hauser would decide among Virginia, Michigan State and Wisconsin, leaving Iowa out of the picture.

Odds were always slim the Hausers would sign with Iowa, but there was thought Harvey, who played his AAU ball with Luka Garza, could wind up in Iowa City.

Coach Stackhouse and the coaching staff at Vanderbilt have something brewing over in Tennessee! Can’t wait to be apart of it... blessed and excited to say that I’ve committed to Vanderbilt University pic.twitter.com/pl6Kni9Uqd — DJ Harvey (@TheRealDJHarvey) May 7, 2019

Now, getting to the question: I haven't heard of Iowa being tied to any graduate transfers at the moment. And with Isaiah Moss' transfer, immediate help — especially at shooting guard — would greatly benefit the Hawkeyes.

Fran McCaffery's track record suggests he wouldn't go after a grad transfer. We'll see if he makes an exception in this case.

But this is important: Iowa won't add a recruit just to fill a scholarship. Especially with a grad transfer, the player would need to project as an immediate contributor.

The problem is that many of the country's best grad transfers who could make an instant impact in the Big Ten already have an established list of suitors. That doesn't mean Iowa can't jump in, but it might be difficult to make significant progress.

That's just with the current group in the transfer portal. If new grad transfers sprout up in the coming weeks, Iowa could have better odds with one of those.

Another option is to recruit remaining high school prospects. But, again, the kid would need to be an under-the-radar gem; Iowa isn't looking to just to add a body to the roster.

Ultimately, the Hawkeyes may hold onto the three open spots and focus on 2020.

If that's the case, the 2020 class would need to be big — in number and in impact. Iowa currently has seven open scholarships for that class. That's a daunting number, even with C.J. Fredrick, Jack Nunge and Cordell Pemsl redshirting. Remember when we talked about how those redshirts eased the burden on Iowa's 2020 recruitment?

Well ... if Iowa carries those three scholarships over, that burden is back.

Is Iowa getting involved again with PG Bryan Greenlee out of Florida with the Moss departure? — @hawkeye1992

Iowa offered Florida product Bryan Greenlee late last summer when it was still trying to add a 2019 point guard. That recruitment ended when New York product Joe Toussaint picked the Hawkeyes on Sept. 8.

I messaged Greenlee on Tuesday, and he said Iowa is not currently recruiting him. He recently took an official visit to Illinois State and is still considering his options.

If Iowa does look to another 2019 piece, it likely wouldn't be a point guard. It's pretty secure at that position next year with Jordan Bohannon, Connor McCaffery and Toussaint, and it's targeting a few high-level options in 2020.

What are you hearing on (Chase) Courbat, (Michael) Duax, and (Angelo) Winkel for the 2021 class? — @PoptartLudwig

For those who don't know, Cedar Falls power forward Chase Courbat is the Register's No. 1 in-state 2021 basketball prospect, Dubuque Hempstead guard/wing Michael Duax is No. 5 and Bishop Garrigan power forward Angelo Winkel is No. 7.

Drake kept a close eye on Courbat and Duax during the April live evaluation period, when they both played at a high level. They're also on Iowa and Northern Iowa's radars.

Winkel is also on the in-state radar. He didn't play during April's live period so I don't have as much recent information on him, but schools like his potential. One of the keys moving forward for Winkel, a bouncy 6-8 big, is consistency. He has the talent to be a top-five kid in Iowa's 2021 class.

What do you think about Pettway transferring in from Arkansas? — @ted_rood

He's a great get.

As our Randy Peterson wrote, Pettway won't be expected to duplicate what Butler did in Ames. But he does project as an instant-impact receiver who can do some good things.

Richard Davenport, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette's recruiting reporter, has followed Pettway both at Nashville High in Nashville, Arkansas, and at the university.

""Big, physical kid who is a good blocker,"" Davenport told me about Pettway. ""Kind of a guy that should know the ropes and should be able to pick things up pretty quickly, versus a guy that maybe is or first- or second-year guy transferring in.

""This will be his fifth year. He could be one of those guys that catches 30, 40, 50 balls and really makes a difference.""

Bottom line: Pettway is a proven veteran, big-bodied, 6-3 receiver with Power Five experience. Any time you can add a guy like that, you're happy — especially when you're looking for someone to fill Butler's spot in the offense.

Any idea when either (Xavier Foster) or guys like (Jalen) Suggs would commit? They have a timetable? — @RyanFitzgerald1

During the April live period, Oskaloosa five-star power forward Xavier Foster told me he plans to see how his recruitment plays out this spring and summer, perhaps take some more official visits in the late summer/early fall and then decide during his senior year.

I haven't heard plans that specific from Minneapolis five-star point guard Jalen Suggs, but I'd imagine he'll be a senior-year commitment, too. He still has so much to consider, as he's also a four-star quarterback. And he's got a decent shot to add some blue-blood offers this summer, too.

Matthew, is there still a chance Iowa comes in late in (Bowen) Born do you think? — @CoachDelaney6

My personal opinion: Yes.

As I've been writing for a while, Born is a similar prospect to Bohannon when he came out of Linn-Mar in 2016. And remember: Iowa didn't offer its current point guard until August before his senior year.

Iowa is monitoring Born. Dominoes would need to fall before it'd offer, but we'll see.

McCaffery's program isn't the only high-major watching Born. Creighton visited him at Norwalk last Thursday. The Blue Jays haven't offered, but they've shown interest in the lefty point guard since early fall.

Give me something to feel optimistic about as an Iowa basketball fan. — @racecarpassenger

Like I said earlier in this mailbag: Recruiting success can come in a flurry, and bad stuff can come in a flurry, too. It happens, and Iowa basketball is going through the ringer right now, losing Moss and missing on Harvey and the Hausers.

This is college basketball.

This stuff ebbs and flows.

The Hawkeyes' downward patch won't last forever. Iowa Basketball Land isn't coming to an end. That might be a cold comfort, but it's the truth. Iowa can generate some momentum when it announces the hiring of its third assistant coach.

Bradenton police forcibly remove NAACP leader from meeting,"Chief denied accusations that officers had Rodney Jones' home under surveillance

BRADENTON — Police forcibly removed Rodney Jones, president of the Manatee County chapter of the NAACP, from a Bradenton City Council meeting Wednesday morning. Jones refused to surrender the podium when he exceeded a time limit for public comments and struggled with officers who escorted him out. Officers said they would charge him with disorderly conduct.

Jones appeared before the council to complain that undercover officers in unmarked cars had his home under surveillance for several hours on the night of April 22.

“I feel like my life is in danger,” Jones told council members. He said such police activities are being conducted against “civil rights” leaders across the nation.

His 15-year-old daughter is living elsewhere because he does not want her to be in jeopardy, Jones said. Jones told the council that his complaints to the Police Department had fallen “on deaf ears.” Jones appealed to Mayor Wayne Poston, the city’s police commissioner, to look into his allegations. Poston told Jones that Police Chief Bevan had investigated his complaint and determined that it was not valid.

Bevan offered to talk with Jones outside the chambers but he refused.

Jones remained at the podium and continued talking when told he exceeded the three-minute limit on public comment.

“I’m not stopping,” Jones said. An officer came to the podium to tell him that he had to leave the podium. “Man, don’t touch me,” Jones said as officers grabbed his arms to lead him out.

Bevan and two officers forcibly escorted Jones from the council chamber.

“Poston, you’re going to get yours,” Jones said as he was taken into the hallway.

Officers said afterward that they took Jones into the police department, which is in the same complex as City Hall, to book him on a disorderly conduct charge.

Later in the meeting, Bevan assured council members that she investigates “any and all allegations of wrongdoing” by officers.

Jones ran for a Manatee County School Board seat in 2014, losing to Charlie Kennedy. The Manatee Education Association endorsed him.

When a candidate, he reported that his background included being a clinical manager at Manatee Glens, a mental health clinic now known as Centerstone; running youth delinquency programs in Hardee and DeSoto Counties; working at State College of Florida as a project manager for a short-term grant; and serving on the school district's Citizen's Budget Advisory Committee.",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190508/bradenton-police-forcibly-remove-naacp-leader-from-council-meeting?rssfeed=true,2019-05-08T10:48:30Z,Sarasota Herald,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA"
Hidden in Plain Sight: Massage Parlors Selling Sex in Massachusetts,"A website advertises, in graphic detail, what supposedly is happening inside massage parlors in the business of selling sex.

What to Know Hidden in plain sight in Massachusetts and across the U.S. are massage parlors allegedly engaging in human sex trafficking.

The estimated billion-dollar illicit sex business is fueled by websites like RubMaps, a guide to places allegedly offering sex for money.

According to the reviews on RubMaps, 240 parlors in Massachusetts are offering or have offered sex services.

They are near pizza shops, coffee shops and schools — massage parlors that are offering more than just a massage. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey says they are in the business of selling sex.

Patriots owner Robert Kraft stands accused of soliciting prostitution from such a massage parlor in Florida. He denies the charges. But lost in the headlines of the Florida arrests are the stories of the victims, the girls and women forced into prostitution.

After the Kraft arrest, the NBC10 Boston Investigators started digging and found similar situations in Massachusetts, hidden in plain sight.

One Massachusetts woman agreed to tell her story with the hope of bringing awareness to what she says is everyone's role in perpetuating or preventing sex trafficking.

Raised in Tibet in a refugee camp, Phuni Kim Meston's parents were nomads who didn't speak English. She says she remembers the first time a minister from Northborough, Massachusetts, came to her camp.

""When I first met him, I was 12 or 13,"" Meston recalled.

She says the minister promised her an education and told her parents that ""he would treat me like his daughter and that I was really too smart to stay in the village.""

But Meston says that's not at all what happened.

Landing in Massachusetts at age 14, she went from a refugee camp in Tibet to a victim of international sex trafficking.

Prosecutors say she was subjected to ""years of forced sex"" and ""torture.""

Arizona Students Demand ICE Release Undocumented Classmate

Dozens of Tucson, Arizona, high school students walked out of class Monday morning and marched in the name of a classmate taken into Border Patrol custody last Thursday. Thomas Torres, a senior and football player at Desert View High School, was taken in by Border Patrol agents following a traffic stop. (Published Tuesday, May 7, 2019)

Meston says the minister used threats to control her and coerce her.

""I felt like I was a servant there, not to mention in the night, and he did other stuff. He told me, 'No one will believe you, even the school.' He told me my parents will go to jail in India,"" she said.

Meston later testified at the trial of the minister. He was convicted of rape and indecent assault and battery in 1992. He spent four years in prison.

In Boston, not every victim of sex trafficking comes from across the world.

Of the nearly 160 girls helped by My Life, My Choice, a Boston non-profit that helps get girls out of sex trafficking, many are American-born.

""The vast majority of people being trafficked here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are kids who've grown up here in our neighborhoods,"" said Lisa Goldblatt Grace, director of My Life, My Choice.

Burning Plane Lands at Moscow Airport; At Least 40 Dead

A passenger plane was forced to make an emergency landing after it burst into flames shortly after takeoff. (Published Sunday, May 5, 2019)

Police raids have rescued girls who were being forced to engage in sex for money from massage parlors in Beverly, Medford, Lynn and Quincy.

Grace says it is prevalent in the suburbs.

""We could tell you stories of young people we've served in Brookline, Lexington, Newton, and Wayland,"" she said.

Of the 160 girls that My Life, My Choice has helped, the average age is 14, and 85 percent are part of the state's child welfare system.

""These young people that are being exploited this way are hidden in plain sight,"" said Grace. ""They're in our schools, showing up to appointments with their primary care physician, they're in our child welfare offices.""

They may be hidden in plain sight, but they're not all that difficult to find.

The estimated billion-dollar illicit sex business is fueled in part by websites like RubMaps, a literal guide to places allegedly offering sex for money.

The website publishes reviews, in graphic detail, of what is supposedly happening inside certain massage parlors.

According to the reviews, 240 parlors in Massachusetts are offering or have offered sex services.

Each review explains the sex acts allegedly available and how much to tip for sex, giving readers in-depth details of the experience.

NBC10 Boston investigators used mapping software and found 35 of the listed massage parlors were located 1,000 feet or less from schools.

Police say their investigations of these parlors is difficult because the women often fear deportation, and many don't speak English.

UNC Charlotte Student Died Tackling Gunman

Investigators in the shooting that killed two at the University of North Carolina Charlotte called Riley Howell a hero, after the 21-year-old college junior died tackling the gunman to stop the shooting. (Published Thursday, May 2, 2019)

RubMaps did not respond to the NBC10 Boston Investigators' repeated requests for comment.

Healey has made prosecuting sex trafficking a priority. She has created a special unit that includes five state troopers and attorneys, among other staff, and has prosecuted more than 50 cases in the last few years.

""We've seen that human trafficking is the fastest-growing criminal enterprise worldwide,"" Healey said. ""For far too long, these women who are really victims of exploitation were prosecuted themselves. That has stopped, and the focus is now on those who are buying commercial sex.""

Years after her ordeal, Meston has finally found peace. She now owns Karma, a fair trade gift store in Newton that features gifts made in her home country. Meston wonders how no one noticed what was happening to her. After all, she attended school and went to the minister's church. She even cleaned the church every day.

""How could no one ask, no one went over — 'Are you OK?'"" Meston said. ""Why does this man on this farm keep bringing in these little girls?""

""It's hard for us to accept we are part of the equation,"" she added.",http://www.nbcboston.com/investigations/Hidden-in-Plain-Sight-Massage-Parlors-Selling-Sex-RubMaps-Massachusetts-509621481.html,2019-05-08T09:33:29Z,NBC10 Boston,"n, 3534 W Touhy Ave, Skokie, IL 60076, USA"
"DNA and family tree used to solve cold case rape, murder of 20-year-old woman","Advertisement DNA and family tree used to solve cold case rape, murder of 20-year-old woman Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Seattle police said Tuesday they have solved a murder from nearly 52 years ago with the help of DNA and a family tree — a method that has revolutionized cold-case investigations across the U.S. in the past year.Susan Galvin was a 20-year-old records clerk for the department in July 1967 when she was found raped and strangled in a parking garage elevator at Seattle Center. Dozens of people were questioned, and one potential suspect — a professional clown who had been seen with her a few days earlier, and who quit his job just a few days later — was never charged for lack of evidence. The clown, located in Utah in 2016, was finally cleared by a DNA test. Last summer, Seattle police provided the killer’s DNA to Parabon NanoLabs in Reston, Virginia. CeCe Moore, a Parabon genealogist who is known for her work on the public television series “Finding Your Roots,” used the public genealogy database GEDmatch to create a family tree for the killer and ultimately identified a potential suspect as Frank Wypych, a married Seattle man and former soldier who died of complications from diabetes in 1987.Seattle police exhumed his remains from a cemetery earlier this year to collect DNA and confirmed it matched that extracted from Galvin’s clothing in 2002. Investigators are now looking into whether he may have killed anyone else while stationed in New York, Alaska and Germany while in the Army.“It’s the oldest case where genetic genealogy has helped to identify the suspect,” Moore said Tuesday. “It’s amazing the DNA was still viable. The original investigators who collected the crime scene evidence did such a great job, long before they could even have imagined what could be done with DNA.”Public genealogy databases, which contain information from people who have obtained their DNA profiles from companies like 23andMe and Ancestry.com, have become a powerful police tool in the past year, since investigators in California revealed that they used the method to identify and arrest Golden State Killer suspect Joseph DeAngelo. DeAngelo, a former police officer, is accused of having murdered at least a dozen people and raped 50 in the 1970s and ’80s.More than 60 cases have been solved with genetic genealogy since then, including five in Washington state — three in the past month. At least two other cases have been solved just this week: San Diego police announced Monday that the FBI’s forensic genetic genealogy team helped them identify and arrest a serial rapist whose crimes date back to 1994, and police in Terre Haute, Indiana, said they solved the killing of a 19-year-old woman on the campus of Indiana State University in 1972. Like Wypych, that suspect is long dead; he was shot by a deputy who saw him trying to abduct a woman in 1978.Privacy advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have expressed concern over the use of public DNA databases in police investigations. They argue that by posting DNA profiles to public sites, people are also posting information about close and even distant relatives, with potentially serious implications for privacy rights.Moore said when she ran the suspect’s DNA, she came up with two distant cousins — people who shared less than about 2% of the killer’s DNA — and a handful of people who were even more scarcely related. She saw surname patterns suggesting Polish ancestry, and the suspect’s DNA profile was predicted to be about 16% Native American.She worked her way backward using those clues, and eventually found a couple — a man born in 1828 in Kentucky and a woman born Missouri in 1837 — from whom both of the distant cousins were descended. She then followed the generations forward from that ancestral couple, and found Frank Wypych, who was born in Seattle and would have been 26 at the time of the killing.Galvin had left her childhood home in Spokane a year before she was killed, according to a statement from one of her brothers, Lorimer “Larry” Galvin, who now lives in Florida. He thanked Detective Rolf Norton, who began reinvestigating the case in 2016.“52 years later we learn the who, but still have no clear understanding as to the why,” Galvin wrote. “There will always be that lingering question.Wypych was married and the father of a young child, with a second child born two years later, police said. He and his wife divorced in 1971, and he was convicted of larceny that year — his only criminal conviction. He served nine months in jail and was arrested for a weapons offense in Seattle in 1975.The department said it no longer had records of that offense, but relatives told investigators he had been impersonating a police officer and making traffic stops in uniform, armed with a gun. Wypych’s children cooperated with the investigation, though they were stunned to learn about the killing, Norton said.Norton said none of the original detectives on the case remain alive.“It’s really a credit to everyone involved back then,” Norton said. “They processed that case like it was 2015.”",https://www.wcvb.com/article/dna-and-family-tree-used-to-solve-cold-case-rape-murder-of-20-year-old-woman/27401374,2019-05-08T09:26:00Z,WCVB-TV,"5 Tv Pl, Needham, MA 02494, USA"
Mother of accused cop killer says son was troubled; Officer mourned,"BILOXI, Miss. — Residents in a Mississippi Gulf Coast city continued on Tuesday to mourn the death of a longtime officer who authorities said was gunned down by a man whose mental health had, according to his mother, been sliding in recent months.

A local NAACP leader said the man had threatened to shoot his goddaughter in 2018 when both were high school students.

A public memorial service was held Tuesday evening for Biloxi Patrolman Robert McKeithen, who was shot to death in the parking lot outside the city's police station Sunday night. Darian Tawan Atkinson, 19, is jailed without bail on capital murder charges. McKeithen, a Biloxi officer for 23 years, was shot multiple times. It remains unclear whether the 58-year-old was targeted or shot at random.

Gulfport Police spokesman Lt. Joshua Bromen said search warrants were being served Tuesday. He declined to say whether a gun had been found.

Atkinson's mother, Pamela Broger, told The Associated Press that if her son shot McKeithen, it was because of mental health problems Broger said had developed in recent months.

""Darian went to Texas to work in August,"" Broger said. ""He came back two months later and he was a completely different person. I don't know if something happened there because he wouldn't talk to me. I don't know if it was drugs.""

Broger said she had called police officers for assistance, but said officers told her they couldn't do anything because Atkinson wasn't hurting anyone.

""I'm not saying he didn't do it,"" Broger said. ""But if he did, it was because he was suffering.""

She also denied that her older son, Davian Atkinson, had done anything to merit being arrested. The 21-year-old was booked into the Harrison County jail early Tuesday on an accessory charge alleging he aided his brother.

Broger said Darian Atkinson came home Sunday night when the family didn't know about the shooting, and left Monday in Davian Atkinson's car. Bromen said ""obviously something more is involved"" in the brother's charge, noting the mother wasn't charged.

Others see Darian differently than his mother. Biloxi NAACP chapter President James Crowell told the Sun Herald that Darian Atkinson threatened his goddaughter in February 2018 when the two were Biloxi High School students discussing the shooting at Florida's Parkland High School.

""He said, 'I'm thinking about doing the same thing here and I'm going to start with you,' "" Crowell said Tuesday.

He said that his goddaughter's family reported the threat to Biloxi High School, but nothing happened until they demanded an investigation. Crowell held a news conference at the time, saying parents should have been notified. WXXV-TV reported then that the accused student, never named publicly, was suspended for three days.

""Even back then, he was threatening people,"" Crowell said Tuesday. ""I guess he went ahead and did it this time rather than just talk about it.""

Spokeswoman Jennifer Pyron said privacy laws prevent release of student records. Gulfport Police Chief Leonard Papania, who's leading the investigation, didn't respond to a text from the AP.

At the police station where McKeithen was killed, mourners continued to deposit tributes on his police SUV, overflowing onto tables the city set up.

Patricia Underwood said she drove from Gulfport to pay her respects to a man who convinced her goddaughter to remain in high school. She said her goddaughter called her in tears Monday night.

""She just cried and cried,"" Underwood said. She said her goddaughter was working at a Biloxi Waffle House two years ago and told McKeithen, a regular at the restaurant, that she was thinking of dropping out.

""He told her she didn't need to get out of school; she needed to stay in and walk across that stage and graduate. And she did,"" Underwood said.

She was joined by Linda Virgil, who retired from a Dillard's department store where McKeithen did off-duty work as a security guard.

""He would stay later to walk us to our cars every night,"" she said.

She said he loved to talk about his wife and the diamond rings he bought her, and about his children. ""He helped everybody,"" Virgil said.

Biloxi Police Capt. Milton Houseman said he was one of the officers who brought in Atkinson. Asked if he had any idea why Atkinson smiled as he was brought into the police department after his arrest 40 miles (65 kilometers) away in Wiggins, Houseman said, ""I wouldn't venture a guess as to what was in his mind.""

Atkinson's first appearance in court could come as early as Wednesday, when a judge will consider bail and could appoint a lawyer. His brother Davian Atkinson is held on $500,000 bail.

State criminal records show no felony convictions for either Atkinson brother. Davian Atkinson was cited for speeding and other traffic offenses once in 2016 and once in 2017.

Amy reported from Jackson, Mississippi.

"GA couple arrested in multi-state sting, accused of owning 40K child porn images","JEFFERSON, Ga. (WSB) - A Georgia couple is facing child pornography charges after police arrested them in a multi-state sting.

Police say they found an estimated 40,000 child porn images on hundreds of discs and electronics found in the home of Doug and Carol Chellaw.

When police arrived at their front door, they say Doug Chellaw was in plain sight.

“He was just inside the door. Sitting at his computer. Downloading pornography and on two cell phones, in a chat room with girls we believe were pre-teenaged,” said Jefferson Police Chief Tom Wirthman.

Carol Chellaw, a recently hired and now fired Jackson County Sheriff's Clerk was in the backyard gardening.

The pair are among the 82 people, including 31 in Georgia, who have been arrested and accused of sexually exploiting children in a multi-state sting.

Dubbed Operation Southern Impact III, the sting was spread over three days across 8 southern states from Florida to West Virginia. It enlisted the work of 200 law enforcement agencies.

Since Carol Chellaw has bonded out, WSB went by her home to try and talk with her about the case.

No one answered.

Police say she claims she knew nothing about what was going on.

“That’s what she said,” said Wirthman, adding, “And then upon further questioning, later on that evening, she asked for a lawyer.""

Investigators are still going through all of the evidence collected during the sting. They rescued 17 children during the operation from multiple states.

Closer to home, a Metter man, 39-year-old Timothy Wayne Diggs, was arrested in the operation on charges of sexual exploitation and possession of marijuana. According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, he is an information technology specialist.",http://www.wsav.com/news/local-news/georgia-news/ga-couple-arrested-in-multi-state-sting-accused-of-owning-40k-child-porn-images/1987335167,2019-05-07T23:41:35Z,WSAV,"1430 E Victory Dr, Savannah, GA 31404, USA"

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - Chick-fil-A is a restaurant on a roll.

It's a restaurant that has enjoyed unprecedented growth as well as huge revenues - and they're even closed on Sundays.

Gus Mir, a Tampa Bay area man who's been there from the beginning, goes On the Bench With Benson this week to discuss the quirks, secrets and controversy around one of the hottest fast food chains going.

You can watch their full interview above.

Josh: Hey Gus, thanks for being here.

Gus: My pleasure.

Josh: Have a seat.

Gus: Thank you.

Josh: Did you ever envision that you'd dedicate your life around the chicken?

Gus: I was attracted to Chick-fil-A because I was 15 years old and I wanted a job. So I started working for Doris Williams in 1981.

Josh: So she opened the very first Chick-fil-A?

Gus: She opened the very first mall restaurant in 1967.

Josh: So she knew what she was doing?

Gus: She sure did.

Josh: Tell us what you do for Chick-fil-A.

Gus: Well, I'm a restaurant operator, I have two individual franchises in Pinellas County.

Josh: Is Chick-fil-A downright owning the fast food industry right now?

Gus: Well, we've experienced really unprecedented growth for our company. The cornerstones are just a great restaurant experience, great quality, served by great people.

Josh: When you see people wrapped around the building and for someone who's never been there, they think, ""Naw, I'm not going to wait."" But you can get them through pretty quickly.

Gus: We do. And think about it, we're serving about 140 guests in the drive-thru in one of our peak hours. That's a car at the window every 24 seconds. Somewhere in there.

Josh: I read a stat that you use more lemons than the country of Japan.

Gus: Our freshly squeezed lemonade is one of our cornerstone menu items.

Josh: But that takes a lot of time.

Gus: It takes a lot of time, every lemon is freshly squeezed in the restaurant.

Josh: When I pull up, I see a really happy person, a very polite person. They have the food ready. It's rarely wrong, if ever. What's the secret there?

Gus: We select enthusiastic people. People that love other people and serving guests. And we see some of the faces literally three to five times per week.

Josh: The franchise, I heard, it's not that expensive - is that true?

Gus: It's not that expensive. It's a franchise fee upfront, it doesn't take a lot of working capital but it does take active involvement in the business.

Josh: But it's competitive.

Gus: It's very competitive. Sometimes it's harder to get into the C.F.A. (Chick-fil-A), then the C.I.A. because of their selection standards.

Josh: What has it done to allow you to tap into the community?

Gus: It's really given us a foundation where we are able to take good care of people in the community. We rallied 400 team members at the USF Sun Dome last fall and assembled 167,000 meals for Feeding Children Everywhere.

Josh: There has been a little bit of controversy I wanted to ask you about, alleged funding for anti-LGTBQ organizations. Surely you must be asked about that.

Gus: Josh, I would tell you that a simple question that you asked deserves a simple answer. And that is we're a restaurant company that's focused on great food, served by great people in a warm and welcoming environment for everyone. That's my simple answer.

Josh: What is the hardest party of running your franchises right now?

Gus: The hardest part is keeping and retaining great people.

Josh: Well thanks so much for being with us, Gus.

Gus: Thank you.

Josh: Appreciate it, have a great day.

Derrick Thompson given life without parole for murder of Allen Johnson,"PANAMA CITY — Derrick Thompson on Tuesday was sentenced to life without parole for the 2014 murder of Allen Johnson, avoiding the death penalty.

A jury reached the verdict after almost four hours of deliberation. Jurors had the choice of life without parole or the death penalty. Family members and friends of Johnson, who were in the court audience, cried when hearing Thompson would get life instead of death.

“I have never seen remorse from (Thompson),” Kim Limmer, a relative of Johnson, said after the verdict was read. “I can’t sleep at night. I have to go to a grave to talk to him. He gets to see his mother. She still gets to see him.”

Thompson was found guilty Friday of first-degree murder and robbery with a firearm for the killing of Johnson, a friend. Thompson shot Johnson twice to get money to fund an addiction to prescription pills.

Prosecutor Larry Basford hugged Limmer and talked to the family and friends after the verdict. Johnson’s loved ones thanked Basford for his efforts and Basford said law enforcement investigators did a good job with the case.

“We appreciate y’all being patient. It’s not the verdict we wanted but the jury worked very hard. It wasn’t easy,” Basford said. “Allen was a good man. He was a good man to everyone who knew him.”

During the defense’s opening statement, attorney Kimberly Jewell said jurors were being asked to make one of the biggest decisions they ever will make.

“Will you agree with me a man’s life is worth more than his worst moments?” Jewell said to the jury.

The defense emphasized Thompson’s religious beliefs and how he could use that to help other inmates.

Thompson previously was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder in Santa Rosa County for the separate murders of Milton residents Steven Zackowski, 60, and Debra Zackowski, 59, shortly before Johnson was killed. Thompson also was sentenced to life without parole in that case.

The trial for Johnson’s murder is the first death penalty case to go to trial in Bay County since the revamping of capital punishment in Florida. The 12-person jury needed to unanimously return a verdict in favor of the death penalty for the sentence to be imposed.

The trial lasted seven days, not including the weekend. Jury selection lasted three days from April 29 to May 1. Opening statements were made May 1 after the jury was picked, and the penalty phase began Monday.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190507/derrick-thompson-given-life-without-parole-for-murder-of-allen-johnson?rssfeed=true,2019-05-07T18:37:38Z,Panama City News Herald,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA"
"Former Cape Coral resident now leading the ATF, first woman to head the agency","Regina ""Reggie"" Lombardo was sworn-in as the Acting Deputy Director of the agency on Wednesday, replacing retiring Deputy Director Thomas Brandon. (Photo: Special to The News-Press)

The new Acting Deputy Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — the first woman to head the federal agency — has her heart in Southwest Florida despite leading an agency based in Washington, D.C.

Regina Lombardo, 56 and known to everyone as ""Reggie"", looks fondly on her days in Fort Myers and Cape Coral when she worked in her parent's deli, was competitive in high school sports and even modeled hairstyles for a top local stylist.

""It's been a ride,"" she said Tuesday, adding that the first female acting director aspect ""feels really profound.""

Reggie Lombardo said being the first female was never at the forefront of why she was at ATF.

""Its an agency that regulates gun laws,"" she said, and not really a place a lot of women generally think of or naturally gravitate to.

""I hope to change that,"" she said. ""I feel humble and proud. I hope to be a role model. You can't be what you can't see.""

Attorney General William P. Barr announced Lombardo's appointment April 24 and she was sworn-in as head of the agency on Wednesday, replacing retiring Deputy Director Thomas Brandon.

In a statement, Barr said Lombardo has proven herself to be an outstanding leader.

""She is well qualified to continue ATF's successes of recent years, including helping the Department investigate and prosecute more firearms offenders than ever before,"" he said.

Lombardo, speaking from ATF headquarters in Washington, D.C., said her heart is usually split between Southwest Florida and New York, where her family originally settled.

""I still fight with that,"" she said. ""I go back to where my family is, where my heart is. When I go back to Fort Myers it makes me feel peaceful. It still feels like home.""

Still, she loves her New York travels.

She also considers her path to the ATF a bit unorthodox, going from a family that had a legitimate liquor business to an agency that targets illicit liquor activities.

The Lombardos have roots that go deep into New York's past — she said one part of the family has the second liquor license issued there — and they operated a wine and liquor business in East Harlem in the 1920s.

""We took out what we knew and brought it to Fort Myers,"" she said.

Her promotion to the top of the ATF came as no surprise to her mom Milly Lombardo, 86, and older sister Rosemarie Lombardo, 63, both of whom still live in Southwest Florida.

""Mom is excited, and proud ... and worried,"" Rosemarie Lombardo said. She then added with a chuckle: ""She's not worried about the criminals, she's worried about Washington D.C.""

Rosemarie Lombardo, oldest of the four Lombardo children, said her little sister was no ballerina type growing up.

""She was rough and tumble,"" she said. ""She was a very hard worker and determined. But she was friendly and sociable too.""

Rosemarie Lombardo said her sister worked at the family business in Cape Coral, Lombardo's Italian Deli and Bakery, which was actually started in New York by their grandparents.

Actually, Reggie Lombardo said, the deli here first opened as an Italian food shop in Fort Myers on U.S. 41 and moved to the larger deli location in Cape Coral in 1979. Her parents closed it at the end of 2000.

""I don't think work (at the deli) was her first passion,"" Rosemarie said. ""It was always there, it wasn't punishment. It was very lighthearted.""

Rosemarie Lombardo said her sister did well working at the deli and was good with the customers and later helped her in a pasta-making enterprise.

That restaurant experience obviously stayed with her, her sister said. ""She is an avid cook,"" she said. ""She knows her food.""

Reggie Lombardo readily agreed.

""One of my passions is to cook,"" she said. ""That's where my creative side comes out.""

Her sister said Reggie Lombardo, along with her brother, Raphael, were also interested in dancing and would serve as hair style models when top local stylist Valentino did hair shows.

""We competed in disco and danced at the Edison pageant,"" Reggie Lombardo said.

Just a year apart in age from her brother, his death in 1996 devastated her.

""It was the greatest heartbreak of my life,"" she said.

Carolyn Rogers of Fort Myers said she and Lombardo went to school together, graduating from Bishop Verot High School in Fort Myers in 1981. She said that Reggie Lombardo was class president one year and was always a leader and a hard worker.

""My heart is full of pride for her today,"" Rogers said.

She remembers when the Lombardos moved to Cape Coral in the 1970s when the new ATF head was in fourth grade and the city was still fairly unpopulated.

""There was no more than 10,000 people living there ... in the early 70s,"" Rogers said.

She said growing up in New York gave Lombardo ""street smarts"" and likely helped her as she rose through the ATF ranks.

Rogers remembered Lombardo working at the family business for a number of years.

""She’s beautiful, kind and amazing,"" she said. ""And quite an athlete in her day.""

Rosemarie Lombardo agreed with Rogers' assessment.

""Sports was her passion,"" she said. ""She was an avid softball player. I think she even played on one of the boys' teams.""

That sports activity helped her as she went to college assisted by a softball scholarship.

She figured out her future in college segueing from education to law and then to law enforcement.

""Not a lot of women wanted to work on bombs and explosives,"" she said. ""It was more of a challenge. That's what triggered me to focus.""

The new director is close to the mandatory retirement age for federal agency workers, 57, but an extension isn't outside the realm of possibilities.

""Whatever role they want me to play,"" she said. ""I am willing, no discussions.""

Man with violent history tries to run from deputies,"PENSACOLA, Fla. (WKRG) -- Escambia County sheriff's deputies arrested a man Sunday who had two active warrants for battery, child abuse and vehicle theft.

Deputies were called to an ""unknown problem"" and got out of car and saw Nico Carter, 35, walking away from them and they tried to stop him. They chased him down yelling ""stop."" He jumped a fence and other deputies caught him a few minutes later, according to the arrest report.

In the meantime, the responding deputy was interviewing a woman who said Carter seemed to be on drugs and was ""paranoid"" talking about people trying to kill him. She said Carter was opening and closing a pocket knife. She told the deputy she was in fear that he would cut her with the knife.

Carter had two active warrants. He was wanted for an incident February 4 where a friend of Carter's told deputies he tried to steal her car. She poked holes in two of the tires so he couldn't leave then she locked herself in the house. She then opened the door so they could talk but he punched her with a closed fist in the back of her head. She said she then locked the door and he broke the windows out of her other car, according to the report.

She said Carter got into her Chrysler and rammed her Hyundai causing about $7,000 in damage before leaving in the Chrysler.

Carter was also wanted for punching a woman repeatedly and shoving a child against a wall on December 24, 2018.

PCSO: Medical emergency appears to lead to semi-driver's death in Polk County,"He almost struck a school bus before veering off road into ditch.

Authorities say that it appears a Florida man driving a semi in Polk County suffered some sort of medical emergency while driving in Farley Township on May 3, and he died after the semi almost struck a school bus and veered off the road.

Texas firefighters finish pouring concrete for man who had medical emergency,"CARROLLTON, Texas – Off-duty firefighters went above and beyond their calling for a patient having a medical emergency when they went to his home on their day off to finish a project he had started.

According to a Facebook post, a man had a medical emergency while pouring concrete around his home. Rescue crews from the Carrollton Fire Department quickly responded and brought him to a hospital.

Concerned his concrete and hard work would go to waste if left unattended, the first responders called off-duty firefighters to finish the job for him. One even brought his own tools to help with the work.

DUI charges for man who crashed into cruiser – on tractor,"- Police in Haines City say a 68-year-old man -- whose license has been suspended for 41 years -- was drunk when he drove his lawn tractor into a police cruiser Saturday evening.

According to police, the HCPD vehicle was parked at Rodriguez Fashion along U.S. Highway 17/92. Around 7 p.m., the officer heard a loud noise and walked outside to find Gary Wayne Anderson aboard a mower and noticed “minor damage” to the plastic portion of the police vehicle’s rear bumper.

Anderson, 68, allegedly admitted that he hit the vehicle and that he was drunk, though he denied causing any damage. Police say his demeanor ranged from laughing to aggressive as he failed to complete the field sobriety tests, so they took him into custody.

At the police station, he claimed that he had been poisoned by police and asked to be taken to a hospital. Officers complied and took him to Heart of Florida Regional Medical Center, where his blood-alcohol content was measured at .241 – more than three times the legal limit.

Police say there was also cocaine in Anderson’s system. When they confronted him about it, he allegedly accused the officers of giving it to him and responded with foul language and racial slurs.

According to officers, Anderson’s driver’s license has been suspended since March of 1978. He has two prior DUI convictions and now faces new misdemeanor charges of DUI and refusal to submit to a DUI test.

Anderson’s lawn mower and its attached trailer were towed, police noted.

“I’m proud of the professional demeanor our officers showed when dealing with this heavily-intoxicated, belligerent offender,” Chief Jim Elensky said. “It’s never a good idea to get behind the wheel drunk, even if that wheel is to a Craftsman, Massey Ferguson or John Deere.”",http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/dui-charges-for-man-who-crashed-into-cruiser-on-tractor,2019-05-06T15:01:55Z,FOX 13 NEWS,"3213 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33609, USA"

Florida Man Fires Gun at Teens Enjoying Community Pool,"Photo: Volusia County Jail

Last week (April 23) Ormond Beach police arrested 66-year-old Richard Marcelle , a Board member of The Village community HOA, after he fired a gun to threaten three teens at community pool

A report was filed by one of the victims’ mothers, a homeowner in The Village. According to the filed report, her son, Julian Johnson, is 18 years old, a resident of the subdivision, and is therefore legally allowed to be at the pool, as well as accompany minors at the pool. Julian and two friends (one of them a minor) went to the pool around 9 p.m., and were confronted by Marcelle while swimming.

According to the narrative posted by News Daytona Beach, Marcelle approached the teens and demanded they leave the pool stating the communal area closed at sunset. The trio peacefully agreed to leave, as they didn’t intend to violate any rules; but as they gathered their belongings one noticed that the posted pool rules showed the area closed at 10 p.m., not “sunset” as Marcelle claimed. After seeing the official posted sign, they approached Marcelle at the front of the pool’s clubhouse and informed him of his error.

Marcelle told them the rules changed and they needed to leave.

It wasn’t a clear case of the audacity of Caucasity, at least not yet; Marcelle wasn’t entirely wrong at this point. Later investigation showed that the HOA board had in fact voted to change the pool’s closing hours just a few days prior to the incident. But, the posted rules had not changed yet, meaning residents were not properly informed and, arguably, the rule did not yet stand as officially instated.

A small verbal argument then ensued between the victims and Marcelle. Ultimately, the three teens decided to follow the posted official signs, and keep enjoying their pool time.

This is where Richard Marcelle went totally off-the-rails wrong:

Rather than reason with the teens, or return with the HOA meeting minutes that showed the vote to close the pool at sunset…Marcelle stormed back to the pool area with “a small black revolver style handgun”. He then took that gun, recklessly, and fired a shot into the soil off to the side of where the three teens were.

“Did you really just shoot a gun?” one teen asked according to the report, to which Marcelle replied “yes, I am putting my own life at risk.”

Oh, the audacity.

The victims fled, likely in immense fear, as Marcelle followed them to their car. After quickly writing down Marcelle’s tag number off of his vehicle, the teens left the area and ultimately told their parents who helped them file police reports.

Once police began investigating and reviewing security footage, Marcelle’s behavior is shown as even more bizarre. For instance, police claim Marcelle initially rolled up to the pool clubhouse “in a truck with no vehicle lights on, in what appeared to be an attempt to not be noticed”. And despite Marcelle claiming it was he himself who was putting his own life at risk, police noted he’s “seen on video maintaining an aggressive stance while standing in front of the victims,” loaded gun in hand. It was also noted by police that “the victims made no aggressive or violent advancements, postures or gestures towards Marcelle” seen on camera.

Reports haven’t released the race of the teens involved…but we can probably take an educated guess. Regardless of race, no one should have to face the barrel of a loaded gun for simply swimming.

Marcelle was booked into the Volusia County Jail on May 1, charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and discharging a firearm in public. Jail records show he posted $35,000 bond and is no longer in custody.

Wanted Florida man hoped blonde wig would disguise him from deputies as he biked away,"Moral of the story from sheriff's office: Above all else DO NOT wear a hideous wig while trying to run from the Po/Po on a bicycle.

A Florida fugitive wanted on drug charges tried to elude deputies surrounding the home he was in Thursday by donning a long blonde wig and riding off on a bicycle, the Brevard County Sheriff's Office said.

The wig didn't work, and agents caught up with and arrested Robert “Bobby” Walls soon after watching him ride away, deputies said.

Walls later admitted he put the wig on in hopes that officers wouldn't recognize him and that he'd avoid arrest, deputies said.

Investigators had set up a perimeter around the residence after getting a tip he was there. Walls' warrant was one of over 100 in ""a significant drug investigation"" by the sheriff's office.

Walls was charged with conspiracy to possess controlled substance, solicitation to sell controlled substance, and unlawful use of a two-way device.

So here is the moral of the story,"" the sheriff's office posted on its Facebook page.

"St. Lucie County sheriff's captain to be memorialized in Washington, D.C., before thousands of people","Almost 30 years ago, Charlie Scavuzzo was a Fort Pierce police officer when his best friend and fellow officer Danny Parrish got shot and killed in the line of duty.

Scavuzzo went to Washington, D.C., when Parrish’s name was added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, the country’s monument to officers who die in the line of duty.

“When they put Danny on the wall in Washington, Charlie went and he always talked about it and what a huge deal it was and how awesome and amazing it was,” said Scavuzzo’s widow, Tonya Scavuzzo.

Charlie Scavuzzo, 49, died in September 2017 when he was a captain with the St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office. His name is joining Parrish's on the wall.

He is one of 371 names added this year, and the only one from the Treasure Coast.

A candlelight vigil is scheduled Monday night on the National Mall. The names will be read. It's an event St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara expects 10,000 to 12,000 people will attend. A memorial at the U.S. Capitol is planned for Wednesday.

“It’s going to be hard. I think it’s going to be super emotional, but I can’t think of any better way than this for Charlie to be remembered on this kind of scale,” Tonya Scavuzzo said. “It’s a tremendous honor and he absolutely deserves it.”

Charlie Scavuzzo, who spent more than a decade as a narcotics investigator, died of a heart attack after a particularly difficult period on the job.

From 2009 through 2018, the top three causes of law enforcement officer deaths are gunshots, job-related illnesses and automobile crashes, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.

‘No matter what it took’

Sheriff’s Chief Deputy Garry Wilson said Scavuzzo worked around the clock in the days before his death, helping prepare for Hurricane Irma, and immersing himself in a homicide investigation.

Mascara and Tonya Scavuzzo, 49, said his work ethic was typical.

“He was going to finish the job no matter what it took,” Mascara said. “If it took working day and night for three or four days that’s what he always did. That’s just the kind of guy he was.”

Mascara remembered that on the day Scavuzzo died, he ran into him at a Dunkin’ Donuts. Mascara asked him how he was doing. He said Scavuzzo remarked he was exhausted, and Mascara encouraged him to sit down and relax. Scavuzzo wouldn’t have it, Mascara said, saying he had to get going because he thought he had a lead on the homicide case he was working.

Later that day he told some people in his unit he was going home because he felt exhausted and wanted to shower, freshen up and come back to work, Mascara said.

“He was coming back to work, but he never came back,” he said.

‘Poncho’

Mascara shared a story about Scavuzzo and his deep connections to the community.

Shortly after he was elected sheriff, he answered a call from a woman who wanted to remain anonymous, he said. She had important information for “Poncho.”

More: AK-47, drugs seized in St. Lucie County after deputies told about planned gang shooting, robbery

He said his secretary didn’t know Poncho, nor did Mascara. Mascara said he called the woman back and said he needed more information.

“She said, ‘You don’t know who Poncho is? Everybody in Fort Pierce knows who Poncho is. It’s Charlie Scavuzzo’,” Mascara said. “That was his street name.""

Everyone called him that and adored him and shared a tremendous amount of information with him because they knew they could trust him, Mascara said.

Charlie Scavuzzo was honored during the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office's Laying of the Wreath Service for National Law Enforcement Memorial Week on May 6 in Fort Pierce. That service honored the Sheriff's Office's eight heroes and one K9 that gave their lives while serving the community in St. Lucie County.

Mascara said he’s been to the ceremonies for three other deputies, including sheriff’s Sgt. Gary Morales, who was shot to death in a traffic stop in 2013 south of Edwards Road.

Charlie Scavuzzo was close with Morales, mentoring Morales while Morales was in the drug unit until he became a sergeant.

Tonya Scavuzzo said her husband didn’t attend the event in Washington when Morales’ name was added to the wall.

“He did CPR on Danny (Parrish) so when it happened to Gary I don’t think he could have went, honestly,” Tonya Scavuzzo said. “He was Gary’s boss and he thought of Gary as a son, so it was really tough on him.”

Mascara said he thought Scavuzzo may have been elected the next sheriff after Mascara retires. That, he said, is why he moved Scavuzzo to different areas in the agency so he could get experience.

Mascara said after he first was elected in 2000, he tried to speak to all sheriff’s employees to ask what was working and what needed to be changed or improved.

“One of the things that I heard quite often from the employees of the Sheriff’s Office was that Charlie Scavuzzo had to be returned back to the drug unit,” Mascara said.

Mascara said moving Scavuzzo from road patrol back to the drug unit was his first transfer.

'Deserves every bit of this’

Tonya Scavuzzo said several family members, including their three children, who range in age from 18 to 22, will be in Washington for the event.

“Being recognized locally is one thing and Charlie deserves it,"" Tonya Scavuzzo said. ""But nationally, where he’ll be there forever and everybody will know that he was a real hero, that’s what I want my kids to see.

“They already know that he was our superman, but he was more than that. He deserves every bit of this.”

The rise of the nursefluencer,"Sarah’s Instagram feed is pretty typical for a 21-year-old model-slash-influencer living in Florida. Here she is standing dreamily in front of some ferns. Over here she’s clutching Starbucks’s new Cloud Macchiato. She poses on porches, by murals, in bathrooms, often with lengthy captions that reveal what she’s up to this weekend (wedding planning, working), words of inspiration, and her very relatable love of donuts.

There’s one important difference: In all of them, she’s wearing scrubs.

Which is appropriate, considering “shesinscrubs” is her username. Along with modeling, Sarah, who asked not to reveal her last name, is a registered nurse. Over the course of just four months she has amassed an Instagram following of more than 11,000 people.

Being a nursefluencer, a term that I have admittedly made up but that describes a growing population, is similar to being a regular influencer: You get someone to take pictures (for Sarah, it’s her little brother), you post often (once a day or else the algorithm will bury you, Sarah tells me), and promote products (like almost everyone I spoke to for this piece, Sarah receives free scrubs from the brand Figs).

On the other hand, regular influencers don’t usually have to worry about whether promoting, say, CBD oil violates medical ethics. HIPAA, the law that protects patient privacy and medical records, is also presumably not a high-priority consideration.

But for Sarah, and many young health care professionals like her, a sizeable Instagram following is a salve for a litany of problems experienced by those in the field: burnout, odd hours, and a lack of a creative outlet, to start. So it’s not surprising that within the past few months, tons of accounts like hers have popped up, gaining huge followings — largely made up of fellow medical professionals — by posting an insider’s view of the industry.

It’s also raised questions about the ethics of being a health care influencer. After all, isn’t the only person who should be influencing anyone’s health their own doctor?

Where did medical influencers come from?

Instagram is a place where you are supposed to show off how “well” you’re doing, even if you’re not doing very well at all. Scroll through the feed and you’re likely to see signifiers of social wellness (friends), mental wellness (books and bathtubs), and physical wellness (yoga and photogenic health foods) that might bear negligible resemblance to one’s actual life.

Those who have succeeded at performing that wellness the most palatably for the platform have been rewarded with millions of followers, which in turn can bring brand deals and, with that, money. It’s created a new class of microcelebrities who, intentionally or not, wield enormous influence over how others live their lives, or at least how they present their lives on social media.

“I see people all the time advertise things like, ‘My specialty is cosmetic dentistry. There is no specialty of cosmetic dentistry. It’s not a recognized dental subspecialty.”

While most of the time when we think of wellness influencers, we might think of acro-yoga couples or, on the extreme end, people like Freelee the Banana Girl, the nude vegan vlogger who lives in a South American jungle and eats exclusively fruit, there are some accounts that are actively harmful: Instagram has contended with a serious anti-vaccine conspiracy theory problem, for instance. Its algorithmic recommendation engine can also conflate many types of “health” content, so that following one anti-vaccination account might push you to follow dozens of others, but could also group them alongside accounts promoting innocuous things like plant-based diets.

Health care influencers who have flooded the site within the past few years say they’re fighting back against that kind of social media misinformation. Many nurses and doctors on Instagram combine the cute, aspirational lifestyle aesthetic of regular fashion and beauty influencers with actual medical tips from a vetted professional.

There are now so many medical professionals on Instagram that at least one hospital has created an entire position to govern it. Austin Chiang, MD, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at Jefferson Health in Philadelphia, also holds the position of chief medical social media officer, which he guesses might be the first of its kind in the country. “I always felt strongly that we need a stronger clinician presence on social media in order to really battle misinformation out there,” he says.

It’s why last fall, he and a few peers launched the hashtag campaign #VerifyHealthcare, which encouraged health care professionals on social media to list their qualifications, such as their education, specializations, and board certifications. “A lot of us had started noticing health professionals who were saying that they were some sort of practitioner when they actually were not,” he says. “If they’re talking about health and marketing themselves as doctors, then the public could be misled.”

Many of the top Instagram posts related to plastic surgery, for instance, are from doctors not specially trained in plastic surgery despite the fact that they’ve marketed themselves as “cosmetic surgeons.” Naturopaths, chiropractors, and aestheticians are also typically not medical doctors, but some may present themselves on social media as such.

Concerns like these have been top of mind for people like Arthur L. Caplan, the founding director of NYU’s Division of Medical Ethics. “I see people all the time advertise things like, ‘My specialty is cosmetic dentistry.’” he says. “There is no specialty of cosmetic dentistry. It’s not a recognized dental subspecialty.”

On Instagram, health care isn’t just a day job anymore, it’s a personal brand, and an increasingly lucrative one at that: All the health care influencers I spoke to had seen their followings skyrocket in the past year, which some hope will lead to bigger brand deals.

But wait, why do doctors need side hustles?

Dentist Joyce Kahng has more than 13,000 followers on the account she launched just a year ago, @joycethedentist. When she first started, she posted up-close images of teeth (she used her family members’ due to HIPAA concerns) because that’s what she saw other dentists doing. But, she said, laughing, “those weren’t being received well by normal people.”

Instead, the content that performs best on the page now is about her life as a dentist in addition to owning her own practice and being a professor at USC. Being likable and accessible, she says, has also translated into business: Around three-quarters of her new patients have found her via Instagram. “It gives you a competitive edge against the already saturated dental market,” she explains.

Despite health care being a relatively stable and high-paying industry, Kahng sees her growing Instagram following as an investment. “In some future, I do want to start to monetize it because at some point I need to have kids,” she says. “I just haven’t figured out the way in which to do it that doesn’t make me feel like a sellout.”

This is when I ask her the very obvious question: If an extremely successful dentist, business owner, and professor is worried about not being able to afford children, what hope do the rest of us have?

“Dentistry does pay well,” she explains. “The thing is, you have to work in order to be paid. It’s not like a corporate job where you can call in sick. If I don’t come in, every single person that I employ cannot work that day. I just imagine being pregnant and having to miss work for a month, [and] the office cannot run. That concerns me.”

It’s not as if health care professionals haven’t always had side hustles. The internet is filled with tips on how to make extra money as a nurse — RNs can make, on average, from $50,000 to nearly $100,000 depending on the state where they live, but when adjusted for cost of living, that number can be lower. It’s also a job that has a high rate of burnout due to the stressful work environment and difficult working conditions, which means that not everyone can or wants to make it a lifelong career.

Many nurses have recently turned to multilevel marketing as a way to supplement their incomes or as a path out of the field. And though none of the influencers I spoke to were making serious (if any) money on Instagram, most acknowledged the possibility of doing so in the future.

“I don’t think it’s fair to be like, ‘You’re a nurse, you care for other people, therefore you’re not allowed to benefit yourself financially,’” says Katy B (who also asked to keep her last name private), a registered nurse in San Francisco with more than 25,000 followers. “Most of us have a lot of student debt and trying to stay afloat. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it as long as you’re being transparent about what you’re doing.”

Spon con, HIPAA, and medical advice: the ethics of being an Instagram doctor

That transparency, of course, comes hand in hand with the question of sponcon, or sponsored content. For the average influencer, it’s pretty simple: A brand pays them a sum of money to endorse a product, like laxative teas or viral YouTube toys, in a way that leverages their large following.

It’s different, though, when you’re also leveraging your expertise and reputation as a doctor, dentist, or nurse. Scroll through most health care influencers’ Instagram feeds and you’re likely to see at least a few #ads. Some are innocuous: Many influencers have deals with the aforementioned scrubs brand Figs, while others promote products like stethoscope charms shaped like Disney characters that can help keep nervous kids calm during checkups.

Though few peddle the kind of questionable medical treatments shilled by celebrities like Dr. Oz (rapid weight-loss pills with harmful side effects, for instance) some toe the very blurry line about what’s appropriate for a health care professional to post. Mike Varshavski, a cartoonishly handsome New York City physician who goes by the name Doctor Mike on Instagram and has more than 3 million followers, regularly posts sponsored content for everything from Clorox bleach to Quaker Oats and American Express, which could create the perception that these corporations are somehow medically approved by this doctor. (Disclosure: Doctor Mike has participated in a Vox Media panel event.)

Even average Instagram influencers now shill drugs and medical devices paid for by Big Pharma, without necessarily any real knowledge of how they work. When products fall under the health umbrella, the ethical questions are even more complicated. The Federal Trade Commission does have specific guidelines for doctor endorsements. For example, doctors should not misrepresent their specific areas of expertise. But it still raises the question: Should a doctor be paid to promote essential oils? What about NyQuil?

“I’m not sure [doctors] have any place [promoting over-the-counter products] other than to say, ‘I’m a regular user.’ I think it still undermines their professional credibility,” Caplan says. “When you start endorsing, say, aromatherapy, you’re saying you had a great time at a spa and you felt it really helped your anxiety or something. You’re getting into pseudo-medicine stuff. Some of those things can make you feel better, but you don’t want to give them scientific endorsement.”

It’s a debate that’s somewhat reminiscent of decades-long concerns about pharmaceutical companies paying or wooing doctors to prescribe their products. But this, Caplan explains, isn’t the way it works anymore. “You don’t have the old, ‘We’re gonna bring you donuts every week and you keep writing prescriptions for our drug.’”

There’s nothing in the Hippocratic oath that claims thou shalt not hashtag #ad

“It’s not that everybody suddenly became ethical,” he said, laughing. Rather, now pharmaceutical companies can market directly to the patient. “There’s the ads that are like, ‘Ask your doctor about this cancer medication.’ If you have to ask your doctor about a cancer medication, you need a new cancer doctor.”

Sponcon, however, is not the main ethical concern for most health care influencers — after all, doctors and nurses endorse products all the time; as long as they comply with FTC advertising disclosure guidelines, there’s nothing in the Hippocratic oath that claims thou shalt not hashtag #ad.

Instead, that concern is HIPAA, or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, a federal law that provides privacy and security protections for patients’ medical information. Under HIPAA, all patients have the ability to see how and where their medical records are being used and prevent them from being seen by their employer or insurance company. And unlike shilling over-the-counter drugs, violating HIPAA is a fireable offense. The problem, though, is that HIPAA existed a decade and a half before Instagram did.

“It’s not as simple as not mentioning someone’s name,” Chiang explains. “Instagram is visual, so you see a lot of procedural photos. There are certainly risks in that. There’s even risks in geo-tagging or talking about a case that you’re doing.”

Some doctors and surgeons have achieved enormous followings on social media by posting procedural videos from the gross (Sandra Lee, who goes by the nickname “Dr. Pimple Popper”) to the straight-up gory. In 2015, Dr. Michael Salzhauer, or “Dr. Miami” began posting graphic videos of himself performing butt lifts, breast surgery, and liposuction on Snapchat, which regularly garnered more than a million views.

Dr. Miami reportedly secured permission from his patients to do so. Every influencer I spoke to listed HIPAA as one of their top concerns and said they were diligent about not posting anything that might cross a line.

“You can change the date, gender, or demographic, but someone from [their] work or family could recognize the case no matter how much you change about it,” Sarah says. “I would be scared to even think about posting about any of my patients. Maybe one of them saying, ‘You were a nice nurse.’”

Instagram is offering prospective doctors and nurses a look inside their world, and a way to deal with the stress

Though weighing the ethical questions like HIPAA and sponcon can be thorny, health care influencers also provide a genuine service for those interested in joining the field.

Like Kahng, Katy started her Instagram page after seeing similar accounts, and today, the majority of her followers are fellow health care professionals or aspiring ones. Though she originally went to college with the goal of being a physician, she realized it wasn’t for her. Now she’s on track to receive her master’s in June, when she will become a pediatric primary care nurse practitioner.

“I don’t think it’s fair to be like, ‘You’re a nurse, you care for other people, therefore you’re not allowed to benefit yourself financially.’”

“My main goal is to share what my journey looks like, because in health care, especially for folks that aren’t familiar with the professional fields, there’s so many different things that you can do,” she says. “It’s cool when we all share our unique perspective of what it actually looks like on the human side.”

This explains why accounts like hers have been able to grow so quickly in such short amounts of time: There’s a real hunger among prospective medical professionals to get a sense of what the job and the lifestyle really look like.

“We’re so at risk for burnout, because we spend a lot of time taking care of other people, and I think sometimes we forget how to take care of ourselves,” she adds. “We have to brag about the cool things that we do!”

What you don’t see on Katy’s Instagram page — for reasons that are very obvious and very necessary — is her actual job. She’s currently in an emergency pediatric psychiatric care unit, where she works with children up to age 17 who are experiencing immediate psychiatric crises.

It’s difficult to imagine how the stress of such an environment can affect a person, but it does help explain why so many Instagram nurses and doctors fill their feeds with a heavily curated stream of bright and shiny images. For those who work in emergency rooms, it’s impossible to predict what the day will bring. But on Instagram, everything’s perfectly controlled.

Dustin Harris, a resident emergency room physician in Chicago, deals with the stress using humor. He’d done some standup, and started posting the funny things patients would say to Facebook. On his Instagram page, where he has nearly 18,000 followers, he posts jokes, memes, and sometimes even haikus relating to the job.

“My favorite part about it is making people laugh. It keeps me balanced. I’ll be working and I’ll see some disease, and be like, ‘Oh man, I could write a funny rap about this.’ The human body is a funny thing sometimes.”

“TV has portrayed medicine as being very dramatic or sexy,” he adds. “I felt that I could show the more real version of it. Not that those things that happen don’t ever happen, like awesome procedures or people coming back to life, but that’s not every day.”

Making light of the often dark professional realities of health care is how Sarah, the nurse in Florida, built her following in the first place. She’d started the meme account @scrublifenurses last June, which then gave her the skills and platform to launch her own personal page. Memes there range from the silly (a video of a possum carrying her babies captioned with “When you’re the only seasoned nurse on the floor with a bunch of new grads”) to the serious (the phrase “A national effort for safe staffing ratios for nurses” combined with the viral clip of Mo’nique saying “I would like to see it.”).

“A lot of our job is dealing with human emotion, and you can bring that home pretty easily,” Sarah says. “If you just bottle it all up and you already have issues with your own mental health, it can be extremely detrimental and then you lose your love for your passion.”

On both her meme account and her personal page, Sarah often posts about topics like mental health, the importance of nurses’ unions, and other national health care issues. That, of course, in addition to the stylized photos typical of influencers. “I like to post [photos that show] this isn’t what it really is, but at the same time have an aesthetically pleasing feed. It’s kind of like you have control over something, but when you’re at work it’s chaos.”

Nursefluencers aren’t going anywhere anytime soon

The benefits of being a health care professional with a big Instagram following — having a creative outlet, the ability to market oneself, and the sense that you’re combating misinformation on the internet, for instance — mean that the phenomenon isn’t likely going to slow down.

One problem, though, is that medical students aren’t exactly taught how to use Instagram responsibly. Caplan, the medical ethicist, says that at most they’ll get a single lecture on social media, which he attributes to the generation gap. While most current medical students have grown up using social media, their professors didn’t, and may not be prepared to advise them on the peculiarities of the health care internet.

In a piece for Slate in November 2018, medical student Vishal Khetpal wrote about how organizations and companies would approach him and his classmates to appear in white coats while endorsing products or attending events despite the fact that they weren’t actually doctors yet.

“The uncharted ethics of social media are already confusing,” he writes, “and that’s before you add in the influence of outside interests, many of which are ready to take advantage of students’ ability to offer some stamp of medical authority to the general public about a product or idea without asking too many questions.”

“Anyone who thinks they’re going to stop the use of social media by physicians or nurses is over 40.

Confusion over what’s okay to post is a constant struggle. It’s why Chiang has launched the Association for Healthcare Social Media, which is currently in the process of obtaining a 501c3 designation before opening itself up to members.

“I think a lot of physicians are almost scared to get on social media because of the restrictive nature of how things were worded in the past,” he says. “We want people to share their experiences and share their expertise.”

Traditionally, health care professionals were discouraged from revealing anything about their personal lives in the public. But, thanks in part to Instagram, that’s changing.

“[There are] some old fogies who think, ‘Well, doctors shouldn’t be sharing personal information or talking about their lives in places the patients could find it, blah, blah,’” Caplan says. “Anyone who thinks they’re going to stop the use of social media by physicians or nurses is over 40. It’s just not going to stop. We have to adjust.”

Kahng, for her part, says that now, she makes sure to teach her USC students to build up their social media presence. “They invest so much money into their education and at the end of it, who knows?” she says. “They may not like dentistry, and I want them to have a following so that they don’t feel quite as trapped. They have something to lean on.”

The Daily 202: Facebook’s political problems grow as its co-founder calls for breaking up the social network,"Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive and founder of Facebook, speaks at a developers conference in San Jose last week. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)

With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: Mark Zuckerberg’s got 99 problems, and Chris Hughes is now one.

Hughes, who co-founded Facebook with Zuckerberg in a Harvard dorm room 15 years ago, makes a passionate and lengthy case for breaking up the social media giant in an op-ed that just published online and will appear in Sunday’s print edition of the New York Times. NPR and NBC aired interviews this morning with Hughes as part of his rollout.

“Mark’s power is unprecedented and un-American,” writes Hughes, a liberal who once owned the New Republic magazine. “Facebook’s dominance is not an accident of history. The company’s strategy was to beat every competitor in plain view, and regulators and the government tacitly — and at times explicitly — approved.”

Hughes faults regulators for being asleep at the wheel and specifically criticizes the Federal Trade Commission for approving of Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. “Mark’s influence is staggering, far beyond that of almost anyone else in the private sector or in government,” he writes. “The most problematic aspect of Facebook’s power is Mark’s unilateral control over speech. There is no precedent for his ability to monitor, organize and even censor the conversations of two billion people.”

-- Facebook has increasingly been squeezed from the right and the left. The company’s brand has taken an enormous hit since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which spawned a series of investigations and intense scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, from the European Union to Canada and the U.S. Congress.

-- Zuckerberg has been trying to get out front of calls to break up his company by calling for new regulations, expressing openness to more oversight and promising users recently that the social network will reorient itself to prioritize privacy. The 34-year-old is worth an estimated $62.3 billion. Forbes pegs him as the eighth richest person in the world.

-- Facebook isn’t afraid of “a few more rules,” Hughes explains, because the company can afford to comply with them and pay billions in fines. Facebook recorded $15 billion in revenue during the first three months of this year, for instance, putting the publicly traded company on a pace to rake in $60 billion this year. The tech giant disclosed to shareholders last month that it expects a fine as high as $5 billion from the FTC for its mishandling of its users’ personal information, and the markets shrugged.

Hughes believes that the federal government bringing an antitrust case is the only way to bring real accountability, which he believes is why Facebook is so strongly against it. “Mark may never have a boss, but he needs to have some check on his power,” Hughes writes. “The American government needs to do two things: break up Facebook’s monopoly and regulate the company to make it more accountable to the American people. … Just breaking up Facebook is not enough. We need a new agency, empowered by Congress to regulate tech companies. Its first mandate should be to protect privacy.”

-- President Trump threatened last Friday to “monitor” social media sites for their “censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS” on the day after Facebook permanently banned far-right figures and organizations including the conspiracy theory site Infowars. The company also permanently banned users including Louis Farrakhan, the founder of the Nation of Islam who has been accused of anti-Semitism, along with far-right figures Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer and Alex Jones, the founder of Infowars. The company said their presence on Facebook and Instagram had become “dangerous.”

-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has made breaking up Facebook and other big tech companies a major plank of her 2020 platform. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate subcommittee that oversees antitrust and competition policy, talks constantly about the danger of monopolies on the campaign trail. This is not some obscure debate for law school faculty lounges any longer. Crowds eat it up — in rural Iowa.

Hughes links Facebook’s market power to the staggering, broader consolidation of corporate power. “In the past 20 years, more than 75 percent of American industries, from airlines to pharmaceuticals, have experienced increased concentration, and the average size of public companies has tripled,” Hughes notes. “The results are a decline in entrepreneurship, stalled productivity growth, and higher prices and fewer choices for consumers.”

He laments that Facebook has become almost too big to fail in the eyes of regulators. “The company’s strategy was to beat every competitor in plain view, and regulators and the government tacitly — and at times explicitly — approved,” he writes. “This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern: first outrage, then disappointment and, finally, resignation.”

-- A bipartisan group of senators expressed frustration earlier this week with the slow-going federal probe into Facebook’s privacy practices, pushing the FTC to move more swiftly and consider imposing tough punishments that target the company’s top executives. “This investigation has been long delayed in conclusion — raising the specter of a remedy that is too little too late,” Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) wrote in an open letter on Monday. “The public is rightly asking whether Facebook is too big to be held accountable. The FTC must set a resounding precedent that is heard by Facebook and any other tech company that disregards the law in a rapacious quest for growth.”

-- Democratic lawmakers like Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) have even been pushing the FTC to specifically and personally target Zuckerberg himself as part of its investigation.

-- Many senior Democrats on Capitol Hill were especially irate about the public support that senior Facebook executive Joel Kaplan showed for Brett Kavanaugh after Christine Blasey Ford came forward last year. The company said Kaplan, a Republican and Facebook’s policy chief, was acting in his personal capacity when he sat behind Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing and hosted a party at his house for the justice to celebrate his triumph despite the allegations of sexual assault. This led to strong internal backlash from employees at Facebook. During an all-staff meeting, Kaplan said he should have checked with Zuckerberg ahead of time.

The donnybrook strained some of the company’s relationships on the Hill and put in stark relief for congressional Democrats that Facebook is neither their friend nor ally. Facebook reinforced this view the week before last by hiring another Republican legal operative who worked with Kavanaugh during George W. Bush’s administration to be their general counsel. To be sure, the company has also hired some prominent privacy advocates lately for other jobs.

Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has also lost a lot of her cachet with Democrats in D.C. She admitted in November that she received information about the company’s work with a Republican-aligned firm called Definers that conducted opposition research against the company’s critics on the left, including Democratic donor George Soros.

-- Meanwhile, there are daily reminders of how central Facebook has become in American culture. Consider these three unrelated stories that have posted in the past day:

Thousands of people who police Facebook's site for offensive content are contractors, not employees, and they’re starting to air their grievances about unsatisfactory working conditions. They’re protesting micromanagement, pay cuts and inadequate counseling support while they perform one of Facebook’s most demanding jobs. (Elizabeth Dwoskin)

Facebook is auto-generating videos that celebrate extremist images. A whistleblower’s complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges the social media giant has exaggerated its success at staying ahead of extremists by taking down their posts. Instead, the company has inadvertently made use of extremist propaganda in promotional videos that collect a year’s worth of user content to make snazzy videos. (AP)

Instagram still has no control over the spread of vaccine misinformation on its platform, two months after Facebook promised that it would do a better job of combating the falsehoods. “Instagram executives said vaccine misinformation is not eligible for recommendation to its Explore, hashtag and search pages. But discussion about vaccines as a general topic is still allowed and can be recommended in these places,” CNN reports. “An Instagram spokesperson added that its efforts are focused on vaccine misinformation, not the anti-vax movement. This means that Instagram wants to curtail false information about vaccines, but not ban people who identify as anti-vaxers or publish anti-vaccine posts.”

-- In his piece for the Times, Hughes apologizes for his role. “I’m disappointed in myself and the early Facebook team for not thinking more about how the News Feed algorithm could change our culture, influence elections and empower nationalist leaders,” he writes.

Hughes doesn’t fault Zuckerberg for trying to conquer the world. “Yet he has created a leviathan that crowds out entrepreneurship and restricts consumer choice,” he writes. “It’s on our government to ensure that we never lose the magic of the invisible hand.”

-- North Korea launched two short-range missiles. This is the second such test launch in less than a week amid rising tensions between Washington and Pyongyang. It came around 4:30 p.m. local time and appeared to have been fired from Sino-ri, a base that houses medium-range ballistic missiles. (Simon Denyer)

-- Kim Jong Un might be lashing out because of a worsening food shortage. Denyer explains: “Analysts say there is no doubt that the ultimate blame for the humanitarian crisis rests with Pyongyang, which has spent hugely on nuclear advances and other military projects while neglecting the welfare of ordinary citizens. But leading medical and humanitarian experts also argue that U.S.-led sanctions — which include fuel imports — have also stifled North Korean agriculture and prevented the arrival of vital medical aid. … A United Nations report issued Friday showed more than 10 million people do not have enough food to last until the next harvest.”

-- Meanwhile, Beijing promised tit-for-tat retaliation if Trump follows through tomorrow with his threat to put new tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Anna Fifield and David J. Lynch report: “The Chinese warning — issued as China’s vice premier arrived in Washington — signaled that Beijing was prepared to take the same hard-line route as Trump and raise tariffs on American products in response. ‘An escalation in trade frictions is not in line with the American or Chinese interests or the interests of the world, and would thus be much to China’s regret,’ a spokesman for the Commerce Ministry said in a statement on its website. ‘But if the U.S. goes ahead with its tariff measures against China, China will have to resort to necessary countermeasures,’ the statement added.”

THERE’S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- The House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt of Congress, hours after Trump asserted executive privilege over special counsel Bob Mueller’s report. Rachael Bade, Carol D. Leonnig and Matt Zapotosky report: “Democrats could vote as early as next week on the Barr contempt citation ... That vote would enable House counsels to take Barr to civil court and try to persuade a judge to force him to release Mueller’s evidence, one of many high-stakes legal fights between the executive and legislative branches. … House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Wednesday that Trump is ‘becoming self-impeachable’ because of all his efforts to fight congressional investigations, though she has remained firm in her resistance to initiate impeachment proceedings ahead of the 2020 election.

“The Justice Department considered it important for the White House to assert executive privilege before the House voted on contempt because, in its view, doing so would effectively invalidate the citation ... It believed that Barr could not be legitimately held in contempt for withholding materials over which the president had asserted executive privilege ... But if anything, Barr’s move only redoubled Democrats’ insistence to press ahead with contempt. During a day-long hearing, Democrats criticized the use of privilege as illegitimate because much of the Mueller report has already been made public — and because Trump allowed his aides to cooperate with the special counsel months ago.”

-- Donald Trump Jr. has been subpoenaed by the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee after the president’s eldest son stonewalled for several weeks in response to a request for a second interview. Ashley Parker, Karoun Demirjian and Shane Harris report: “As negotiations over Trump Jr.’s testimony dragged on, committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) became increasingly frustrated and believed that Trump Jr. was defying the committee’s authority and not honoring his original agreement. … If Trump Jr. flouts the subpoena, it puts Burr in the awkward position of potentially taking Trump Jr. to court as the president continues his standoff with the House. ... Trump Jr. is ‘exasperated’ by the committee’s actions, according to a person who has discussed the subpoena with him, because he already ‘offered to continue to cooperate in writing.’

“The panel is bringing back several key witnesses for second interviews to give lawmakers a chance to question people previously interviewed only by committee staffers … But concerns about Trump Jr.’s statements are potentially more problematic for the president. According to a transcript of Trump Jr.’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he told lawmakers that he did not tell his father about the Trump Tower meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.

“Trump Jr.’s testimony to other committees was in line with the account he gave to the Senate Judiciary panel, several Democrats said. Yet in Mueller’s report, the president’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he recalled being in Trump’s office when Trump Jr. talked about a meeting to get ‘adverse information’ on Clinton. Cohen told Mueller’s team that it appeared that father and son had previously discussed the subject. Mueller never interviewed Trump Jr.”

-- Trump’s legal team urged a federal judge last night to block the House Oversight Committee’s subpoena for financial statements from the president’s accounting firm, calling the request “unconstitutional.” Spencer S. Hsu reports: “In a 24-page filing, Trump’s legal team asked the D.C. court to block a committee subpoena to Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, saying the panel’s demand ‘lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.’ Even if there were one, Trump’s lawyers argued, the newly elected Democratic-led House overstepped its authority by passing a campaign finance and ethics bill as its first legislation in January that would require, among other things, the president and the vice president to make public 10 years of tax returns.”

-- The New York State Senate approved legislation allowing congressional committees to access Trump’s state tax returns. Jeff Stein reports: “The bill must still be approved by the State Assembly and signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D-N.Y.), but Cuomo has expressed support for the measure and Democrats have a majority in the legislature’s lower chamber. … New York’s legislation would not give House Democrats access to the six years of federal tax returns sought by House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.). But the state returns could provide an unprecedented look into Trump’s New York business dealings, his income, and a range of other personal financial information, according to legal experts.”

-- The bigger picture: Trump's refusal to cooperate with Congress is setting the stage for a constitutional crisis. Devlin Barrett, Carol D. Leonnig and Josh Dawsey report: “On the surface, the fight over an unredacted copy of Mueller’s report — and its underlying investigative documents — hinges on disagreements over the law surrounding grand jury material and legal precedents. But at its heart, Wednesday’s dispute is about the seemingly in­trac­table conflict between House Democrats, who are seeking a public airing of damaging details about Trump, and the president, who has vowed to give them nothing. The two sides now appear headed for a court fight over the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, and at a faster pace than previous legal battles over executive privilege. Each appears to be proceeding with an eye on how such a conflict might play out in the 2020 race for president and the possibility, however faint, of impeachment proceedings.

“In past administrations, conflicts over congressional access to White House documents and witnesses have often dragged on for a year or longer before reaching this stage of impasse. … With the Mueller report, it took only weeks to reach the state, and may serve as an important test case for ongoing fights between the White House and Congress.”

-- FBI officials will brief members of Florida’s congressional delegation next week on suspected Russian hacking during the 2016 election. Politico’s Gary Fineout reports: “The agency will sit down Republican Sen. Rick Scott ahead of the delegation meeting. … Mueller last month revealed the suspected hacking in a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The disclosure jolted Florida officials, who had previously insisted the Russians had been unsuccessful in their hacking efforts.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- “Trump is questioning his administration’s aggressive strategy in Venezuela following the failure of a U.S.-backed effort to oust President Nicolás Maduro, complaining he was misled about how easy it would be to replace the socialist strongman with a young opposition figure,” per Anne Gearan, Josh Dawsey, John Hudson and Seung Min Kim. “The president’s dissatisfaction has crystallized around national security adviser John Bolton … Trump has said in recent days that Bolton wants to get him ‘into a war’ — a comment he has made in jest in the past but that now belies his more serious concerns, one senior administration official said. Trump has complained over the last week that Bolton and others underestimated Maduro, according to three senior administration officials … Trump has expressed concern that Bolton has boxed him into a corner and gone beyond where he is comfortable.

“The events of April 30 have effectively shelved serious discussion of a heavy U.S. military response, current and former officials as well as outside advisers said. Rather, U.S. officials think time is on their side and that Maduro will fall of his own weight. … Trump is now not inclined to have any sort of military intervention in Venezuela … Trump has, in Oval Office meetings and phone calls with advisers, questioned his administration providing such strong support of [Juan] Guaidó. Some White House officials said Trump likes the charismatic leader, whom he has called courageous, but has wondered aloud whether he is ready to take over and about how much the administration really knows about him.

“U.S. defense leaders regard any military scenario involving boots on the ground in Venezuela as a quagmire and warn that standoff weapons such as Tomahawk missiles run a major risk of killing civilians. The White House has repeatedly asked for military planning short of an invasion, however. Officials said the options under discussion while Maduro is still in power include sending additional military assets to the region, increasing aid to neighboring countries such as Colombia and other steps to provide humanitarian assistance to displaced Venezuelans outside of Venezuela. More forward-leaning options include sending ships to waters off Venezuela as a show of force. Other steps under discussion are intended for after Maduro is gone, when U.S. military personnel might be permitted inside Venezuela to help with humanitarian responses.”

-- Masked Venezuelan intelligence police detained the vice president of the National Assembly late last night in a dramatic operation in eastern Caracas, marking the first senior opposition official taken into custody by the Maduro regime in retaliation for last week’s failed military uprising. Anthony Faiola reports: “Assembly Vice President Edgar Zambrano live-tweeted the detention, saying his van was surrounded by forces from Venezuela’s SEBIN police force. When he refused to exit, Zambrano said, his vehicle was forcibly towed to the infamous Helicoide prison, a notorious holding area for political prisoners. The move came after Zambrano became one of 10 opposition officials charged with treason, conspiracy and rebellion by the pro-Maduro Supreme Court in connection to the April 30 plot. Thus far, the leader of the uprising — Guaidó, who has been recognized as Venezuela’s rightful leader by the United States and more than 50 other nations — has not been charged.”

-- U.S. allies in Latin America want change in Venezuela, but they’re very much against military intervention. Karen DeYoung reports: “Latin Americans, who already see the Venezuelan crisis spilling over their borders in the form of millions of refugees, appreciate U.S. interest and determination. … [But] the history of U.S. invasion and occupation in the region, along with covert involvement in regime change, is long and unlamented. Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Haiti, Cuba, Chile, and more. Even those leaders who might be happy to see [Maduro] ousted with U.S. force believe there would be a heavy price to pay among their own constituents.”

MORE ESCALATION AGAINST IRAN:

-- Mike Pompeo canceled a scheduled visit to Greenland so he can return to Washington to manage the Iran situation. (AP)

-- The Trump administration issued new sanctions against Iran, targeting its metal exports, hours after the Iranian president threatened to start enriching more uranium if it doesn’t get relief from U.S. measures that are crippling its economy. The new round of sanctions, outlined in an executive order, apply to Iranian iron, steel, aluminum and copper, Carol Morello reports: “Trump said the newest sanctions target a sector that generates 10 percent of its export revenue. ‘Tehran can expect further actions unless it fundamentally alters its conduct,’ Trump said. ‘Since our exit from the Iran deal, which is broken beyond repair, the United States has put forward 12 conditions that offer the basis of a comprehensive agreement with Iran. I look forward to someday meeting with the leaders of Iran in order to work out an agreement and, very importantly, taking steps to give Iran the future it deserves.’”

-- U.S. government sources say that Iran has approved attacks on American troops, NBC News Pentagon correspondent Courtney Kube reports: “The intelligence shows that an Iranian official discussed activating Iranian-backed groups to target Americans, but did not mention targeting the militaries of other nations, the officials said. Among the specific threats the U.S. military is now tracking, officials say, are possible missile attacks by Iranian dhows, or small ships, in the Persian Gulf; attacks in Iraq by Iranian-trained Shiite militia groups; and attacks against U.S. ships by the Houthi rebels in Yemen. … (They) say that in addition to learning that an Iranian official had discussed attacks on Americans, the U.S. began seeing the movement of Iranian and Iranian-backed forces in various places across the region, prompting the commander of U.S. Central Command, Marine Corps Gen. Frank McKenzie, to request additional forces move to the region.”

THE REALITY TV PRESIDENCY:

-- At a conference last night in Las Vegas for hedge fund investors, former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci interviewed the man who fired him: Former White House chief of staff John Kelly. They said they’ve become friends and vented about their time in the Trump administration. The Daily Beast’s Tarpley Hitt reports: “Scaramucci questioned the former chief of staff about … curbing the president’s Twitter use (‘That’s not my job.’), the Mueller Report (‘I tried aggressively to stay out of it.’), and whether Trump is a stable genius (‘I wouldn’t pass judgement on either of those.’)”

-- During the first stop of her latest tell-all tour, Stormy Daniels said she’s not sure if Trump, who she says had an extramarital affair with her, is worse than her former lawyer, Michael Avenatti. The adult-film star also said she’ll apologize to first lady Melania Trump only when “she apologizes to the country.” The Daily Beast’s Amy Zimmerman reports: “Near the end of the evening, an audience member asked Daniels about Trump’s hypothetical future downfall. … ‘Allowing someone to get away with things that are definitely illegal sets a very terrifying precedent,’ Daniels continued, explaining to the crowd that she was choosing her words very deliberately. ‘It’s basically a green light.’ ‘Do I think he’ll be re-elected? I don’t know,’ she concluded. ‘I hope not.’”

-- The Florida Bar said an investigation will proceed into whether one of Trump's closest allies on the Hill, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), attempted to intimidate Michael Cohen, who is now in prison after arranging hush money payments to Daniels. The Tampa Bay Times’s Steve Contorno reports: “A grand jury-like panel called the Grievance Committee will next decide whether there is probable cause that Gaetz’s tweet broke the state Supreme Court’s rules for lawyers. … In moving the case against Gaetz to this step, the Florida Bar is also signaling that its initial review determined that the allegations against Gaetz would, if proven true, be a violation of the rules. … The complaint against Gaetz stems from a menacing tweet he sent on Feb. 27, the eve of Cohen’s testimony before a House committee. Gaetz wrote: ‘Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she’ll remain faithful when you’re in prison. She’s about to learn a lot… .’”

THE SWAMP IS NOT DRAINED:

-- Trump derailed a bipartisan casino bill yesterday after a high-priced lobbyist married to one of his staffers said that doing so would hurt 2020 candidate and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D). Mike DeBonis, Felicia Sonmez and Josh Dawsey report: “The intervention by Trump, contained in a morning tweet, eroded Republican support and prompted House Democrats to postpone a vote on the measure, which would pave the way for a new Massachusetts tribal casino. The bill, H.R. 312, would confirm the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe’s sovereignty over 321 acres of land — including the Taunton, Mass., site eyed for the casino project. It was scheduled for a House vote Wednesday under expedited procedures requiring a two-thirds majority to pass, reflecting its broad support.”

Follow the money: American Conservative Union Chairman Matthew Schlapp, who organizes CPAC, is lobbying for Twin River Management Group, which operates two Rhode Island casinos that fear the competition from a new casino across the state line. Schlapp’s wife, Mercedes, is White House strategic communications director. “The singular focus on Warren appeared to reflect a strategy embraced by Schlapp, who focused on the senator in a Wednesday morning tweet and an email he sent to Republicans on Capitol Hill Tuesday,” per Mike, Felicia and Josh. “According to a person familiar with the circumstances surrounding the tweet, Trump was happy to attack the project once he learned it was a key priority for Warren. … In a brief phone interview, Schlapp asked for questions to be texted to him but did not respond to a text or a subsequent phone call.”

Irony alert: Warren is not actually a sponsor of the bill. She co-sponsored similar legislation in the last Congress, but there’s no pending Senate bill pertaining to the tribe. “It is also not lost on anybody that a lobbyist for the Rhode Island casino seems to have a very tight relationship with the White House,” said Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), who represents the district where the new casino would go. “It’s sad. The consequence of this is going to be that the tribe that greeted the Pilgrims gets hurt once again by the U.S. government.”

-- Trump publicly endorsed a super PAC run by his allies, America First Action, after strenuously criticizing such groups during the 2016 election. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: “In October 2015, then-candidate [Trump] railed against his opponents and the political committees raising huge sums to try and boot him out of the primaries. 'They’re in total cahoots with their [super] PACs, which they’re not allowed to be,' Trump told The Washington Post at the time. … But on Tuesday, [Trump] made a sharp about-face … Candidates and the independent super PACs that support them have increasingly found ways to work together without breaking laws barring outright coordination. But the Trump reelection campaign’s statement appeared to go further than any other.”

-- “The White House revoked my press pass. It’s not just me — it’s curtailing access for all journalists,” by Post columnist Dana Milbank: “For the past 21 years, I have had the high privilege of holding a White House press pass, a magical ticket that gives the bearer a front-row seat to history. … But no more. The White House eliminated most briefings and severely restricted access to official events. And this week came the coup de grace: After covering four presidents, I received an email informing me that Trump’s press office had revoked my White House credential. … I strongly suspect it’s because I’m a Trump critic. The move is perfectly in line with Trump’s banning of certain news organizations, including The Post, from his campaign events and his threats to revoke White House credentials of journalists he doesn’t like.”

-- White House officials acknowledged they're slashing the number of journalists who hold “hard “press passes to get into the building. But they claim it's not about limiting access. Paul Farhi reports: “White House press secretary Sarah Sanders explicitly denied that, saying the changes were prompted by security concerns, not to punish journalists. ... Sanders said the new measures were prompted by the U.S. Secret Service’s concern about the proliferation of hard passes, particularly over the past three years. It’s unclear exactly how many journalists hold hard passes, but White House officials say there could be as many as a thousand in existence.”

THE REST OF THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- Trump tweeted support for a plan by General Motors to sell a recently shuttered plant in Ohio to Workhorse Group, an electric vehicle company that employs fewer than 100 people. Heather Long reports: “Representatives of both companies expressed optimism that they can complete a deal, although they stressed that talks are in early stages and that any agreement would have to be approved by the United Automobile Workers union. … But the UAW indicated it would continue to push for GM to bring a new vehicle to Lordstown. … Trump promised to bring back blue-collar jobs to the Rust Belt, and the closing of the Lordstown factory, located in a county that swung from blue to red in the last presidential election, has been a sore mark on his promises to working America.”

-- Trump will ask the Supreme Court to prevent lower courts from imposing nationwide injunctions against his policies. Bloomberg News’s Margaret Talev and Greg Stohr report: Vice President “Pence complained Wednesday in a speech to the conservative Federalist Society that federal district courts have imposed more nationwide injunctions against Trump than the first 40 presidents combined. … The Trump administration has already tried on several occasions to persuade the Supreme Court to curb nationwide injunctions.”

-- Internal memos reveal that EPA leaders ignored the advice of the agency’s own scientists and lawyers, who urged the officials to issue an outright ban on asbestos. The New York Times’s Lisa Friedman reports: “Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval. Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.”

-- The House Appropriations Committee voted to block a new Trump administration rule allowing health workers to refuse to provide services that violate their religious beliefs. Erica Werner reports: “The measure by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) would prevent spending to implement the new rule, which Trump announced last week during a speech before faith leaders. The broad new rule allows health-care providers, insurers and employers to refuse to provide or pay for services that violate their religious or moral beliefs, such as abortion or assisted suicide ... Republicans argued against Lee’s amendment, describing it as a ‘poison pill’ that would ensure that the broader legislation being debated Wednesday — a sweeping spending bill for the Health and Human Services, Labor and Education departments — would never become law.”

THE IMMIGRATION WARS:

-- The number of border crossers detained by U.S. authorities topped 100,000 for the second consecutive month in April. Nick Miroff reports: “U.S. Customs and Border Protection detained 109,144 migrants along the boundary with Mexico last month, a 6 percent increase from March, as monthly arrests reached their highest point since 2007. Unauthorized border crossings have more than doubled in the past year, and they are on pace to exceed 1 million on an annual basis … ‘Our apprehension numbers are off the charts,’ Carla Provost, chief of the Border Patrol, said in testimony to senators … ‘We cannot address this crisis by shifting more resources. It’s like holding a bucket under a faucet. It doesn’t matter how many buckets we have if we can’t turn off the flow.’ … DHS officials for the first time this week said the agency is running out of space to jail single adult migrants, who arrived in April at the highest level in five years. One DHS official warned of a complete border breakdown if single adults who cross illegally can no longer be detained and deported.”

-- Nearly half of white Republicans say it would bother them “some” or “a lot” to “hear people speak a language other than English in a public place,” according to a new Pew survey. Eighteen percent of white Democrats said they would be bothered by hearing a foreign language, compared to 47 percent of white Republicans. (Christopher Ingraham)

-- Immigration and Customs Enforcement spent nearly a million dollars on iPhone hacking equipment made by tech company Grayshift. Forbes’s Thomas Brewster reports: “The Atlanta-based company makes the GrayKey, previously described as the world's best iPhone hacking tech for police and intelligence agents, allowing them to break passcodes and retrieve information from inside Apple devices. The contract, signed just last week, takes the immigration department's spend with the company to over $1.2 million, following a $384,000 Grayshift deal last year. That's the most spent on the superpowered iPhone hacking service by any government department, local or federal, looking across public records.”

-- RAICES, a nonprofit immigrant legal services group, accused ICE of preventing immigrants from receiving free legal help at a detention facility in Karnes, Tex. NBC News’s Suzanne Gamboa reports: “The complaints are many and include such things as ICE failing to make space available for private meetings with clients, setting new requirements for lawyers to meet with clients, so that fewer people can meet with attorneys, and eliminating a ‘walk-in’ signup list. … In its eight-page complaint, RAICES said that ICE has stopped following its own policies, based on its own detention standards, that were implemented in 2014. The policies, though imperfect, allowed people detained in Karnes access to counsel at no government expense, RAICES said.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Campaigning for reelection during a rally in Florida last night, Trump pledged more federal aid for the state and blamed Democrats for his administration's flagging hurricane recovery efforts. Toluse Olorunnipa and Reis Thebault report: “Trump announced he would allocate $448 million of Housing and Urban Development recovery money to the Florida relief effort. Trump has also sought to blame Democrats for the lack of aid and has claimed Puerto Rico is undeserving of more federal funds to deal with the aftermath of devastating hurricanes in 2017. To illustrate his point, Trump pulled a small bar chart out of his suit coat and held it up to the crowd. Puerto Rico, he said, has received more relief money than any other state or territory, falsely claiming that the federal government had provided Puerto Rico with $91 billion in aid. ‘That’s Puerto Rico,’ Trump said, pointing to the tallest bar. ‘And they don’t like me.’”

-- Kamala Harris is adopting a new strategy to confront Trump more directly, reacting to Joe Biden’s successful rollout in the wake of disagreements among her top advisers about the extent to which the California Democrat should embrace far-left policies that could make her unelectable in a general election. The New York Times’s Astead W. Herndon and Jonathan Martin report: “She has repeatedly sought to placate the left since setting her sights on the presidency — an impulse many in her orbit say is reinforced by her campaign chair, Maya Harris, her sister. At the same time, other Harris advisers and allies have winced at some of the senator’s overtures to liberals … But two recent events — Ms. Harris’s insistent questioning of Mr. Barr at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week, and [Biden’s] multiday spat with Mr. Trump — have been clarifying moments for Ms. Harris and her aides, demonstrating the value of elevating her voice of opposition to the president and seeking direct confrontation with the White House, according to her advisers.”

-- Pete Buttigieg blindsided Harris in California, capturing the attention of state Democrats with ties to the LGBTQ and Hollywood communities. Politico’s Carla Marinucci reports: “Democratic strategist Garry South says the growing buzz about Buttigieg’s success in wedging his way into California’s lucrative fundraising base has shocked many longtime politics watchers in the state. ‘I think the amazing thing is that nobody is ceding California to Kamala Harris ... no one is abandoning California to the native daughter — which tells you something,’ he says. … Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who presides over one of the country’s most lucrative Democratic fundraising ATMs, hasn’t yet endorsed in the crowded 2020 presidential race. He freely admits experiencing some angst over the situation. ‘I love Kamala Harris, she’s a dear friend,’’ he says of the former state attorney general, who has scheduled a dizzying round of fundraisers in the state next week. But, Garcetti notes, Buttigieg ‘is one of my closest mayor friends.’”

-- Elizabeth Warren called for spending $100 billion in federal money to address the opioid crisis. Annie Linskey and Katie Zezima report: “Most Democrats believe their path to the White House involves winning back industrial states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania whose populations have been badly hurt by addiction … ‘Trump has been all talk and no action,’ Warren said … She waved off a question about whether the president, who campaigned on solving the opioid crisis, had at least focused attention on the issue. … ‘He hasn’t made it a priority,’ [Warren said]. ... Trump appointed a commission in 2017 that made 56 recommendations on combating the scourge. The administration has also successfully prodded China to tighten its regulation of fentanyl-related substances.”

-- The “electability” argument ignores the reality that primary voters always end up choosing a candidate who reflects the political moment, Amy Walter writes in a smart piece for the Cook Political Report: “This year, many Democrats are using 2016 as the lens through which they view the 2020 campaign. … A lot of Democrats look at Biden and think he would've won in 2016 and as such see him as the safest choice for 2020. If however, Biden starts to look like a risky bet (he stumbles in a debate, bumbles on the trail, etc) the rationale on which his campaign is based collapses. The winner of the 2020 primary will be the candidate who can prove he/she is best suited for the unique challenges of the upcoming campaign, not the one who is still fighting over what they should do the same/differently from 2016.”

-- Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz appears to be backing away from an independent presidential bid, fueling speculation that Biden’s entry into the race has made him reconsider. The Daily Beast’s Sam Stein and Gideon Resnick report: “Erin McPike, a spokesperson for Schultz, said there was a simple reason for [recent] canceled events: he was ‘taking a break while he is recovering from back surgery.’ … But Schultz has also dialed down the elements of his campaign prep that don’t actually require public appearances. He has not posted to Facebook or Instagram since April 30. … According to Facebook's ad archives, Schultz has not run an ad on the platform since April 23, when his account posted a spot that declared ‘It's Time To Un-Partisan.’ Since Easter, Schultz has tweeted just twice.”

-- Republicans hired nine regional directors for Trump’s 2020 reelection team. From the Wall Street Journal’s Michael C. Bender: “The campaign has carved the nation into nine regions as it decides how best to spend its resources on contacting voters, motivating supporters and, eventually, getting them to the polls on Election Day, according to campaign officials. Each area will be overseen by a newly hired regional political director. One of those regions is focused almost exclusively on Michigan and Pennsylvania, both states that hadn’t supported a Republican presidential candidate for 28 years until Mr. Trump. Wisconsin, which hadn’t supported a Republican for 32 years until 2016, is in a region that also includes Ohio, a traditional battleground.”

-- Bernie Sanders’s 2009 tax returns showed that a series of errors caused him to underpay his taxes by $4,479. The Wall Street Journal’s Richard Rubin reports: “The handwritten document contained four mistakes: three that reduced Mr. Sanders’s reported taxes and one that increased them ... according to Illinois accountant Glen Birnbaum.”

-- “What it’s like to watch my college boyfriend, Beto O’Rourke, run for president,” by Sasha Watson for The Post's Sunday Magazine: “I found myself in the strange circumstance of sitting in my car on a late-winter afternoon and recalling — with a [reporter] — life in my early 20s, and what it had been like for Beto and me to fall in love. … I’ve received more messages from reporters since then, but I’ve mostly stopped responding. … They don’t see a story in the fond or funny recollections I might offer, but there is a story, I think, and it’s not in the ‘salacious details’ one reporter told me he was seeking. Instead, it has to do with seeing a person emerge from the long tunnel of memory and shared history to stand in the public eye; about seeing someone become more than a person — or maybe less — when he’s turned into a symbol.”

-- Mitch McConnell has embraced the nickname “Cocaine Mitch.” A shirt sold on the majority leader's campaign website that features his likeness and a dusting of cocaine has gone viral. Reis Thebault reports: “Roughly a year ago, GOP Senate candidate from West Virginia and former coal magnate Don Blankenship aired a campaign advertisement that referred to McConnell, without any context, as ‘Cocaine Mitch.’ It was an apparent nod to a years-old allegation that the family of McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, has a shipping background connected to drug dealers. … Some policy experts have criticized McConnell and his campaign for selling products that reference and, they say, make light of drug issues.”

VACCINATE YOUR KIDS:

-- The brother, sister and a niece of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused their relative of spreading misinformation about vaccines. They write an op-ed for Politico: “Robert F. Kennedy Jr. … is part of this campaign to attack the institutions committed to reducing the tragedy of preventable infectious diseases. He has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines. We love Bobby. He is one of the great champions of the environment. His work to clean up the Hudson River and his tireless advocacy against multinational organizations who have polluted our waterways and endangered families has positively affected the lives of countless Americans. We stand behind him in his ongoing fight to protect our environment. However, on vaccines he is wrong.”

-- A Republican state legislator in Texas attacked a leading vaccine scientist on Twitter, accusing the doctor of “sorcery.” Deanna Paul reports: “It started with a report published Monday by the Texas Department of State Health Services that noted the state recorded a 14 percent rise in parents opting out of their children’s vaccinations. It was a new statistic that alarmed Peter Hotez, professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. … Hotez took his concerns about the report to Twitter. And then he received an unexpected, seething personal attack from the Republican state legislator, Rep. Jonathan Stickland. ‘You are bought and paid for by the biggest special interest in politics,’ Stickland wrote. ‘Do our state a favor and mind your own business. Parental rights mean more to us than your self enriching ‘science.’’”

-- “A conservative Christian group is pushing Bible classes in public schools nationwide — and it’s working,” by Julie Zauzmer: “Scenes of Bible classes in public school could become increasingly common across the United States if other states follow Kentucky’s lead in passing legislation that encourages high schools to teach the Bible. Activists on the religious right, through their legislative effort Project Blitz, drafted a law that encourages Bible classes in public schools and persuaded at least 10 state legislatures to introduce versions of it this year. Georgia and Arkansas recently passed bills that are awaiting their governors’ signatures. Among the powerful fans of these public-school Bible classes: President Trump. ‘Numerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible,’ Trump tweeted in January. ‘Starting to make a turn back? Great!’”

-- “Nipsey Hussle had a plan to beat gentrification — in South L.A. and across the U.S.,"" by the Los Angeles Times's Angel Jennings: “In the months before Hussle was gunned down in front of his clothing store in late March, the rapper was working to bring economic development to the blighted blocks around Slauson and Crenshaw Boulevard, but on his own terms. He wanted more for his community, but he wanted the changes to be driven from within.”

-- Bill Burns, the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former deputy secretary of state, says Trump’s deal for Arab-Israeli peace is “doomed” by delusions in an op-ed for The Post: “In keeping with his disdain for conventional wisdom and his bent for disruption, Trump might bury what is still the only viable plan of action for Israelis and Palestinians, without offering anything resembling a workable substitute. Neither Trump nor his son-in-law and chief negotiator, Jared Kushner, invented the steady decay of the two-state solution in recent years, or the pathologies of regional leaders consumed by their grievances and short-term political concerns. … Based on what can be gleaned about the new plan, however, Trump and Kushner appear to be animated by a set of terminally flawed assumptions and illusions. … The administration has effectively abandoned dialogue with the Palestinian leadership and marginalized Palestinian concerns, embracing instead the agenda of the Israeli right. … In 3½ decades of government service, I never saw an American president concede so much, so soon, for so little.”

Then, a few hours later, early Wednesday morning, her husband shared his unfiltered thoughts about the interview on Twitter. In a series of since-deleted tweets, Ben Domenech, the founder and publisher of conservative website The Federalist, went on an unhinged rant against the late-night host and former head writer for Saturday Night Live that was at times homophobic and at other times suggested that Meyers has only succeeded in comedy because he is a white man.” HOT ON THE RIGHT: “‘Have you fed any children today?’: Lawmaker films himself heckling antiabortion protesters,” from Marisa Iati : “The confrontation outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia escalated quickly. A state legislator held up his phone and filmed himself saying the clinic was one of the most heavily protested in the country. Then he flipped the camera and approached a woman pacing the sidewalk with her back turned and a rosary in her hand. ‘How many children have you put shoes on their feet today?’ Pennsylvania state Rep. Brian Sims, a Democrat, asked the woman. … The incident, and another video in which Sims asks viewers to identify three young girls outside the clinic, have sparked outrage from Republican politicians and antiabortion activists, who said Sims’s behavior amounted to harassment.”

BILOXI, Miss. (AP) - Residents in a Mississippi Gulf Coast city continued on Tuesday to mourn the death of a longtime officer who authorities said was gunned down by a man whose mental health had, according to his mother, been sliding in recent months.

A local NAACP leader said the man had threatened to shoot his goddaughter in 2018 when both were high school students.

A public memorial service was held Tuesday evening for Biloxi Patrolman Robert McKeithen, who was shot to death in the parking lot outside the city's police station Sunday night. Darian Tawan Atkinson, 19, is jailed without bail on capital murder charges. McKeithen, a Biloxi officer for 23 years, was shot multiple times. It remains unclear whether the 58-year-old was targeted or shot at random.

Gulfport Police spokesman Lt. Joshua Bromen said search warrants were being served Tuesday. He declined to say whether a gun had been found.

Atkinson's mother, Pamela Broger, told The Associated Press that if her son shot McKeithen, it was because of mental health problems Broger said had developed in recent months.

""Darian went to Texas to work in August,"" Broger said. ""He came back two months later and he was a completely different person. I don't know if something happened there because he wouldn't talk to me. I don't know if it was drugs.""

Broger said she had called police officers for assistance, but said officers told her they couldn't do anything because Atkinson wasn't hurting anyone.

""I'm not saying he didn't do it,"" Broger said. ""But if he did, it was because he was suffering.""

She also denied that her older son, Davian Atkinson, had done anything to merit being arrested. The 21-year-old was booked into the Harrison County jail early Tuesday on an accessory charge alleging he aided his brother.

Broger said Darian Atkinson came home Sunday night when the family didn't know about the shooting, and left Monday in Davian Atkinson's car. Bromen said ""obviously something more is involved"" in the brother's charge, noting the mother wasn't charged.

Others see Darian differently than his mother. Biloxi NAACP chapter President James Crowell told the Sun Herald that Darian Atkinson threatened his goddaughter in February 2018 when the two were Biloxi High School students discussing the shooting at Florida's Parkland High School.

""He said, 'I'm thinking about doing the same thing here and I'm going to start with you,' "" Crowell said Tuesday.

He said that his goddaughter's family reported the threat to Biloxi High School, but nothing happened until they demanded an investigation. Crowell held a news conference at the time, saying parents should have been notified. WXXV-TV reported then that the accused student, never named publicly, was suspended for three days.

""Even back then, he was threatening people,"" Crowell said Tuesday. ""I guess he went ahead and did it this time rather than just talk about it.""

Spokeswoman Jennifer Pyron said privacy laws prevent release of student records. Gulfport Police Chief Leonard Papania, who's leading the investigation, didn't respond to a text from the AP.

At the police station where McKeithen was killed, mourners continued to deposit tributes on his police SUV, overflowing onto tables the city set up.

Patricia Underwood said she drove from Gulfport to pay her respects to a man who convinced her goddaughter to remain in high school. She said her goddaughter called her in tears Monday night.

""She just cried and cried,"" Underwood said. She said her goddaughter was working at a Biloxi Waffle House two years ago and told McKeithen, a regular at the restaurant, that she was thinking of dropping out.

""He told her she didn't need to get out of school; she needed to stay in and walk across that stage and graduate. And she did,"" Underwood said.

She was joined by Linda Virgil, who retired from a Dillard's department store where McKeithen did off-duty work as a security guard.

""He would stay later to walk us to our cars every night,"" she said.

She said he loved to talk about his wife and the diamond rings he bought her, and about his children. ""He helped everybody,"" Virgil said.

Biloxi Police Capt. Milton Houseman said he was one of the officers who brought in Atkinson. Asked if he had any idea why Atkinson smiled as he was brought into the police department after his arrest 40 miles (65 kilometers) away in Wiggins, Houseman said, ""I wouldn't venture a guess as to what was in his mind.""

Atkinson's first appearance in court could come as early as Wednesday, when a judge will consider bail and could appoint a lawyer. His brother Davian Atkinson is held on $500,000 bail.

State criminal records show no felony convictions for either Atkinson brother. Davian Atkinson was cited for speeding and other traffic offenses once in 2016 and once in 2017.

"It's part boat, part car and all fun. Meet the captain of Pensacola's boat car","Gerry Moore gets a lot of strange looks when he's out driving his Ford Expedition.

People roll down their windows, stick their phones out and take photos. Others slam on the brakes to do a double-take. Pedestrians walking by stand open-mouthed, then quickly reach into their bags to get their cameras.

Gerry is a good-looking guy, always wearing a white sailor's cap and he usually has a cigar dangling from his lips. His wife, Karen, is blonde and beautiful, and is usually sitting in the passenger's seat, waving at onlookers. Maybe that's why everyone wants to take photos.

Or perhaps it's because Gerry sawed off the top half of his Ford Expedition and replaced it with the top half of a 1986 Chris Craft Scorpion 210, an old boat he had sitting in his backyard for years.

""It definitely gets a reaction out of people,"" Gerry says with a laugh. ""Everybody smiles, they really do.""

""It's such a joy to see people's reactions,"" Karen says. ""They either have their camera out, or they're smiling and waving. Many of them just bust out laughing.""

Yes, it drives just like a car, and no, it doesn't float

Gerry first got the idea to build his ""boat car,"" as he calls it, at a car show in Mississippi late last year.

He saw a similar, smaller car/boat hybrid, and thought of the old Chris Craft he had sitting in his backyard off of Nine Mile Road in Pensacola. He'd been mulling refurbishing the boat for years, but never got around to spending the money to bring it back to life.

""So when I saw that boat car, I told my wife, 'That's what we're doing with our boat,'"" Gerry says. ""She said, 'I don't know how you are going to do that.'""

Gerry, who works as a poker dealer at the Pensacola Greyhound Track, grew up fixing cars with his dad in Little Rock, Arkansas. His dad owned several car service stations, and Gerry has always been comfortable tinkering with automobiles.

But his boat car project was one that he'd never done before. He measured his Cadillac Escalade and his boat and determined they'd be the perfect fit for one another, but Karen wouldn't let him chop the Escalade to pieces. So he found an old Ford Expedition that had front end damage and bought it for cheap.

""I didn't mind that it had front end damage,"" Gerry says. ""I cut the whole front end off anyways.""

Gerry worked for six weeks merging the boat and car together — ""That Chris Craft was built a little too good, I went through about 20 saws just to get the bottom off,"" he says — and eventually his masterpiece was complete. The boat car has the wheels, bottom frame, seats and steering wheel of the Expedition, but the body of the Chris Craft. It seats eight people and gets about 20 miles to the gallon.

And no, it doesn't float.

Gerry and Karen took the boat car, which they named ""Tsunami,"" for its first spin in Pensacola on Feb. 15, and the farthest he's driven since then is to Panama City and back. The boat car operates and drives just like an SUV and is licensed and insured as the Expedition. Gerry says he's been pulled over by the police ""around 10 times"" — but instead of writing him a ticket, they snap a picture.

""It's considered a Ford Expedition, with a slight body modification,"" he says with a laugh.

A lot of looks, laughs and smiles from perfect strangers

So, what's the point of spending six weeks creating a boat/car hybrid that Gerry and Karen just drive around for fun?

They both say it's the reactions they get from people that make it worthwhile.

Gerry survived thyroid cancer that metastasized to his lungs, and Karen is a two-time breast cancer survivor. They both still work, and are busy with three kids and nine grandkids. But they enjoy driving the boat car around in their free time, taking photos with people and giving rides to people to see the joy that it brings.

""I can have a rough day at work, and when I get home, he'll say, 'Let's go for a ride,'"" Karen says.

Gerry ordered several captains hats, like the one he wears, to give out to little kids who are fascinated by the boat car. One interaction with a little girl at a car show a few weeks ago still makes him tear up when he talks about it.

""There was a little girl who had leukemia, so I put her in the boat and gave her a captain's hat,"" Gerry says. ""Seeing a reaction like that in a child is no different than seeing these bums on the corner who have no food or anything else. Everybody's response is to wave and smile, and it just makes their day. And more importantly, it makes ours.""

""It tickles them to death to see the boat,"" Karen says of the little kids. ""And to have a hat like he has, that makes it so much more special.""

The Moores are open to the idea of letting people ""rent"" the boat car (with Gerry as its captain) for weddings or other events. It made its first big public debut at the Pensacola Grand Mardi Gras parade in March.

But for the most part, the Moores aren't looking to make a monetary profit off their ride. The reward they get from it is driving down Palafox Street and having people stop on the sidewalks to take photos, or pulling up next to people at stoplights and having the cars next to them roll down their windows to ask questions and laugh. The boat car makes people happy — and that's what makes Gerry and Karen happy, too.

""One time we pulled in by the beach ball (water tower) here on Pensacola Beach,"" Gerry says. ""And seven Marines came up to me and said, 'You just made our whole vacation.' You can't put a price on reactions like that.""

In the Know: Self-storage businesses being built 'like Dollar Generals' in Lee County,"We sure have a lot of stuff.

Boxes of stuff in the garage. Boxes of stuff in storage sheds.

Up north, people have more places to store stuff than people down south: Basement space for boxes. Attic space for more.

In my den, I have drawers full of files, a closet full of newspaper clips and bookshelves laden with books I haven't read in years but do not dare throw or give away.

In Lee County, to where more than 16,000 people moved from 2017 to 2018, there are no below-ground basements. Few homes have attic storage space either. Some newer housing developments have codes that prevent storage sheds.

With our population inflating, first past 500,000, then toward 750,000 and onward to a million, many just don’t have room for stuff.

Why throw or give stuff away? We are Americans. Until death do we part with our stuff.

With that mantra in mind, more and more self-storage units are being constructed. And they are going up in prominent, visible real estate locations.

“The secret sauce in self-storage is to find locations where the average home is older than you would think,” said Gary Tasman, founder of the Fort Myers real estate firm, Cushman and Wakefield. His firm produced a 19-page report, all about self-storage.

It concluded: in addition to the area’s newcomers, we have young millennials renting apartments without enough storage space. And we have retiring Baby Boomers – about 10,000 turn 65 every day – who are downsizing but maybe can’t quite get rid of family heirlooms because their children and grandchildren don’t have the space for them. Another conclusion: self-storage facilities are recession proof.

“Downsizing, death, divorce and dislocation.” Those were four factors that play into the rise of self-storage businesses, Tasman’s report said.

There are 300,000 items in the average American home, and we spend $1.2 trillion per year on non-essential goods, the L.A. Times reported.

“In a world of excessive consumption and unnecessary accumulation, minimalism continues to contribute to the rapid growth of self-storage areas,” Tasman’s report concluded.

That’s irony, because there’s nothing minimalist about clearing your house of clutter, only to pay somebody $30-$120 or more a month to store it off U.S. 41, State Road 80, Skyline Boulevard or Colonial Boulevard. All four of those roads in Cape Coral and Fort Myers have new self-storage businesses in the works.

For this week’s “In the Know” column, here’s an extended update on new places to store old stuff:

FROM FEDEX TO SPACEBOX: Construction on one of the largest commercial real estate deals in Fort Myers from 2018 hopefully will not wreak havoc on traffic at one of Lee County’s busiest throughways.

That will be up to Cape Coral and Fort Myers commuters and whether they slow down for a look-see at 2670 Colonial Blvd., former home of a FedEx distribution facility and future home of SpaceBox, a climate-controlled storage facility, across the street from a Super 8 Motel.

On the south side of the road and located just west of where the railroad tracks cross Colonial Boulevard and the northern entrance of John Yarbrough Linear Park, the 92,164-square-foot former FedEx building’s facelift began last month.

The 10 acres of land sold last June for $6.4 million.

Almost 60,000 cars per day in both directions pass by that location, according to the Florida Department of Transportation. With the Colonial Boulevard corridor exploding in development, this will be yet another place to store some stuff.

MODERN-DAY CAVES: Kevin Cloutier, a real estate agent, has booked the first eight of 10 units of the Caves in Cape Coral, to be built at 4329 SW 9th Ave., off Skyline Boulevard. The final two units are available for about $227,000. Construction is set to begin any day now.

These will be glorified man caves, more like a second home for storing more stuff than a storage shed. Think classic cars, pickup trucks and boats, not lawn mowers and boxes.

“We finally got the permit to begin building the caves,” Cloutier said. “There are two projects that we’ve got going on there. The one on the right is self-storage. And the Caves have finally been approved. We changed it from steel exterior walls to concrete block walls. That allowed us to have a sturdier building from a hurricane or anything like that. We just had it approved and have the permits in hand. We’re moving dirt as soon as possible.”

SKYLINE SELF STORAGE: Adjacent to the Caves, John Ringland, a Cape Coral developer, is building the 53,000-square-foot Skyline Self Storage. That address is 824 SW 42nd Terrace, at the corner with Skyline.

There will be 450 storage units of varying sizes.

“We have seven buildings going up,” Ringland said. “We are really going high-tech with ours with motion detectors and solar power. There are no key locks at our facility. Everything will be Bluetooth from your phone.

“We will have the largest solar fields in LCEC territory. It will provide at least 100 percent of the power for our storage facility.”

Cloutier predicted more storage units to sprout throughout Lee County.

“These things fill up as soon as you build them,” he said. “The self-storage things really do quite well. They’re putting them up like Dollar Generals. It’s like there’s one on every corner.”

BOAT STORAGE COMING SOON: The Matanzas Pass Bridge won’t be looking different soon, but the view on the way to Fort Myers Beach already has changed.

Gulf Star Marina, billed as “the star of boat storage,” is being constructed at 708 Fisherman’s Wharf, adjacent to the Fort Myers Beach Doc Ford’s restaurant.

The web site, gulfstarmarina.com, said the facility will have “smart technology,” enabling boat owners to get back on the water in seven minutes flat. The building, scheduled to be completed later this year, will be able to withstand hurricane-force winds of up to 200 miles per hour, the site said.

THE BABCOCK EFFECT: As Babcock Ranch fills in with residents, they will need places to store their stuff. That’s why developer Jim Magnus is building a self-storage unit near the corner of State Road 80 and State Road 31. That corner also will be home to a future RaceTrac gas station and a commercial development at the hard corner there.

RACING FOR MORE RACETRACS: Some of you are wondering what is being built at the corner of Winkler Road and Summerlin Boulevard, just north of HealthPark Medical Center.

It's another RaceTrac gas station. But this won’t be just any RaceTrac.

It’s the newest model, a prototype for future locations. So yes, even more RaceTracs are on the way.

This will be the franchise’s 20th Lee County location at yet another strategic, corner location with high visibility. Construction crews have been clearing the land for the station, not far from a 7-Eleven across Summerlin and just south of a Shell Station that fell into disrepair after the construction of the flyover from Gladiolus to Summerlin.

RaceTrac paid $1.8 million for the land at 15820 Winkler Road on Nov. 6, 2018. Construction is slated to be done between late fall and the end of the year, said Megan Shannon of RaceTrac. The inside will have about 5,500 square feet, about the same as the other Lee County stores but with new and more amenities.

“This store will be our latest store model,” Shannon said. “It will feature a Swirl World frozen dessert station with up to 10 flavors and 41 toppings and a large coffee station with enough counter space to create the perfect cup of freshly ground, freshly brewed, on-demand coffee. Our newer stores have a more shoppable layout, free Wi-Fi and more lighting in the store and parking lot to deliver a better guest experience.”

A Texas man went fishing on the Brazos River. He caught a prehistoric human bone,"While fishing along the Brazos River in Texas, Scott Fuller spotted a floating piece of history: an 800-year-old human femur bone.

Fuller found the bone floating about a foot from the river's shore, local station WFAA reported, and thought it was a clue to a murder mystery. But scientific analysis determined the bone dates to between 1286 and 1398 A.D.

""I'm still wrapping my mind around it,"" Fuller told WFAA.

A forensic anthropologist at the Tarrant County Medical Examiner’s Office realized the bone was ancient, The Weatherford Democrat reported, then took a sample to a lab in Florida.

Carbon-14 dating, which estimates the age of carbon-based materials from living organisms, determined the bone's age range with a 95.4% accuracy.

Parker County Senior Investigator Bryan Wright and Sheriff Larry Fowler both said they believe the bone belonged to a Native American, the Democrat reported.

“We believe it was the Caddo Indians that were in this area hundreds of years ago,” Fowler told the Democrat. “I’m the keeper of the bone until it’s disposed of properly — properly. We can’t just throw it away and I shall treat the Indian bone with dignity and respect.”

Water project dig: Ancient skeletons that may have been part of 'human sacrifice' found

Levallois cores: Prehistoric 'Swiss Army knife' discovered in China

Fowler told WFAA he did not know of any ancient bone discoveries in the county dating that far back.

The bone is currently being stored in an anthropological locker at the medical examiner's office, the Democrat reported.

A week after Fueller found the femur bone in March, he spotted a human rib bone floating in the same place. But it rained after he called the medical examiner, WFAA reported, and the bone disappeared under the water.

Ancestors of the Caddo Nation were farmers whose distinctive culture dates to 900 A.D., according to the Caddo Nation's website. They lived in what is now Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma.

Local reports did not indicate whether Texas officials contacted the Caddo Nation about the discovery.

Man on lawnmower arrested for DUI after crashing into police cruiser,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

HAINES CITY, Fla. (WFLA) - A Haines City man is facing a DUI charge after police say he hit a cruiser while driving a lawnmower then accused cops of poisoning him and putting cocaine in his system.

The crash happened around 7 p.m. Saturday outside Rodriguez Fashion on US-17/92 North. An officer was inside when he heard a loud noise come from outside where his cruiser was parked.

When the officer walked outside, he says he spotted 68-year-old Gary Wayne Anderson on a lawnmower with an attached trailer. The officer also noted there was minor damage to the back bumper on his police car.

According to police, Anderson admitted he was drunk and hit the cruiser but claimed he didn't cause any damage. Officers say he couldn't complete field sobriety tests and noted that his demeanor ""ranged from laughing to aggressive.""

After he was taken to the police department, Anderson asked to be taken to a hospital because he claimed he had been poisoned by police, officers say.

Anderson was taken to Heart of Florida Regional Medical Center, where he provided a breathalyzer sample. According to police, his blood-alcohol content was .241 - more than three times the legal limit.

Officers say Anderson also had cocaine in his system. Anderson accused police of putting the cocaine in his system, ""while directing profane language and racial slurs at the officer,"" police say.

""I'm proud of the professional demeanor our officers showed when dealing with this heavily-intoxicated, belligerent offender,"" Chief Jim Elensky said.

According to a police department spokesman, Anderson's driver's license has been suspended since March 1978. He also has two prior DUI convictions.

""It's never a good idea to get behind the wheel drunk, even if that wheel is to a Craftsman, Massey Ferguson or John Deere,"" Chief Elensky said.",http://www.nbc4i.com/news/u-s-world/man-on-lawnmower-arrested-for-dui-after-crashing-into-police-cruiser/1983474949,2019-05-06T18:24:29Z,WCMH,"3165 Olentangy River Rd, Columbus, OH 43202, USA"
"FDA OKs smokeless cigarette sales, but can they help you quit?","Advertisement FDA OKs smokeless cigarette sales, but can they help you quit? New device approved by Food and Drug Administration Share Shares Copy Link Copy

Quitting smoking isn’t easy. Some doctors hoped vaping would transition people off cigarettes, but now there are questions about what vaping does to your health, too. Philip Morris International was recently approved to sell a pen-like device called IQOS that’s halfway between a vape pen and a cigarette. It’s been sold in other countries for about three years, and the FDA agreed to permit the sale of it in the U.S. last week. It’s considered a “heat not burn” device, and it’s kind of like a vape pen but uses tobacco instead of liquid nicotine. The FDA acknowledges that “the products produce fewer or lower levels of some toxins than combustible cigarettes.” That’s good, since when burned, cigarettes create more than 7,000 chemicals and the FDA agrees that IQOS delivers less carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and acrolein. It can’t yet be marketed as a “safer” cigarette, the FDA says, and there’s also no evidence it helps users quit actual cigarettes, points out Dr. Michael Roizen, chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic. So why would you use it? In The New York Times, André Calantzopoulos, the chief executive officer of Philip Morris International, says “the IQOS offers a smoke-free alternative to continued smoking.” Better ways to quitDon’t let that be good enough for you. “There are many proven ways to quit smoking,” Roizen said. Nicotine replacement patches and prescription medications like Chantix and Zyban have track records, he says, adding that peer support is essential, too. In the Cleveland Clinic Wellness smoking cessation program, they’ve seen a 63 percent success rate in quitting among 5,000 people using a combination of nicotine patches, prescription medications and coaching. What many people who want to quit overlook is that “you have to replace the habit of smoking with something else, like activity,” Roizen said. He recommends creating a quit plan, as does the National Cancer Institute, wherein you choose a date for quitting. Then, Roizen recommends racking up success by doing your smoking replacement every day until you quit. Suppose your smoking replacement is push-ups. Practice doing them every day before you give up cigarettes, so you go into the process with a track record of success. Research has found even Twitter and milk can help you out, too. If you don’t have a coach or buddy in the game with you, the National Cancer Institute has two free apps — quitSTART and QuitGuide — that promise support and motivation along your way to kicking the habit.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/smokeless-cigarette-iqos/27376063,2019-05-06T18:06:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA"

"Myths about lovebugs are harder to kill than the pesky insect that plagues Floridians, visitors","CLOSE Lovebugs, those pesky poor fliers are a nuisance but thankfully they are short-lived. Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

No, they aren't some genetic experiment gone wrong, just the usual swarm that splatters its way across Florida twice a year.

They don't belong here, though, and are surely here to stay.

Lovebugs live just three or four days, packing plenty of annoyance into short lifespans. They madden motorists as they splatter their guts on windshields and hoods.

They gross out joggers and cyclists as they land in their mouths. And they stress out the chronically clean as they speckle otherwise immaculate white walls of beachside resorts and condos almost completely black. Someone's got to clean them up.

More: Cool front moving across state could bring torrential rain, strong wind gusts to Treasure Coast

There's nothing illusory about their gooey impacts. Those are as clear as day on our windshields. But many myths persist about the lowly lovebug: Do they bite or spread disease. How did they get here? Are the white splotches they leave behind acidic?

Norman Leppla, an entomologist at University of Florida, has spent years debunking the multitude of lovebug myths, in his presentations for UF's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS).

For starters, he says, lovebugs weren't genetically modified and then released by UF scientists as a way to rid the state of mosquitoes, Leppla assures. They don't even eat mosquitoes.

They are an invasive species, however. They emigrated into Texas and Louisiana from Central America in the 1920s, Leppla says. They didn't show up in Florida until the 1940s, and Brevard until the 1970s, when they were much worse than now. Their spread in Florida may have been helped along by prevailing winds, vehicle traffic, sod transport, expansion of pastures, and increased habitat along highways, UF researchers suspect.

More: Consistent rain increases mosquitoes, gator, love bug sightings on Treasure Coast

""They came to Florida just after World War II, we think pretty much by themselves, across the Yucatan,"" Leppla says in an IFAS educational video about the bug. ""And they radiated across to Florida, and we had a lot more of them then than we do now.""

They're always around, but the infamous lovebug ""swarms"" only happen for a few weeks a year, typically in May and September, entomologists say.

Lovebugs are attracted to irradiated exhaust fumes from cars, lawnmowers and other engines, and to heat.

Males swarm over places where they know females will soon emerge. The females fly into swarms of the hovering males, typically from 8 to 10 a.m. and from 4 to 5 p.m. That's rush hour for us. So the timing can plaster lovebug carcasses all over cars as rush-hour traffic passes bug-packed Brazilian pepper trees and other roadside vegetation where the bugs live along interstates and major thoroughfares.

Up to eight males compete for each female. The lovebug ""flights"" usually only happen during daylight and temperatures above 68 degrees Fahrenheit. At night, they rest on low-growing plants.

More: Texas man recovering after shark bite in Florida

Lovebugs don't sting or bite. They feed on plant nectar, especially sweet clover, goldenrod and Brazilian pepper.

""Lovebugs have no risk to human health whatsoever,"" Leppla assures in the IFAS video. ""They don't transmit diseases ... They couldn't bite you if they wanted to.""

The white splatter they leave on the cars is their eggs, Leppla says. ""They aren't acid and they aren't basic. They're fairly neutral. So what causes the problem is leaving those on the car, until the sun and the heat, and perhaps microorganisms cause them to be damaging.""

Over several days, bacteria increases the acidity and etches the paint. So IFAS recommends soaking the surface with water for about five minutes, then scrubbing within 15 to 20 minutes to remove most of the lovebugs without harm to automobile paint.

There really isn't any way to control lovebugs, scientists warn. Pesticides don't help. The bugs fly up into the breeze to avoid it. Few predators eat them.

Biologists say that now that lovebugs are here, they do serve an important ecological role in Florida. Lovebug larvae convert plant material into organic components that growing plants recycle for food, according to a University of Florida report.

More: 10-foot great white shark pings off Melbourne coast

Lovebugs add to the litany of Florida creatures that herald what's to come, biologist say.

""They tell us when it's going to be summer,"" Leppla said. ""They tell us when it's going to be fall, when they come out in September. So they're kind of an organism that brings in the seasons.""

"Man rammed patrol vehicle in bid to escape, Indian River deputies say","CLOSE If you see a crime being committed, leave anonymous tips with Treasure Coast Crime Stoppers. GINNY BEAGAN/TCPALM April 2019 Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — A Port St. Lucie man tried to escape arrest Sunday by striking a Sheriff's Office patrol cruiser and leading deputies on a chase in a stolen car, an arrest report said.

Dylan Lawson, 22, is charged with aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer, grand theft auto, fleeing and eluding after a crash involving property damage, misdemeanor domestic battery and resisting arrest without violence.

He was being held Monday at the Indian River County Jail on $19,000 bail.

Indian River County deputies were searching for Lawson about 3 p.m. after a caller reported he had punched her in the head while he was riding as a passenger in her 2011 Chevrolet Malibu, the report said.

Lawson drove off with her car after she fled to a nearby residence in the 9200 block of 86th Street, south of Sebastian, deputies said.

When they found and approached Lawson in the Publix parking lot on Sebastian Boulevard, he threw his car in reverse and rammed a deputy's patrol cruiser before fleeing the scene, the report said.

Lawson ""commenced to drive around Indian River County"" for nearly an hour, ""evading numerous deputies at various speeds,"" the report stated.

Deputies contacted Lawson by phone after disabling two of his tires with spike strips and convinced him to return to the home on 86th Street. He was detained about 4:45 p.m. after a brief standoff, the report said.

Sheriff's Office spokesman Maj. Eric Flowers said the deputy in the struck vehicle was ""a little sore"" Monday but was not otherwise injured.

Former Perry plant worker files discrimination lawsuit,"A former employee of a Taylor County weapons manufacturing plant has made good on filing a civil lawsuit claiming discrimination and retaliation from a higher-up.

Jackie Hendry filed a complaint with the Florida Commission on Human Relations last year but since the organization has not completed its investigation, the civil lawsuit was filed April 16 in Third Circuit Court.

Hendry claims she was terminated in retaliation for objecting to repeated sexual harassment by her supervisor at AMTEC Less-Lethal Inc., where two people were killed in an explosion.

Hendry told AMTEC’s former president about the sexual advances and advised that the building was unsafe.

Hendry said her supervisor, Vernon Wakefield, the plant’s quality control manager and head of safety, started the harassment by asking if she would have sex with a black man. She asked him to stop, but she said Wakefield created a “sexually charged work environment” that led to her being ostracized among other employees.

She was fired Aug. 10, the same day Wakefield was promoted to director of operations.

Hendry reported that another employee, manager Dina Parton, was not using antistatic scoops used to insert explosive flash powder into devices manufactured by the company.

She also reported that the manager was storing too many pounds of flash powder inside the building, beyond what was allowed by regulation, and was placing grenades on trash bags that were not anti-static and slamming them against a table to see if powder would leak.

AMTEC faced sanctions and fines last month from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

The company was purchased by PACEM Defense in October, a month after the fatal explosion. Its president, Mike Quesenberry, said on Friday that his company is not responsible for the fines levied against AMTEC.

Hendry warned that an explosion like the one that killed Christina L. Patterson and Thomas Fowler Jr. was imminent.

Man charged with driving drunk on lawnmower,"HAINES CITY — County music star George Jones would have been proud.

On Saturday, a Haines City man was arrested on drunk driving charges after police said he crashed a lawn mower into a police cruiser.

Gary Wayne Anderson, 68, crashed into the cruiser outside Rodriguez Fashion, 1100 U.S. 17/92 N., about 7 p.m. while a Haines City police officer was away from the car, police reported.

Anderson acknowledged hitting the cruiser, but offered an excuse of being drunk and said there was no damage to the car, according to a release from the HCPD.

He failed the field sobriety test and was taken to the Haines City Police Department. At the department, Anderson told officers he had been poisoned by police and demanded to be taken to a hospital, the HCPD said.

At Heart of Florida Regional Medical Center, his blood-alcohol level was .241 — more than three times the legal limit of 0.08%, according to Mike Ferguson, a spokesman for the HCPD. Cocaine was also found in Anderson's system, police reported.

Anderson's mood shifted from laughing to aggressive, and at one point he directed racial slurs at an officer, police reported.

Anderson's driver's license has been suspended since 1978. He has two prior drunk driving convictions.

The crash caused minor damage to the rear bumper of the cruiser. Anderson's lawn mower and a trailer hooked to the mower were towed. A cooler could be seen in the trailer from a picture provided by police.

The most famous alcohol-related lawn mower incident involved country music icon George Jones.

In country singer Tammy Wynette’s 1979 autobiography, she wrote that she awoke at 1 a.m. to find her husband, Jones, gone from their South Lakeland home.

Jones had driven a lawn mower 10 miles down a main highway to the nearest bar, she said.

SunFest is the biggest musical festival in town. Rain or shine, the festival goes on according to SunFest website. “SunFest does not refund or exchange tickets due to inclement weather.” Downtown on Clematis Street, live performances rocked out the four stages and the streets were filled with vendors and of course dancing. However, there was a surprise act—stormy weather. Not everyone was prepared, but Laurie Jones said the acts made it all worth it. “Look at me I am soaking wet. Still good it’s only once a year,” Jones said. Jones like most festival goers, came without an umbrella or poncho. Some acts were drier than others. “Thursday night with One Republic it rained. Friday Earth Wind and Fire was awesome and that was dry and yesterday it was totally dry,” Jones said. Keith Urban posted on Facebook that the Miami airport was closed and it was preventing him on getting to play at SunFest.He was scheduled to play at 7:30 pm. SunFest confirmed that due to the weather causing unsafe conditions on the JetBlue Stage the Tears For Fears show was canceled.On a less sweeter note Thomas the Ice Cream Man has been a vendor at Sunfest for the last decade. His mini ice cream parlor on wheels serves soft old fashioned ice cream “It’s a product that people want to have when they are having a good time.

Jeb Bush's education plan comes full circle | Guestview,"It was appropriate that legislators invited former Gov. Jeb Bush to visit the House this week as the big tuition-voucher bill was given final approval.

It was Bush who, a little more than 20 years ago, began Florida’s education evolution – some would call it a revolution — culminating in the near party-line vote of 76-39 for the package that will allow state tax money to be used for families to send their kids to private schools. The first time he ran for governor, Bush visited public schools all over the state in 1994 and said he was going to work for major, fundamental change in education.

Whatever else you might think of Bush, he was an idea man. He seemed to have little patience with “but we’ve always done it this way.”



He lost that year but won four years later. Republicans controlled both chambers of the Legislature by then, and Bush won legislative approval of his initial voucher plan – dubbed the “opportunity scholarship program” – only to have it stricken by the Florida Supreme Court.

A few important things have changed since then, but the fundamentals remain the same. Republicans call it “choice” – an idea Democrats like in another context, but not regarding schools – and Democrats call it wholesale robbery of the public schools. A smattering of Democrats voted for the voucher bill in the House, but the idea of providing $130 million in tax money to help low- and moderate-income families pay tuition was too much for most of their party.

That’s hardly surprising. The Florida Education Association, the state’s big teacher union, has the most sought-after political endorsement in Democratic primaries. The National Rifle Association’s approach to gun control is a model of open-minded moderation and willingness to hear both sides, compared to the FEA’s attitude toward tuition vouchers.

Parents seem to like them, though. There’s a waiting list of more than 13,000 kids who’d like to switch schools under the existing voucher program, which is funded through corporate tax credits rather than direct support from the treasury. The “Family Empowerment Scholarship Program,” as the just-passed bill is titled, raises the eligibility ceiling from $66,950 to $77,250 for a family of four seeking tuition assistance.

The Florida Supreme Court will probably like it better, too. No justices who voted on the 5-2 ruling striking down Bush’s “opportunity scholarship plan” in 2006 are still on the bench. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who will undoubtedly sign the new bill (SB 7070), appointed three new justices early this year, replacing three who’d voted against the Bush plan (among other conservative causes over the years).

The political outcome has been inevitable since last November. If Democrat Andrew Gillum had beaten DeSantis, he’d have appointed different Supreme Court justices. He’d also veto the vouchers, if the GOP-run Legislature even bothered passing the bill.

There’s a good argument that competition always improves efficiency and outcomes, even in schools. That would be valid, if the competition was fair – if private schools were held to the same standards as public schools. If they were graded A through F like public schools. If they had to take everybody, even the most troubled kids, like the public schools.

Private schools can also do a lousy job. The Orlando Sentinel did a series in 2017, “Schools Without Rules,” documenting how some private academies hired teachers without college degrees – even with criminal records – and falsified health and safety inspections. The privateers exist primarily to make money, while the public schools exist to survive annual mandates and meddling from Tallahassee.

If the kids get an education in there somehow, that’s nice too.

Some time this month, DeSantis ought to invite Bush back to the Capitol for the formal signing of the new voucher law, or take the bill down to Miami and set up a ceremony somewhere historically significant to the governor who started it all. Then he could give him the pen.

Employment decision on Marco Island 'Brady cop' may be coming soon,"CLOSE This is a six-month review of the most-read crime stories in Collier County on naplesnews.com from September 2018 to February 2019. Vonna Keomanyvong, vonna.keomanyvong@naplesnews.com; 239-213-5380

A discredited Marco Island police officer's employment status has remained in limbo for more than two months, but a decision on whether he loses or retains his job may be coming soon.

City Manager David Harden said Thursday that a decision on Officer Tige Thompson, who was placed on paid administrative leave Feb. 19, may be finalized this week after the city chose to evaluate whether he could fulfill his duties as an officer despite not being able to testify at criminal trials.

""I have been waiting on a draft letter from our attorneys,"" Harden said. ""Next week, I should be able to review a draft letter and hopefully get it finalized.""

Thompson has remained a Marco Island police officer for years despite the state attorney's office conferring the do-not-subpoena status. Sometimes known as a Brady List, it identifies officers with a history of dishonesty or who can be impeached as a witness.

More: Termination recommended for Marco Island 'Brady cop' due to inability to perform duties

More: Marco Island 'Brady cop' placed on administrative leave, job in jeopardy

More: State attorney's office declined to prosecute multiple Marco Island criminal charges last month due to 'Brady cop'

The Brady List moniker was created as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in the 1963 case Brady v. Maryland, which established that prosecutors were required to turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense, including any evidence that could impeach a witness.

The state attorney's office included Thompson on the do-not-subpoena list after he was found to have given inconsistent and untruthful testimony as part of a 2011 DUI case where it eventually had to drop the charges. The state attorney's office also cited Thompson's previous termination from the Collier County Sheriff's Office as part of its rationale.

Thompson remained with the department and was reassigned to investigations following the issuance of a letter in 2013 from the state attorney's office, which stated that Thompson would not be used as a witness for the prosecution in any criminal matters.

After a follow-up letter was sent to the police department in 2015, Police Chief Al Schettino returned Thompson to patrol due to the belief that Thompson would tarnish all cases he investigated.

In June 2015, an internal affairs investigation was launched into Thompson's previous actions and determined that he was violated multiple police policies. However, because the investigation spanned more than 180 days, the department could not impose any discipline due to state law.

A copy of the internal affairs report was forwarded to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which launched its own perjury investigation. Due to the age of the case and evidentiary issues, FDLE no caused the case.

Since he was returned to patrol in 2015, records show Thompson was involved in 12 felony, 30 misdemeanor and 67 criminal traffic cases, none of which have gone to trial.

Thompson's actions warranted further scrutiny recently when a few higher profile arrests he was involved with resulted in the state attorney's office choosing not to prosecute the cases. This included one case where a Marco Island man barricaded himself in his home with a cache of weapons, which prompted SWAT to respond to the scene.

After Thompson was placed on administrative leave, Harden instructed Schettino to assess whether Thompson was able to perform the duties of the job given his inclusion on the Brady List.

In a March 18 memo to Thompson, Schettino recommended his disqualification, citing the ability to testify as an integral part of his duties.

""The Department has no control over the SAO's Brady List, but the SAO's determination has nevertheless fatally undermined your ability to perform your job,"" Schettino wrote. ""The reason being, the SAO has stated that you cannot testify. By extension, an officer who cannot be counted on to testify also cannot be counted on to make arrests, investigate cases, or carry out any other police functions that might lead to being a witness.""

While a pre-determination hearing was held on March 26, the city has held off on making a final decision on Thompson until now.

As of May 3, it would mean Thompson has been on paid leave for 74 days and counting.

From the date he was placed on the leave until now, Thompson has earned more than $13,000 in pay, according to payroll records.

Records show Thompson has been employed with the Marco Island Police Department since Nov. 13, 2006.

Florida State lands Ole Miss grad transfer Dominik Olejniczak,"Ole Miss graduate transfer Dominik Olejniczak will finish his career at Florida State. (Photo: Instagram: Dominik Olejniczak)

The Florida State men's basketball team landed some much-needed big-man depth with the addition of Ole Miss graduate transfer center Dominik Olejniczak.

Olejniczak announced Sunday on his Instagram that he will be finishing his career with the Seminoles after he visited FSU earlier this week.

""Last college ride. Let's make it a good one,"" Olejniczak captioned the photo of him wearing an FSU jersey.

Stadium's Jeff Goodman ranked Olejniczak as the 39th-best available transfer this offseason in the Top 100 ranking he released in April.

The 7-foot-0, 260-pound center played the last two seasons for the Rebels after he began his career at Drake. In the 2018-19 season, he averaged 5.3 points and 3.0 rebounds over 18.3 points per game.

Olejniczak will make an instant impact for the Seminoles after they lost three big men -- center Christ Koumadje and forwards Phil Cofer and Mfiondu Kabengele -- off last year's team.

Along with Olejniczak, FSU will bring in two freshmen bigs in four-star Balsa Koprivica and three-star Naheem McLeod.",http://rssfeeds.tallahassee.com/~/601636302/0/tallahassee/home~Florida-State-lands-Ole-Miss-grad-transfer-Dominik-Olejniczak/,2019-05-05T13:54:17Z,Tallahassee Democrat,"277 N Magnolia Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32301, USA"

Man bit by a shark after he fell off a fishing boat in Florida,"CLOSE Paul Kelly said the worst part of the day was losing the tarpon he was trying to reel in. Fort Myers News-Press

FORT MYERS, Fla. – The ""worst part"" of a Texas man's fishing trip to Florida wasn't when he got bit by a shark.

It's when he lost the tarpon he was trying to reel in.

Speaking from a hospital Saturday, Paul Kelly, 72, said it was still a good trip overall.

""We lost the fish of course,"" Kelly said. ""That was the worst part.""

Kelly said he was on a six-hour fishing trip with a good friend and a boat captain in Boca Grande Pass on Wednesday.

Near the end of the trip, he and his friend hooked sizable tarpons, he said.

Kelly said he was trying to work in a 150-pound tarpon when he slipped and was yanked into the water by the fish.

While he was underwater, Kelly said he felt something hit his leg. He didn't realize at the time that it was a shark nibbling on him.

The captain pulled him to the boat with a fishing rod, and his buddy hoisted him into the boat by his belt.

Once he was in the boat, the captain told him a shark had bitten him and that it appeared to be an 8- to 10-foot bull shark, Kelly said.

That's when he noticed a gash around his left knee and calf, he said.

The men acted quickly, wrapping a belt around his left thigh to stop the bleeding as they raced to shore. Paramedics swarmed him, dressing his leg and securing a tourniquet. Kelly was airlifted to a trauma center.

Surgeons stitched him up, and he had surgery on a torn tendon in his knee the next day.

The Vietnam veteran said he barely felt pain through the whole incident or post surgery.

""You do the best with what you get,"" he said.

Doctors told him he should be able to leave the hospital in the next few days. He and his wife hope to return to Texas on Monday.

The surgeon who treated Kelly, Robert L'Connor, said he's seen alligator bites, but never a shark bite.

""They aren't that frequent to be honest with you,"" L'Connor said. ""It's something everybody is concerned with when they get into the water, but it's the first one I've seen in 10 years.""

"Trump’s rambling, deceptive Q&A with reporters, annotated","President Trump was in rare form Thursday. In a lengthy Q&A with reporters after an event on combating surprise medical bills, Trump took a series of questions on the Mueller report, on a Senate GOP chairman’s subpoena of his son Donald Trump Jr., on North Korea and on a host of other topics.

Many of the claims have been fact-checked as false — and some of them were offered in quick succession. Others were brand new and raised questions about what Trump has been doing behind the scenes.

Below is the transcript, with annotations and analysis/fact-checking in yellow.

QUESTION:

Mr. President, on the North Korean missiles, what message do you take from that (INAUDIBLE)?

TRUMP:

Well, we're looking at it very seriously right now. They were smaller missiles, short-range missiles. Nobody's happy about it. But we're taking a good look, and we'll see, we'll see. The relationship continues, but we'll see what happens. I know they want to negotiate. They're talking about negotiating, but I don't think they're ready to negotiate because we have to either do--it's very much like China. The vice-premier is coming here today. We were getting very close to a deal, then they started to renegotiate the deal. We can't have that. We can't have that. So our country can take in $120 billion a year in tariffs, paid for mostly by China, by the way, not by a lot of people try and steer it in a different direction. It's really paid for--ultimately it's paid for by--largely by china. And businesses will pour back into our country, so instead of making the products, it'll be the old-fashioned way, the way we used to do it. we made our own product. And I think things are going along pretty well there, but a large group delegation headed by one of the most respective respected men and highest officials of China will be coming in today.

They start at 5:00 and they'll see what they can do, but our alternative is--is an excellent one. It's an alternative I've spoken about for years. We'll take in well over $100 billion a year. We never took in $0.10 from China, not $0.10. And it will be a--I think it'll be a very strong day, frankly. But we'll see. We'll see. It was their idea to come back.

QUESTION:

Do you have plans to talk to President Xi, or no, not yet?

TRUMP:

Well, he just wrote me a beautiful letter. I just received it and out probably speak to him by phone. But look, we have two great alternatives. Our country is doing fantastically well. Our numbers at 3.2. Don't forget, 3.2--the first quarter is always by far the worst quarter, or at least almost always. You look back over the years, first quarters always weak, and we had 3.2 GDP.

Our unemployment numbers are the best in the history of our country, and we are doing well. And our companies are really doing well. Even in Ohio, the great state of Ohio yesterday, General Motors at my very strong urging, to put it mildly, very strong urging, I wasn't even nice about it, but I appreciate what they did, they sold the--the beautiful plant, Lordstown. They sold that beautiful plant to a very, very good company that's going to make electric trucks.

And that worked because that was the only thing they could say about our whole economy. Lordstown. They kept saying Lordstown, Lordstown. And when you had all of these great companies spending billions and billions of dollars coming into our country, they couldn't talk about it. They'd only mentioned the one plant that was a GM plant from a very long time ago. And now we have a great company going in going to make electric trucks. Very appropriate. Very interesting idea, actually. Electric trucks. Yes, please.

QUESTION:

Will you allow Robert Muller to testify to Congress?

TRUMP:

Well, I'm going to leave that up to our very great attorney general, and he'll make a decision on that. But I will say this, look, the Mueller report came out, it was done at I got some hearing numbers now close to $40 million with 17 or 18 very angry Democrats who hated Donald Trump and also everything that they could possibly have at their disposal.

There was nobody that was in the history of our country more transparent than me. I said give them every document, give them every person. Let the White House counsel testify. I think he testified for 30 hours. I guess they must have asked him the same question because there wasn't very much to testify about. But I said let him testify and let him--keep him as long as you want.

Actually, when I heard 30 hours, I said that's a long time, but I let him testify. I didn't have to. I have presidential privilege. I could've stopped everything. I didn't have to give them a document. I gave them 1.5 million documents. I gave them White House counsel, I gave them over other law--anybody you want, you can talk to. At the end of the testimony, no collusion and essentially, no obstruction.

Of course, a lot of people say how can you obstruct when there was no crime, when there was no collusion, how can you possibly obstruct? I'll tell you, but it's worse than that. It's not only was there no crime, but the crime was committed on the other side. So we are protecting against the crime committed on the other side. So after spending all of that money, all of that time, two years, they come up with a report.

And Bob Mueller is no friend of mine. I had conflicts with him. We had a business dispute, we had somebody that is in love with James Comey. We like James Comey. They were very good friends, supposedly best friends. May be not, but supposedly best friends. You look at the picture file and you see hundreds of pictures of him and Comey. And with all of that and other things, he wanted the FBI job. I don't know if anybody knows that, but as you know, he was considered for the FBI job, wanted it, and the day after he didn't get it, he became the special counsel. That's a conflict. And we had other things, but those are tremendous conflicts.

Listen to this. Your judge, call him a judge, is a--has a business dispute with me. Your judge has a fantastic relationship with James Comey. Well, he's a part of this. He lied to Congress, he leaked--he's a liar, a leaker. And your judge has a situation where he wanted to become the FBI director. We chose Director Wray instead and told him I'm sorry. That's--those are tremendous conflicts. Those are tremendous conflicts.

And then he puts on his staff almost all Democrats, many of whom contributed to Hillary Clinton. None of them contributed to me. That I can tell you. And it started out at 13 and it went to 18. And these were angry Democrats. These were people that went to her, in one case, went to her what was supposed to be a party and turned out to be a funeral on election evening and was going wild. He was so angry. And this man now is judging me. You had other people made big contributions to Hillary Clinton's campaign. They were angry Democrats in I think almost all cases.

One of the people worked on the Clinton foundation as just about the top person at the Clinton foundation. With all of this, they came back no collusion. There is nobody in this room including you if they were--that's you, John. If they looked at you with $40 million, 18 angry people that hated you and all of the other things I mentioned, they'll find something. I don't know, maybe John, not. Go ahead, finish up.

QUESTION:

But Mr. Mueller is also friends with Mr. Barr. And as you're aware, Mr. Barr told lawmakers that he didn't have a problem with Mr.--with Mr. Mueller testifying.

TRUMP:

I'm going to leave that up to the attorney general as to whether or not--I think to me it looks like a redo. Here's what happened, the report comes back, it's perfect. It's beautiful. There's no collusion. Nobody even talks about collusion. You know, I haven't heard the word Russia in a long time. There's no more talk about Russia. What happened to Russia? The Russian witchhunt--they don't talk because it was so on collusion, which by the way, is by far--that's the big deal because it was all about Russia. So I haven't heard the word Russia. They don't use the word Russia anymore.

So there's no crime. There know what never was a crime. It was a hoax. It was a witchhunt. So this comes back, and it comes back totally exonerating Donald Trump and a lot of other people. This was a terrible thing that happened to our country.

Now I'll tell you what they are asking. They are asking about how did this whole thing started. That's what people want to know, and I want to tell you, I had a--an event last night. A lot of you were there. Thousands and thousands of people standing in a field. They've never seen anything like it, meaning even the press. But it's always that way. We never had an empty seat. Thousands of people last night. You know what they want to know? How did this whole thing start. It's going to be hard for them to answer that one. Yeah, please.

QUESTION:

Mr. President, are you satisfied with the advice you received from John Bolton?

TRUMP:

Yeah, John is very good. John is a--he has strong views on things, but that's okay. I actually temper John, which is pretty amazing, isn't it?

(LAUGHTER)

Nobody thought that was going to happen. I'm the one that tempers him. But that's okay. I have different sites. I mean, I have John Bolton and I have other people that are a little more dovish than him. And ultimately, I make the decision. No, I get--I like John, I get very good advice from John. John?

QUESTION:

Mr. President, as you saw, the Senate Intelligent Committee has subpoenaed Don Junior. That's the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Community. What you make of that?

TRUMP:

Well, I was very surprised. I saw Richard Burr (SP) saying there was no collusion to or three weeks ago. He went outside and 70 asked him. No, there's no collusion. We found no collision. But I was very surprised to see my son. My son is a very good person, works very hard. The last thing he needs is Washington DC. I think he'd rather not ever be involved.

Remember he said to me a long time ago when I was thinking about running dad, if I can help, let me know. It's not my expertise, it's not something I really like, but whatever I can do, you're my father. Whatever I can do. He's now testified for 20 hours or something. A massive amount of time. The Mueller report came out. That's the Bible. The Mueller report came out and they said he did nothing wrong. The only thing is, it's oppo (SP) research. If he did wrong, then everybody standing with me probably, except for John, and Lamar, I think Lamar is pretty--I'll tell you, did you ever do oppo research on an opponent? I don't think so, Lamar, right?

UNKNOWN:

(OFF-MIC)

(LAUGHTER)

TRUMP:

And I know John Barrasso never did opposition research because he said a he's a fine, fine man. But I would say 99 percent of the rest of the folks are--so they didn't--but what they didn't discuss is this woman that came in who I watched her in the Today Show when it all started. Oh, I'm just an innocent. Well, nobody even knows. Although the halls of Congress know her very well because for years she's walked around all over the Congress.

She came in and she left supposedly GPS Fusion, goes and meets for short period of time with my son and some other people, they talk about a subject as very well, you know, advertised and put out, which is nothing, it was a nothing meeting. In fact, Jared left. He said, ""Get me out of this meeting. This is a waste of time."" She then went back to GPS Fusion. They were the ones that wrote the phony dossier. Why was she going to GPS Fusion? Why did she go back?

Then I heard that Don, for a year, made three phone calls with an unmarked number. They called it unmarked. And this was a tremendous event, because they all knew--the fake news, they all--no, you were fair on that, John. But they all knew that these phone calls, these--these tremendous phone calls before the meeting and after the meeting--there were, I believe, three, right? They all knew that it had to be to his father. Unmarked, it's perfect.

So, he reported about the meeting and then reported what happened at the meeting, except after looking and spending a tremendous amount of time and money, they were able to go back years and find out who made the calls. One was a local real estate developer. The other was a great person from NASCAR. He took two of them, and a friend of Don's.

This went on for a year and a half. John, you heard all about the phone calls to obviously the father, where I knew--I never knew about the meeting. But the phone calls to the father turned out not to be the phone calls.

My son is a good person. My son testified for hours and hours. My son was totally exonerated by Mueller, who frankly does not like Donald Trump, me, this Donald Trump. And frankly, for my son, after being exonerated, to now get a subpoena to go again and speak again after close to 20 hours of telling everybody that would listen about a nothing meeting, yeah, I'm pretty surprised.

Please.

QUESTION:

Should he fight that subpoena?

TRUMP:

We'll see what happens. I'm just very surprised, I really am, by it.

Yeah?

QUESTION:

What did Iran do to prompt you to send an aircraft carrier to the--the region?

TRUMP:

Well, they were threatening, and we have information--

QUESTION:

--Is there a risk--is there a risk--

TRUMP:

--We have information that you don't want to know about. They were very threatening, and we just want to have--we have to have great security for this country and for a lot of other places.

QUESTION:

Is there a risk of military confrontation, sir?

TRUMP:

I guess you could say that always, right? Isn't it, I mean, you know, always? I don't want to say no, but hopefully that won't happen. We have one of the most powerful ships in the world that's loaded up, and we don't want to have to do anything.

But I'd like to see--with Iran, I'd like to see them call me. You know, John Kerry speaks to them a lot. John Kerry tells them not to call. That's a violation of the Logan Act. And frankly, he should be prosecuted on that. But my people don't want to do anything that's--only the Democrats do that kind of stuff you know? If it were the opposite way, they'd prosecute him under the Logan Act.

But John Kerry violated the Logan Act. He's talking to Iran and has been, has many meetings and many phone calls. And he's telling them what to do. That is a total violation of the Logan Act, because what they should be doing is--their economy is a mess ever since I took away the Iran deal. They have inflation that's the highest number I've ever heard. They are having riots every weekends and during the week even.

And what they should be doing is calling me up, sitting down. We can make a deal, fair deal. We just don't want them to have nuclear weapons, not too much to ask. And we would help put them back into great shape. They're in bad shape right now. I look forward to the day where we can actually help Iran. We're not looking to hurt Iran. I want them to be strong and great and have a great economy.

But there listening to John Kerry, whose violated a very important elements of what he's supposed to be doing. He violated the Logan Act, plain and simple. He shouldn't be doing that. But they should call, and if they do, we're open to talk to them. We have no secrets. And they can be very, very strong financially. They have great potential, very much like North Korea.

North Korea has tremendous potential economically. And I don't think he's going to blow that. I don't think so.

QUESTION:

Can I circle back to trade just for a second?

TRUMP:

Yeah, please.

QUESTION:

Is it still possible to get a trade deal with the Chinese this week, or is it--

TRUMP:

--It's possible--

QUESTION:

--You've never said--

TRUMP:

--They're all here. Look, the vice premier, who's one of the most respected men, one of the highest officials in China, is coming. You know, you heard he wasn't coming. He's coming.

I will say this. Once the tariffs went on, they upped the meeting. It was supposed to take place originally on Thursday. Then about five weeks ago they said how about Friday, how about next week? I said what's this all about? And I said that's okay. Let's--don't worry about it. Let's take in $100 billion a year. And we put the tariffs on. We made the statement and then they upped the meeting. How about let's go back to Thursday?

So, I have no idea what's going to happen. I did get last night a very beautiful letter from President Xi, let's work together. Let's see if we can get something done. But they renegotiated the deal. I mean, they took--whether it's intellectual property theft, they took many, many parts of that deal and they renegotiated. You can't do that.

And I'm different than a lot of people. I happen to think that tariffs, for our country, are very powerful. You know, we're the piggy bank that everybody steals from, including China. We've been paying China $500 billion a year for many, many years. China rebuilt their country because of us. They couldn't have done what they're doing. They're building a ship every three weeks. They're building aircraft like you've never seen, fighter jets.

I respect it. I don't blame them. I blame our past leadership for allowing this to happen. What I'm doing now with China should have happened many years ago, not just Obama, long before Obama. I always say, you know, if you look NAFTA is one of the worst deals ever made, trade deals.

But the worst trade deal ever made is the WTO, because China was flatlining for many, many decades, many, many. It was flat, right here. The WTO came along. We allowed China into the WTO and they became a rocket ship. You got to take a look at a chart some time. Do it. It'll be very interesting, and economic chart. They're here, and they went up like a rocket ship.

Well, they did it with our money, and others. And they did it because they're very smart and they're good people. And I like the president a lot. He's a friend of mine. But I'm representing the USA and he's representing China. And we're not going to be taken advantage of anymore. We're not going to pay China $500 billion a year.

So, we put very heavy tariffs on China as of Friday, and we put them on also eight months ago. And when people looked at the economic numbers, they were shocked. When they look at the import/export numbers, they were shocked. They said, wow, how did they get to this point? This was very good. That was a very good report. They've never seen that for many years.

I said try looking at all of the tariffs that China has been paying us for the last eight months, billions and billions of dollars. And that's only because I gave them a break. Because we were negotiating--goodwill, we were negotiating, I gave them a break. And I said let's keep it at 10 percent instead of 25 percent.

So, now what we're doing is we're raising it to 25 percent on Friday. So, it'll be $250 billion at 25 percent and it'll be $325 billion at 25 percent, and we're starting that paperwork today. So, we'll see. But you know what? As President of our country, I had to do something about it. And as president of our great country, we're going to be taking in more money than we've ever taken in.

And all of these countries, many of them have taken advantage of us, including our allies. They've taken advantage of us on trade. They've taken advantage of us on military. We defend all these countries or nothing or for a tiny fraction of what it costs.

We take care of NATO. I'm all for NATO. I'm all for NATO. And I think it's just wonderful, but it's different than it was 25 years ago and 40 years ago. And I got NATO to put up an extra $100 billion. Ask Secretary General Stoltenberg. He's, like, Donald Trump's biggest fan because spending was going down. The--the contributions that the 28 countries were making, it was heading like--like a slope down, like a very steep mountain. And then I came and it went up like China. It went up like a rocket ship, okay?

But I don't like seeing people take advantage. We pay for anywhere from 70 percent to 100 percent of NATO. So, we protect NATO. We protect European countries. And we protect them, and we protect them beautifully. We're the power. We're the most powerful nation, especially since we've redone our military, redoing and done all of the nuclear. You never want to use it, but you have to have it.

But we've spent, and I thank Congress for this, $700 billion, and then $717--16 billion on our military. Our military, when I came to office, was totally depleted. We now have by far the strongest military in the world. But we defend countries. When you look at our budget--so, we're at $716 billion, and Russia's at $68 billion. How do you figure that? Because Russia doesn't go around defending every country in the world and not getting paid for it.

And you know what? I don't mind not getting paid if there's a country that's been horribly treated and lots of bad things are happening and they're not a rich country. But when we defend the richest countries in the world and they don't pay us for or what we do. And frankly, they go back into closed meetings, and they laugh at the stupidity of the United States for doing it. These are countries with nothing but cash. They could very easily--I told a story last night. I picked up $500 million with one phone call to a country, and that's just the beginning. And I've done it with many other countries anyway. But just over the last very short period of time. One phone call that lasted for a period of, I would say, five minutes, I picked up $500 million because I said you're not taking care of us. We're taking care of you, but you're not taking care--it's not fair. So really the word is not fair. NATO doesn't treat us fairly at all. But now they're starting to pay. And if you look at Mr. Stoltenberg, he will tell you he has never seen anything like it. $100 billion. And that's a low number. They're paying $100 billion (INAUDIBLE).

But how do you feel about this? Germany, you're supposed to be paying 2 percent. Germany is paying 1 percent. They say 1.3, but call it 1 percent because it really is closer to 1 percent. Germany pays to Russia billions of dollars a month for the pipeline, and yet we're supposed to be defending Germany from Russia. So Germany is giving the so-called enemy--I don't call it an enemy. I want to get along with Russia, and I want to get along with China because I'm smart. Stupid people don't want to get along. Because I'm smart. This witch hunt hurt us in our relationships with a lot of countries. It was a very expensive, horrible thing for our country. And by the way, should never ever happen again to a president. Two years I've been going through this nonsense, and now we have a good report, and now guys like Jerry Nadler who I fought for many years, successfully I might add, back in New York in Manhattan. He was a Manhattan congressman. I beat him all the time, and I come to Washington, and now I have to beat him again over nothing, over nothing, over a hoax. And they know it's a hoax. They're smart. Nadler is a smart guy. Schiff is a smart guy. When Schiff goes to the microphone he's conning this whole country, and he knows that. And he goes back into a room and he talks to his friends, and he laughs because that's the way life is.

But our country is doing great. We're going to find out about China tonight, and I think in the end you're going to be very impressed with the kind of things we're doing. And the reason they were so surprised with the numbers two, three weeks ago--not the 3.2 GDP, which everybody was surprised at, but maybe more importantly export numbers, import numbers, because we have billions of dollars coming to our country that our country never would have seen with a regular president. They should have been done many years ago. And I told President Xi of China, and I tell Abe, who is a good friend of mine, prime minister of Japan, doing a great job, I tell him--I tell everybody, I say I don't blame you. I blame the people that ran the United States. And I blame their trade representatives, and frankly, I blame our presidents because this should have never happened. We've been losing, for years, close to $800 billion--not million. $800 million is a lot--but we have been losing $800 billion on trade, $800 billion. We're going to stop that, and we've already started. So we have a meeting tonight at 5:00 with the top people from China, and we'll let you know what happens. Thank you all very much.

QUESTION:

There was a moment in your rally last night when someone in the crowd seemed to say (INAUDIBLE).

(APPLAUSE)

TRUMP:

The Red Sox are coming in a little while. I like the Red Sox.

QUESTION:

What do you say to those who argue that you're too divisive, and do you worry it's going to hurt your reelection (INAUDIBLE)?

TRUMP:

You know, it’s interesting; Puerto Rico--just so you understand, we gave Puerto Rico $91 billion for the hurricane. That’s the largest amount of money ever given to any state--talking about states and Puerto Rico, a little different--$91 billion. Texas got $30. Florida got $12. Puerto Rico got $91 billion. So I think the people of Puerto Rico should really like President Trump. Now that money was given by Congress, but they got $91 billion. Now you remember how big the hurricane was in Texas, the largest water dump in the history of our country they say. Three times it went in, went out, went in. Texas got $30 billion. Florida got actually anywhere between $9 and $12. Puerto Rico got $91 billion, and now the Democrats are trying to hold up the money from Georgia, from South Carolina, from Alabama, to Florida. They’re trying to hold it up. They’re hurting Florida. They’re holding--I mean, what they’re doing to North Carolina, to Louisiana, they’re trying to hold relief aid because Puerto Rico, which got $91 billion, have to love their president, they want to get Puerto Rico more money. So they’re willing to sacrifice Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, Louisiana and other states. The Democrats are doing that. They are very divisive people. Thank you very much.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-fix/trumps-very-deceptive-qanda-with-reporters-annotated/2019/05/09/0a3d5415-8e90-4343-b451-89bf7b58906a_story.html,2019-05-09T14:57:15Z,Washington Post,"1301 K St NW, Washington, DC 20071"
What Has the NCAA—or Anyone—Learned From the College Basketball Black Market&#x27;s Time on Trial?,"The verdicts came down Wednesday in the second college basketball corruption trial in federal court in New York. Oh, you missed that? Don’t worry. Nearly everyone else did, too.

The investigation was announced with great fanfare after the arrests were made on the morning of Sept. 26, 2017. “We have your playbook,” FBI assistant director William Sweeney said at a press conference. Said Joon Kim, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York: “For the 10 charged men, the madness of college basketball went well beyond the Big Dance in March. Month after month, the defendants exploited the hoop dreams of student-athletes around the country, allegedly treating them as little more than opportunities to enrich themselves through bribery and fraud schemes.”

I’d pay at least five American dollars to see a video of the dueling chef’s kisses those two federal employees almost assuredly used to punctuate the formulation of those statements. I’d also love to hear an honest appraisal of the federal government’s investigation into college basketball now that all the plea deals have been struck and the trials have ended with guilty verdicts on some counts and not-guilty verdicts on others. On that day in 2017, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office promised a series of events that would shake college basketball to its core. Today, we know what the millions of our tax dollars they spent on the investigation netted: A fart in a stiff wind. Here’s the final tally.

• Four Power 5 assistant coaches: They all took plea deals, but you’ve only heard of one of them. Former Auburn assistant Chuck Person played in the NBA for a long time. The most interesting of the assistants snared was Arizona’s Emanuel “Book” Richardson, who claimed in communications intercepted by FBI surveillance that despite a respectable six-figure salary, he was going broke because he was paying recruits out of his own pocket.

• One low-level hustler: Christian Dawkins, truly the man at the center of the investigation, was a runner for agent Andy Miller. Dawkins was convicted Wednesday of bribery for paying assistant coaches to influence players with regard to their agent selection. Dawkins also was convicted of fraud following an October trial.

• One shoe company executive: Former Adidas director of global sports marketing Jim Gatto was convicted of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud following the October trial.

• One shoe company consultant: Former Adidas consultant Merl Code was convicted of wire fraud following the October trial and of bribery on Wednesday.

• One shady financial advisor: Munish Sood took a plea deal that included three felonies and testified against those who chose to fight the charges.

• One clothier: Yes, you read that correctly. Atlanta suit guy Rashan Michel copped a plea deal for his role in helping arrange bribes.

The FBI also arrested a Florida-based AAU coach named Brad Augustine, but the charges against Augustine were dropped when he told prosecutors he kept any money intended for players and their families for himself.

That’s it. No sexy names. No sexy charges. (Probably because there is no applicable law against paying people for being good at basketball.) For a moment, it appeared LSU coach Will Wade and Arizona coach Sean Miller would have to take the witness stand in the trial that just wrapped, but the presiding judge nixed their testimonies before the trial because while they would have been the most interesting things to come out of this entire waste of public resources, they didn’t relate directly enough to the charges against Dawkins and Code.

At one point, Kansas claimed it was the victim of a plot by the now-convicted Adidas employees. So that means that after the aforementioned victimization, Kansas dumped its Adidas apparel deal and and signed up with Nike or Under Armour or British Knights, right? Noooooooooope. The Jayhawks cut a new, richer deal with the Three Stripes last month.

Meanwhile, the NCAA empaneled a blue-ribbon committee to produce suggestions to clean up college basketball. The committee’s recommendations?

• End the one-and-done rule. (Which is something the NBA and its players association—not the NCAA—created.)

• Maybe don’t let shoe companies influence the recruiting process so much. (Did the committee have a suggestion for replacing the economic driver for grassroots basketball in America? Not really.)

Meanwhile, the investigation and two trials implicated three Power 5 head coaches in scenarios that don’t violate any law but violate multiple NCAA rules. Somewhere, there’s audio of LSU coach Will Wade talking about a “strong-ass offer” to a middleman representing Javonte Smart, who was the Tigers’ sixth man this past season. Richardson was heard in audio played in court claiming that Arizona head coach Sean Miller paid former Wildcat and 2018 NBA top pick Deandre Ayton to attend the school. Audio of Richardson claiming Wade had a $300,000 deal for forward Naz Reid also was played in court. In the October trial, Adidas-sponsored bagman T.J. Gassnola painted a picture of Kansas coach Bill Self as at least aware of how shoe company dollars were used to land players for his program.

Has the NCAA hammered Wade, Miller, Self or their schools? Nooooooooope. Wade was suspended from LSU’s last regular-game through the end of the Tigers’ NCAA tournament run, but he has since been reinstated. Miller missed a game near the end of the 2017–18 season but coached all year. Self never missed a game, but Kansas was more than happy to hang player Silvio De Sousa out to dry after bagman Gassnola dished on his recruitment during the first trial. Will the NCAA do anything to these coaches? Maybe. But it hasn’t so far.

This is probably for the best, because no definitive proof was offered at trial. But a lack of definitive proof never stopped the NCAA’s enforcement arm before, so you can imagine why other coaches are fuming at a perceived lack of action. Ten years ago, if an assistant coach had told an NCAA investigator what Richardson was caught saying about Miller, the head coach in question would have gotten a 10-year show cause penalty. The old NCAA cops just needed someone to make the accusation. We’ll see what the new ones do. The wheels of NCAA justice turn slowly, so it could be a year or two before we learn if the FBI’s investigation tripped up any head coach besides Rick Pitino, who was fired by Louisville when an indictment accused the school of being involved in a payment for recruit Brian Bowen. (In the upset of the year, Pitino—who claimed in a different NCAA case that he didn’t know his employees were buying strippers for recruits—was the one coach made to look better by testimony in the trial. He apparently was oblivious to everything, according to Dawkins.) Wade led LSU to an SEC regular-season title. Miller and Self are boldfaced names at blueblood programs. They probably were the pelts FBI agents envisioned hanging on the wall when they started this investigation.

I almost hope the NCAA does nothing from this point forward. This case generated such a huge collective yawn that no one in the public outside fans of LSU, Kansas and Arizona’s rivals actually cares what happens to the coaches at those programs. Other coaches within the sport and athletic directors at schools that aren’t competitive enough to team with shoe companies to buy players care deeply, but NCAA inaction in spite of more evidence than the NCAA’s enforcement department could ever hope to collect might finally prompt those people to admit what most of the public has already figured out. The only reason this system of handlers, middlemen and under-the-table payments exists is because the NCAA’s rules—which were voted into existence by the schools—created the market. An arbitrary cap on paying people who provide a valuable service will create a black market 100% of the time, and perhaps the people who run college sports are nearly ready to accept that the only way to neutralize the black market is to change the rules. An unwillingness by the NCAA to enforce its own rules in this case might be enough to push the last of the true believers to finally accept reality on reality’s terms.

Those of us who cover college sports could have told feds they were wasting their time if they’d asked. The public stopped caring a while back about whether college athletes got slid a few extra hundreds or a few extra thousands by middlemen looking to get rich on the backs of those athletes. Fans have been watching the coaches and athletic directors get progressively richer off the backs of those athletes for decades. The athletes are compensated, sure. And free tuition, room and board is valuable compensation. But this is America. Everyone has a right to demand a raise. And the money flowing through the black market proves some players are worth more than they’re getting. Most fans don’t mind anymore if the players get that money.

My rhetoric on this subject hasn’t changed since I started writing for SI. What has changed is the response to it. When I wrote in 2011 that the most sensible solution to most of these issues was to allow players to profit off their likenesses while not changing the amount of compensation that schools offer directly, readers thought I was crazy. Now? A lot of them would be fine with it. A Republican congressman introduced a bill in the U.S. House earlier this year that would force the schools to allow such a scenario. At the Final Four, NCAA president Mark Emmert didn’t dismiss the idea out of hand—which is progress considering he and others of his ilk would have laughed at it two or three years ago.

If Emmert and the commissioners, presidents and athletic directors who run major college sports learn anything from the FBI’s investigation and the subsequent trials, it should be that public sentiment has turned. This is the sort of thing that would have drawn massive attention back when we clucked our tongues at football players getting free shopping sprees at Foot Locker. But the world has changed. Hardly anyone cared about players getting money, so why not cut out the slimy middlemen and give the players an avenue to collect the money themselves?

Will that happen? Eventually, but probably not quite yet. More immediately, this is the result we should expect after the FBI dove into the cesspool that is college basketball and emerged with Chuck Person and a bunch of guys most people had never heard of…",https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2019/05/09/ncaa-trial-fbi-bribery-corruption-mark-emmert,2019-05-09T10:27:00Z,SI.com,"225 Liberty St., New York, NY 10281"
Teaching Scripture in public schools,"Florida's bill, which not only encourages but also requires public high schools to have an elective religion course, called for either ""objective study of religion"" or ""objective study of the Bible""; consideration of the bill was indefinitely postponed this month.

GLASGOW, Kentucky — Todd Steenbergen leads worship services in church sometimes, but today he was preaching in a different venue: the public-school classroom where he teaches.

""A lot of people will look at the Beatitudes and glean some wisdom from them,"" he told the roomful of students, pointing toward the famous blessings he had posted on the board, some of the best-known verses in the Bible. ""I want you to think about what kind of wisdom we can get from these today.""

While Steenbergen was urging students to draw lessons from the Bible here in southern Kentucky, students in Paducah - halfway across the state - were reading from the Gospels as well, in a classroom where they drew pictures of the cross and of Adam and Eve walking with dinosaurs, hanging them on the walls.

Scenes of Bible classes in public school could become increasingly common across the United States if other states follow Kentucky's lead in passing legislation that encourages high schools to teach the Bible.

Activists on the religious right, through their legislative effort Project Blitz, drafted a law that encourages Bible classes in public schools and persuaded at least 10 states legislatures to introduce versions of it this year. Georgia and Arkansas recently passed bills that are awaiting their governors' signatures.

Among the powerful fans of these public-school Bible classes: President Donald Trump.

""Numerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible,"" Trump tweeted in January. ""Starting to make a turn back? Great!""

Proponents of Bible instruction - such as Chuck Stetson, who publishes a textbook that he says is already in use in more than 600 public schools across the nation - are thrilled. ""We're not too far away from a tipping point. Instead of having to find a reason to teach the Bible in public schools academically, as part of a good education, you're going to have to find a reason not to do it,"" Stetson said. ""When the president of the United States gives us a shout-out, that's pretty crazy. . . . It's got the momentum now.""

Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a nonpartisan advocacy group organizing opposition to the state laws, takes a dark view of Project Blitz. The organization coordinated a statement signed by numerous religious groups that oppose Project Blitz's efforts - including the Union for Reform Judaism, the Hindu American Foundation, Muslim Advocates, the Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the United Methodist Church.

""It's part of an effort to establish this sort of narrow Christian agenda as the norm for our country, the government-sanctioned and supported norm,"" said Rachel Laser, the president and chief executive of the Americans United group.

- - -

In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled in School District of Abington Township v. Schempp that school-led Bible reading is an unconstitutional religious practice. But the court noted that teaching the Bible was allowed: ""Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment.""

Advocates of these classes view the Bible as a key component of a well-rounded education, key to understanding Western literature and American history. Such classes have long been offered by some public schools across the nation, sometimes taught by public-school employees with textbooks paid for by school budgets. Other times, schools have adopted ""released time"" rules that let students use part of their school day attending church-taught classes. West Virginia is now embroiled in a legal battle over such a policy.

Even those opposed to Bible classes in public schools often agree that religious literacy can be valuable if it is incorporated into world-religions or history classes.

But that is not what is called for in the state bills supported by Project Blitz, an effort of the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation, which describes its purpose as protecting ""the free exercise of traditional Judeo-Christian religious values and beliefs in the public square.""

Leaders of Project Blitz did not respond to inquiries from The Washington Post.

According to Americans United's analysis of the texts of state Bible-class bills, all but South Carolina's - which includes permission to teach alternatives to evolution, along with ""religions of the world"" - focus on the Christian Bible.

The Alabama, Georgia and West Virginia's bills say schools can teach the Old or New Testament, or both. Florida's bill, which not only encourages but also requires public high schools to have an elective religion course, called for either ""objective study of religion"" or ""objective study of the Bible""; consideration of the bill was indefinitely postponed this month.

Mississippi and North Dakota's bills failed this year. The rest are still up for consideration, according to state legislative trackers.

The model for many of these states is Kentucky, where state standards for elective Bible education became the law in 2017. The American Civil Liberties Union swiftly responded, issuing a letter that said it would closely monitor all school districts in the state. The organization flagged four school districts in Kentucky, warning that the materials used to teach the Bible in those schools suggested they were violating the Constitution and might lead to a future ACLU lawsuit.

Two of the four districts have since stopped offering a Bible class, saying student interest was low.

The remaining two are in Glasgow and Paducah. Both are in mostly rural counties where residents are vastly more likely to hold evangelical Christian beliefs than those of any other religious affiliation, according to the Association of Religion Data Archives. Very few residents of either county belong to a non-Christian religious group.

At Barren County High School in Glasgow, principal Brad Johnson refers to the school he graduated from and now leads as ""a prayerful school"" and ""a church-involved community."" On days when they are at school but students are not, teachers lead prayers over the loudspeaker. Johnson, also a Sunday-school teacher, says he sometimes drops in on Steenbergen's Bible class for ideas. He said parents are glad their children take the Bible class because they know Steenbergen is ""a Christian man"" who leads Baptist services outside school and Fellowship of Christian Athletes programs in school.

Students describe Steenbergen's Bible class as a chance to do something they enjoy during the school day - Cole Wilson, who took the class in a previous semester, likened reading the Bible in school to getting the chance to shoot hoops during gym class.

""I like studying the Bible anyway,"" agreed Mattie Coomer, who also took the class. ""As a Christian, I believe the Bible, it's a living book - if God is a living God, he's going to speak through his word every time you open up the Bible. It's more important than any other book I could be reading.""

Coomer said she just finished reading the Bible, from Genesis through Revelation, outside of school, and then started all over again. But that's not what happens in the classroom. In Steenbergen's Bible class, the students hardly read the Bible at all.

There is no classroom set of Bibles for every student, no encouragement to download a Bible app on their smartphones. He never assigns chapters or verses to read. Instead, he said, he summarizes biblical stories for them and focuses class time on highlighting connections between the Bible and modern life.

During one class this spring, he spent most of the hour-and-a-half period on a game in which students guessed which theme from the Gospel of Matthew or which blessing from the Beatitudes that Steenbergen meant to connect to when he played clips from country songs and Disney movies.

His consistent message throughout the game was that students should draw moral lessons from the Gospels.

"" 'Pure in spirit' is a good word to equate to humility, humble,"" he said. ""We see humility, a wise thing that could be applicable for us today. How many of us would like to be more humble about something?"" And later: ""Was there a time you helped provide some cheer for someone and it made you aware how good it was? . . . We can use wisdom and apply it in new ways today and help people be comforted.""

That was the sort of teaching that concerned ACLU lawyers, who flagged Steenbergen's class as a potential lawsuit waiting to happen.

""We urge you to put in place mechanisms for monitoring these courses as they are implemented to ensure that they do not run afoul of the students' and parents' constitutional rights,"" the ACLU wrote to the Kentucky Department of Education.

Steenbergen, one of four members of the committee that wrote the statewide standards for public-school Bible education, said he thinks he is toeing a constitutionally permissible line - in an unusual way. His solution is simply leaving out parts of the Bible.

In the Beatitudes, he omits phrases. "" 'For theirs is the kingdom of heaven,' for example - I don't want to go that deep,"" he said. ""It relates to some discussions that we don't want to get to in the classroom. I'm just saying the themes, how sometimes those themes still show up today and are influences for some people.""

He skips much of Paul's letters for the same reason: ""So much of it is doctrinal that I don't feel that I should cross the line to promote certain items.""

At McCracken County High in Paducah, Ellen Powless takes a different approach in teaching her Bible class.

All students have a Bible in print as well as a Bible app on their phones or school-issued laptops. Students read chapters for homework and spend much of their class time going line by line through the text together.

Powless paces the room, steering her students through question after question about the words of Scripture.

""Tell me about Isaac. What do we know about Isaac?"" she said one morning this semester.

Silence. ""That's OK,"" said Powless, who has taught English for 21 years in the school she also grew up in. ""Let's go to the text - Genesis 25.""

"" 'Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife, because she was barren,' "" she read. ""Hmm, what other character have we seen that's dealt with barrenness?""

In class, she calls biblical figures ""characters"" and always refers to ""their god,"" not to ""God.""

When she began the Exodus story, she briefly noted that historical evidence does not necessarily bear out that any mass exodus of Jewish slaves from Egypt ever happened, though she said she did not have time to teach about that evidence.

Her students are already familiar with the Bible - almost all of them participate in religious extracurriculars such as prayer groups and Fellowship of Christian Athletes. On the day that Powless talked about Exodus, 50 McCracken County students had just embarked on a school-sponsored trip to El Salvador, run in conjunction with a Christian group, Starfish Orphan Ministry. On a trip blog, students described writing ""Jesus loves you"" in the sand and telling people ""God bless you"" as they handed them ham sandwiches.

Maggie Dowdy said she picked this course because she thought it would be easy. After all, she already knew the Bible from church.

When the class started with the very first Bible story - the story of creation - she was glad she had chosen it. Here at last was the story of human origins that she believed in - not the facts of evolution that she had been taught in her high school science class.

""When I started learning about [evolution], I thought: 'That's not true. Here's what I believe,' "" Dowdy said. ""I just kind of push it aside now. I know what I believe in. It's just something the teachers have to teach us, but, no, I believe in creation.""

Other students echoed her. ""We've always in science learned that perspective, evolution and the big bang,"" Morgan Guess said. ""This is the class that allows us the other perspective.""

Only Katie King, 17, expressed doubts about the Bible in a discussion one morning. ""I took this class to see for myself if this is what I wanted to follow and believe,"" she told classmates. ""My parents are so religious. They push it a lot.""

""The Bible per se, some things I'm just like - I don't know,"" said King, who acknowledged that she is often an outlier among her peers because she supports abortion rights and likes reading New York Times articles about politics. ""Like one thing - I don't get that people who are good people, genuinely good, nice people, have good intentions, but because they don't believe in God, they're doomed to hell. I can't accept that. I cannot accept that.""

She hopes to find faith, or to understand her lack of it, she said. But she is no longer sure that her Bible class can offer her an answer.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190509/teaching-scripture-in-public-schools?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T09:50:00Z,Panama City News Herald,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA"
"Waffle House, Morpheus and the awakening of Georgia Tech","ATLANTA -- Twenty years ago, the idea began to take root in Geoff Collins' mind.

He'd look around at the city of Atlanta, the campus of Georgia Tech and the recruiting territory within its grasp, and imagine the possibilities. Unfazed by the reality of being a 28-year-old former Division II linebacker-turned-grad assistant, he would work under coach George O'Leary by day, study for a secondary degree in psychology at night and dream of what he would do if eventually he were the one in charge.

He grew up a determined sort in nearby Conyers, unafraid to think outside the box. He even had the gall to tell others his plans. Brent Key, an offensive lineman at the time, remembers those conversations well. He was struck by the fact that even though Collins didn't go to Tech as a student or play for the football team, he felt like one of them.

There was no if about it when Collins spoke. He didn't want just any program. He had his sights on this exact one.

""When I'm the head coach at Georgia Tech ..."" Collins would say before starting in on one idea or another.

Many of the details of those conversations have been lost over time. Truth be told, Collins has so many ideas about so many things that remembering them all is next to impossible. But the sentiment he expressed back then was clear: whatever he was planning, it was big.

It was a dream he'd carry with him as he dotted the college football map -- first with stops as an assistant at Western Carolina, UCF and FIU, and then later as a defensive coordinator at Mississippi State and Florida. There was even a formative year spent off the field as Nick Saban's director of player personnel during the beginning of the Alabama dynasty in 2007.

When he was 45 years old, Temple made Collins a head coach for the first time. He went 15-10 in two seasons before Georgia Tech athletic director Todd Stansbury called offering the chance to return to Atlanta and replace Paul Johnson, who was stepping down after 11 seasons.

Others might have seen a middling ACC program with cumbersome academic standards, or a Frankenstein roster built entirely for the purposes of running the antiquated triple-option, or how powerhouses like Clemson, Georgia and Alabama were a bit too close for comfort. But Collins only saw the possibilities. Located in what is essentially the capital of college football, surrounded by a talent base that rivals any in the country, why couldn't it become the Georgia Tech of his dreams?

""I've always had a clear vision of what this place can be and should be,"" he said.

And what is that?

Hold onto your seats, folks.

""To be the elite of college football.""

There were two primary things Collins focused on when he spoke to Stansbury about the job. The first was culture.

Now if you've read pretty much any story about a coaching change before, your eyes probably are glazing over because you know culture is arguably the most overused word in the coaching lexicon. It can mean everything or nothing at all.

Collins told Stansbury, ""We have to make sure it's high energy, it's engaging, it's fun, it's exciting, it's hard-working."" And at 6:20 a.m. on a Thursday last month, that was on full display when a staff meeting began with cake, candles and the singing of ""Happy Birthday"" to one of the players.

At one point, when the birthday boy left and coaches got down to business, Collins lectured everyone on positivity. He told them he didn't want them cussing out players during practice for simple mistakes. He didn't want them hung up on roster deficiencies, either. As long as the effort was there, he urged his assistants to build players up rather than tear them down.

""I've been around some legendary coaches in the game,"" Collins said. ""But I'm an avid reader and I'm constantly trying to find better ways to do things, and being free of thought enough to embrace that this is the generation we're coaching right now, how can we help them within the structure of our program? A lot of that has to do with, I don't want them to fear failure. A lot of that comes back to them knowing we care about them.""

Later, in the five or so minutes before position meetings begin, 2 Chainz blared over the loudspeakers. Collins, the inventor of the Swag Chalice, bobbed his head to the beat as he went around the room, hugging the necks of more than a few players.

""I think we're in the epicenter of college football. It radiates from here in Atlanta. Here in our footprint are some of the best programs in the country, and that's fine because we have so much to sell here."" Geoff Collins

During the full team meeting, there was a one-man dance-off featuring a student volunteer that had the entire room doubling over in laughter. Collins awarded slick arm sleeves for the top performers from the previous day's practice and turned giddy when he asked players about the new socks they just got in from Adidas. The more they win, the more swag they'll get, he promised.

By the time practice began, there was no shortage of excitement. There was a DJ on the sideline, players autographed the ""Get the Ball"" board after each turnover, and a ""Game of Thrones""-style gold crown made the rounds.

Some of it might appear superficial, but there's a method to the madness. At one point during practice, Collins came to the sideline grinning from ear to ear.

""We ran 45 plays in one 11-minute period!"" he said. ""That's fast!""

Just like that, he was gone.

""That's the culture we want,"" said the team's general manager, Patrick Suddes. ""The DJ at practice, the fun workouts we do, they're busting their ass. But you have all the coaches dressed as 'Game of Thrones' characters"" -- as well as leprechauns on St. Patrick's Day and bunnies on Easter -- ""We're doing crazy stuff and you don't think about it, but they're getting better and stronger and having fun.""

Tight end Tyler Davis transferred from UConn, where he got to face Temple in the American Athletic Conference. Because of that, he knows going against a Collins-coached team is not some hourslong dance party.

""Hard-nosed,"" is how Davis described it. ""You knew they'd knock you in the mouth.""

Funny thing about the tight ends at Georgia Tech: There were none last year. Same for slot receivers.

Instead, there were 13 scholarship running backs, which is twice the number you'd expect. What's more, there are smaller offensive and interior defensive linemen than your typical Power 5 school.

""We can't flip it all at once,"" he said, ""but these are the players we love and care for and need to put in a position to be successful.""

If you were creating a bingo board for Collins, the phrase ""position flexibility"" would be a featured block. At practice, there were running backs playing linebacker and corners playing receiver. Two days earlier, there was a receiver at outside linebacker and a nose guard at fullback.

Utilizing the free-agency stream otherwise known as the transfer portal, he and Collins were able to add an experienced tight end (Davis from UConn) and offensive lineman (Jared Southers from Vanderbilt). There might be more to come this summer.

But they're playing the long game, too. Collins keeps two copies of the book ""Recruit or Die"" in the building -- one in his office for himself, and another in the staff meeting room to remind his assistants what the lifeblood of the program is. The subtitle of the book feels especially applicable to Georgia Tech: ""How Any Business Can Beat the Big Guys in the War for Young Talent"".

Unlike in years past where the school recruited to a specific scheme, all aisles are open now. During an off day from practice, Suddes helped orchestrate what they call the ""404 Takeover"" during which each assistant on staff visited eight schools within the perimeter of Atlanta in a 24-hour period.

""You have coaches saying they haven't seen a Tech coach in 11 years,"" Suddes said. ""They were recruiting different guys, but you have kids coming on campus who say they haven't been here before. It's been like they forgot Georgia Tech was in Atlanta.""

For too long the state has served as a feeder system to everyone but the Yellow Jackets. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence -- a former five-star prospect from Cartersville, Georgia -- practically had to drive through Atlanta to reach stardom at Clemson. The same can be said for safety Xavier McKinney and his path from Roswell, Georgia, to the starting lineup at Alabama.

In fact, there's an argument to be made that Georgia is moving up the list of the country's top talent producers. California, which was long held as the superior state, had 33 ESPN 300 prospects in the 2019 class, compared to Georgia's 35. The upcoming 2020 class offers more of the same: Georgia 31, California 23.

Because of that untapped potential, Collins doesn't hesitate to say, ""The sky's the limit for this program.""

""I think we're in the epicenter of college football,"" he said. ""It radiates from here in Atlanta. Here in our footprint are some of the best programs in the country, and that's fine because we have so much to sell here. The city, a lot of places that are in our five-hour radius can't sell a city like Atlanta. The education, not everyone can sell.

""We welcome that challenge. We want to be in that conversation where when that recruit lists his top-five or top-10 -- the guys we're going to be recruiting, those guys should be listing those great programs, and we should be in the mix.""

The second thing Collins sold Stansbury on was brand. Whereas culture can sometimes feel intangible in college football, brands are more obvious. Alabama is strictly business, for instance, while Clemson borders on folksy.

Under Collins, Georgia Tech appears to want to be the coolest program in the sport. Their social media feeds are a constant stream of clever hashtags and graphics. They've even started a podcast and a web video series called ""Waffle House Wednesday.""

Not many coaches have their lead graphic designer in on staff meetings, but fewer -- if any -- spend the kind of time Collins does working directly with the man everyone calls Morpheus.

(Why Morpheus? Because, according to Suddes, ""When you go into his office, he's tied into the Matrix."" His real name, for the record, is Santino Stancato, and his title is brand manager.)

Morpheus and Collins are peas in a pod. During one staff meeting, the two showed off a business card concept they came up with that was essentially a fully dressed out football player with the jersey number left empty.

Carry a Sharpie, Collins told his assistants. Because when they handed these cards out, he wanted them to fill in the jersey with each recruit's number in order to add a more personal touch.

Easily the coolest business card I've ever received. @Coach_NBurton pic.twitter.com/r1NIQ4LmwF — Rick Cauley (@16RJC) April 30, 2019

""I equate it to the movie 'A Beautiful Mind' with Russell Crowe where there's all this stuff on the wall and everybody doesn't know what it means,"" Suddes said. He later added: ""The stuff those two put out -- #404TheCulture, #404Takeover, the business cards -- everything he does, he's two steps ahead of other coaches. They catch up and he comes up with the next idea.""

When you've been off the radar as long as Georgia Tech has and your plans are as grand as Collins has for this place, you have to find a way to garner attention. Collins said he's thinking about how to create buzz -- or, better yet, brand awareness -- ""24 hours a day.""

It's all grounded in his own experience, though. He's drawing from some of the most successful coaches, using Saban's recruiting structure, Dan Mullen's practice methods, and the way O'Leary went about offseason studies and research.

But everything ultimately has the Geoff Collins touch. For it to work, the brand and the coach must be inseparable.

""I've been blessed to have all of these things to pull from, but then using my personality and who I am at my core, to filter all of those things and be genuine,"" he said. ""Because the second I run out there and I'm trying to be Nick Saban, who is an amazing coach, it's going to be disingenuous. And with this generation of athlete and this generation you're recruiting, the second you're fake, the second you're phony, you've lost. You got to keep it real. That matters.""

Time will tell whether this new version of Georgia Tech football resonates, whether the brand Collins is building has any substance, whether there's any chance of overcoming the behemoth that is Clemson in the ACC. The only certainty is that his plan has ambitions beyond what the program has been in the past and what convention says it should look like in the future.

In early April, Antonneous Clayton, the former No. 10 overall recruit in the Class of 2016, raised eyebrows when he committed to transferring to Tech from Florida. The most recent ESPN class rankings have the Yellow Jackets at No. 19 -- a far cry from 61st, 53rd and 42nd finishes of the past three classes.

It's a start. Recruiting victories have to turn into actual victories for this to get off the ground.

The good news is that while there's a lot of work to do, there's a coach who has had a lot of time to think about how he'd like to do it.

""When I was here before, we were on College GameDay, we were a top-10 program, Bobby Dodd was filled, every game had implications in the league, every game had implications nationally,"" he said. ""That's how I know this place, and that's how I want this place to be. And I know it can be because I've lived it and I've breathed it.

""We're going to go forward under those parameters.""",http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/26706900/waffle-house-morpheus-awakening-georgia-tech,2019-05-09T09:22:31Z,ESPN.com,"ESPN Plaza Bristol, CT 06010"
‘We Are Going To Take Over the Premises’,"Jesús A. Rodríguez is an editorial intern at POLITICO and a senior at Georgetown University.

The Venezuelan crisis, a months-long standoff in which opposition forces have tried to wrest control of an economically spiraling country from the socialist president, is more than 2,000 miles away from the quiet upscale environs of 30th and M streets in upscale Georgetown. But for the past three weeks, the conflict has erupted into its own pocket of chaos—one that reflects not only the unrest in its home country, but the bizarre gray area of Washington, D.C.'s diplomatic properties.

The Embassy of Venezuela’s previous occupants, the diplomatic corps of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, have been gone since April 24, after the White House revoked their status and ordered them to leave the building. They left—but not before inviting in a collection of activists as one last act of resistance from the embattled regime. For almost a month, the distinguished five-story brick building has been occupied by a group of more than three dozen activists from a collection of American anti-interventionist groups, cooking, sleeping and even watching Game of Thrones inside. By day, they hang banners out the windows of and shout slogans out of amplifiers.

Story Continued Below

Facing off against them have been Venezuelan émigrés outside the embassy, at times numbering in the hundreds, who support the government of U.S.-recognized President Juan Guaidó—and who claim the building belongs to them. Since last week, Venezuelans have been staying in tents outside, blocking the entrances to the embassy and at times confronting and harassing the leftist demonstrators face to face.

As the faceoff drags on, attracting attention from international and American outlets in Washington, an unanswered question looms over the street: When will the U.S.-recognized ambassador swoop in to take the building—and who will seize it for him?

So far, dozens of Secret Service and local police have completely surrounded the area, but they have not gone inside the building. Francisco Márquez, the political adviser to the Guaidó-appointed, Trump-approved ambassador, Carlos Vecchio, has been involved in conversations about the embassy with the State Department. Márquez told Politico Magazine on Tuesday that there was no question his team would take control of the embassy “very soon.”

When, and how they do it, turns on a thorny international law question: Who owns an embassy when it is between governments? It might seem trivial in the middle of an international political and humanitarian crisis. But the scene at the embassy is emblematic of exactly the same problems that have roiled American politics and foreign policy on the issue of Venezuela in the five months since Guaidó declared Maduro’s presidency illegitimate.

For instance, who gets to call themselves “the people?”

“It’s ironic,” Freddy Cova, a 25-year-old Venezuelan protester who has been at the embassy since last week, said in an interview. “They call themselves the people’s defenders when in fact, there’s not even one Venezuelan in there. How can they tell us, the Venezuelan community, that they know what’s best for us?” In Venezuela, though the number of people who say they recognize Guaidó as the legitimate president has dwindled to about 50 percent since January, his approval remains much stronger than Maduro’s abysmal 4 percent.

And just what does “non-interventionism” mean when a government loses popular support—and still refuses to leave?

While most Venezuelans oppose Maduro, Guaidó proclaimed himself president in January, using a provision in the constitution that allows the Venezuelan National Assembly to temporarily assume the presidency—a move that the anti-interventionist groups roundly reject because he hasn't been elected to the office. “This is about democracy for us,” Ariel Gold, co-director of Code Pink, one of the anti-interventionist groups at the embassy supporting Maduro, said in an interview. She says that Guaidó, who is also the president of the Venezuelan National Assembly, is illegitimate because Maduro won last year’s checkered elections. “I would be up in arms if Germany or any country said, ‘You know what? Popular vote, you know, blah, blah, blah—we’ve decided that Pelosi gets to run this embassy.’”

Maduro Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, who has Skyped with the leftists and said they were welcome to stay in the embassy, agrees. He reiterated his support for the anti-interventionist activists in a speech on April 26: “How crazy would it be to enter [the embassy] illegally,” referencing potential U.S. government efforts to evict the embassy activist groups. “Have we proposed doing that in the U.S. embassy here in Caracas? Never.” (The U.S. embassy in Caracas has been closed since the State Department withdrew its diplomats from there in mid-March.) Meanwhile, in Venezuela, Maduro’s government has overseen a sharp and widely documented decline in political rights, civil liberties and freedoms of expression—hardly an indication that there is much popular support behind the government.

As a point of law, the activists inside the embassy—who call themselves the Embassy Protection Collective and include Code Pink, ANSWER Coalition, Popular Resistance and the Black Alliance for Peace—say they are shielded by an international law provision that prohibits police from entering a diplomatic premise belonging to a foreign government without its consent. It’s the same provision that once precluded Turkish police from entering the Saudi consulate in Ankara to investigate the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi last October, for instance. It’s also the provision that allowed Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to seek political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and thus avoid extradition from England to Sweden.

The fact that the anti-interventionist activists at the Venezuelan embassy were invited to stay by representatives from Maduro’s government, which still controls the Venezuelan state, also means they are allowed to stay, in their view. They dismiss Carlos Vecchio, the Guaidó-appointed, Trump-credentialed ambassador, as nothing more than a “puppet.”

But legal experts say none of this means the activists have a right to occupy the embassy. Yes, the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations states that the premises of an embassy are “inviolable,” and that “agents of the receiving State may not enter them, except with the consent of the head of the mission.” But legal experts consulted by Politico Magazine, including some who have advised the State Department and the United Nations on legal issues, are highly skeptical that the embassy collective currently living there is protected by international law.

Ashley Deeks, a law professor at the University of Virginia and a member of the State Department’s advisory committee on international law, says that in this case the head of state—according to Trump—is Guaidó, and so his appointees “can actually give consent to the U.S. government to go into the Venezuelan embassy and potentially remove uninvited guests.” And in this case, she said, “the U.S. government gets to decide, since they are a state, and the Code Pink protesters are not.” In an email, a State Department official clarified the department’s view that the Guaidó-led government has legal authority over the embassy and that it “considers any unauthorized individuals on the property to be trespassers.”

Venezuelan protesters have camped outside 24/7 for more than a week, demanding the ""invaders"" exit the diplomatic premises. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO

At least three other legal experts, including two former State Department lawyers, agreed with that characterization in interviews with Politico Magazine. But the catch is that while entering the embassy to expel the protesters may be permissible from the American perspective, there may be worldwide repercussions as a result. “The United States shouldn’t take that extraordinary move lightly in light of Maduro’s continued de facto control of Venezuela,” Brian Egan, a State Department legal adviser who worked under Obama, wrote in an email exchange. “The move would be seen by Maduro supporters as an ‘invasion’ of the Venezuelan embassy ... and could provoke those who remain sympathetic to Maduro to retaliate, perhaps by attempting actions against U.S. diplomatic facilities abroad.”

There’s another vulnerability. One of Guaidó’s closest allies, the famous opposition leader and political prisoner Leopoldo López who escaped house arrest on the same day as protests began here in the embassy, has taken refuge in Spain’s consulate in Caracas. Guaidó and his team have worried Maduro might try to break in and arrest him. “If the regime does something at the Spanish consulate in Caracas, it would be violating the Vienna Convention—it would be a severe mistake to kidnap a guest,” Guaidó told reporters on Friday in Venezuela.

Márquez, Vecchio’s political adviser, says that these potentially negative consequences do not affect the decision to seize the building, which Vecchio has requested since he began his work as Guaidó’s man in Washington. (Vecchio has also taken over two military attachés and the Venezuelan consulate in New York City.) “We are going to take over the premises, there’s no doubt about it,” Márquez said. “There is no scenario where the embassy is not under our control.”

On the ground outside the embassy, though, the often chaotic crowd tells a different story about who is in control, or isn't. Some antiwar activists accuse the Venezuelans of being right-wing, fascist thugs, and the opposition protesters' yells are sometimes punctuated with racism, sexism and homophobia. Gold has accused a pro-Guaidó activist of sexual harrassment, while Venezuelans have denounced a leftist who pushed back against a pregnant woman. At night, sirens blare almost constantly from opposition megaphones, and some Venezuelans have been seen shining flashlights and strobe lights into leftists' eyes.



***

Regardless of what the Trump administration does about the embassy, it will still be unclear what the Trump administration plans to do on Venezuela.

The United States has provided more than $195 million in humanitarian aid since last year, according to official figures, and earlier this year instituted sanctions prohibiting business with the oil sector. (Until January, the United States was Venezuela’s main oil consumer.) The protesters have been clear that they oppose these sanctions, along with others imposed by the Trump and Barack Obama administrations. But beyond the aid and sanctions, the administration’s plan is less clear. Trump has not yet used his oft-mentioned “military option” in Venezuela, although he and other hawkish Republican allies and administration figures have repeatedly noted it’s “on the table.”

On Tuesday, the Trump administration lifted sanctions against the former leader of Venezuela’s intelligence service for his collaboration in last week’s attempted military takeover, in which Guaidó unsuccessfully tried to seize control of presidential Miraflores palace. It was a bid to recruit the backing of military officers for Guaidó, who has offered amnesty to Maduro and his allies if they choose to exit.

But neither the sanctions nor talk of regime change has attracted the kind of bipartisan consensus that humanitarian crises normally elicit, hobbled by the same kinds of splits on display at the embassy. Republicans have been nearly united in their staunch support of economic and sometimes military action, but Democrats have not been as quick to react. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep. Donna Shalala of Florida have met with Vecchio and sent messages of support, but progressives have been more cautious. Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar has been outspoken on the issue, blaming Venezuela’s current problems on past U.S. interventions and opposing both sanctions and regime change in a recent interview. In response, Vice President Mike Pence took quickly to Twitter to say that Omar “doesn’t know what she’s talking about” on Venezuela. In recent weeks, Bernie Sanders’ and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s equivocating answers on whether Maduro or Guaidó was the legitimate president have drawn widespread condemnation.

Which brings us back to the embassy, where protesters are having the same debate about whether American intervention will do more to help or hurt Venezuela. It was the clash I observed between Ana Galavis, a Venezuelan protester at the embassy whose son is still in her native country, and a tall, apparently American man from the protection collective.

Galavis showed the man a cardboard sign she was wearing that bore a photo of a dilapidated hospital where a woman was giving birth on the floor, presumably due to the lack of beds. As Venezuela’s economy has worsened in the past decade, the country’s healthcare system has been wracked by medicine and supply shortages and an exodus of thousands of doctors.

“Tell him this has been going on for 15 years,” she told another Venezuelan, who was translating.

“This is a doing of American imperialism,” the man, who was wearing a Ché Guevara button, responded. “This is how you destabilize a country.”

“This is not about socialism, or communism—this is about human rights,” Galavis, a restaurant worker, said.

Meanwhile, Vecchio’s team hopes to start issuing identification cards and validating expired Venezuelan passports, which Maduro stopped renewing more than a year ago. The new diplomatic team will also start managing Venezuelan assets in the United States, such as the oil company Citgo, according to Márquez. And they will continue putting international pressure on other countries and the United Nations to recognize Guaidó’s government. “This is the first embassy of a new republic,” Márquez said.",https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/08/venezuelan-embassy-nicolas-maduro-juan-guaido-226803,2019-05-08T21:57:09Z,POLITICO,"1100 Wilson Blvd Suite 601 Arlington, VA 22209 United States"
"DNA, genealogy identifies long-dead suspect in 52-year-old Seattle cold case killing","0 DNA, genealogy identifies long-dead suspect in 52-year-old Seattle cold case killing

SEATTLE - Seattle cold case detectives have solved a case that has haunted the department for more than half a century after DNA evidence and familial genealogy led them to a killer more than 30 years in his own grave.

Susan Galvin, 20, was a records clerk for the city’s police department on the night of July 9, 1967, when she failed to show up for her overnight shift. According to KIRO in Seattle, her body was found in a parking garage elevator at the Seattle Center, the 74-acre mixed-use center famed for its iconic Space Needle.

Galvin had been raped and strangled, The Associated Press reported.

Seattle police officials on Tuesday announced a resolution in the case, which thus far is the oldest case solved through public genealogy databases, the AP said. More than 60 cases have been solved through the method since it was popularized by the arrest last year of Joseph James DeAngelo, the alleged Golden State Killer.

Two of those solved cases were announced earlier this week. In one, Christopher VanBuskirk, 46, of Goodyear, Arizona, was arrested April 29 and charged in a string of four rapes committed in San Diego between August and November of 1995. Another two rapes committed in Riverside County in March 2002 and November 2004 were found to be committed by the same man.

According to San Diego police officials, VanBuskirk, who allegedly raped the women at knifepoint, was identified through genealogy databases and the DNA samples of direct family members. VanBuskirk was extradited to San Diego County on Monday, jail records show.

In the second case, Terre Haute, Indiana, police investigators linked Jeffrey Lynn Hand, who was killed by an off-duty deputy during an attempted kidnapping in 1978, to the 1972 strangulation of Indiana State University student Pamela Milam. The 19-year-old vanished the night of Sept. 15 and was found bound and gagged in her car trunk on the university’s campus the following day by her family.

Terre Haute Police Chief Shawn Keen said during a news conference Monday that Hand, who would have been in his early 20s at the time of Milam’s killing, had a violent history that, aside from the attempted abduction during which he was slain, included murder and stalking. Hand was identified as a suspect through reverse paternity, in which his children’s DNA was used to link him to genetic material left at the crime scene, Keen said.

‘Punchy’ the clown

Frank Wypych was a 26-year-old security guard in 1967, when police officials allege he raped and killed Galvin. KIRO reported that Wypych may have worked at the Seattle Center when the homicide took place.

After Galvin’s slaying, detectives interviewed dozens of people and had one suspect in mind -- a clown called “Punchy” who Galvin was reportedly seen with in the hours before she was killed. According to KIRO, Galvin spent a lot of her free time at the Seattle Center and was last seen with the clown in the area where the Seattle Center Armory now stands.

The man who worked as Punchy was located in Utah in 2016, when Seattle police Detective Rolf Norton reopened the case, and eliminated as a suspect through DNA, the news station said.

Wypych, a divorced former soldier who died of diabetes complications in 1987, was identified as a suspect in Galvin’s death after the case was reopened. His family, including his children, cooperated with the investigation, the AP reported.

The SPD detective who just helped solve a 1967 cold case murder at Seattle Center tells us what drove him to find the killer. “She was just 20-years-old, independent for the first time.” Killer was traced by DNA. He died in 1987, his body was exhumed in February. See More at 11. pic.twitter.com/ZKiZLbqNkw — Gary Horcher (@GaryKIRO7) May 8, 2019

Norton used the DeAngelo case as an inspiration and submitted DNA found on Galvin’s clothing -- which was still stored away as evidence -- to Virginia-based Parobon Nanolabs Inc. last summer. CeCe Moore, a Parobon genealogist, told the AP she used the genetic profile from the evidence and traced it to two distant cousins who branched from a single couple born in the 1820s and 1830s.

She then traced that couple’s descendants through the subsequent generations and found Wypych, who was born in Seattle and was just a few years older than Galvin at the time she was slain.

Wypych’s body was exhumed earlier this year and a DNA sample taken from his remains. The sample matched what was found on Galvin’s clothes, the AP reported.

“It’s amazing the DNA was still viable,” Moore told the AP. “The original investigators who collected the crime scene evidence did such a great job, long before they could even have imagined what could be done with DNA.”

Norton expressed a similar sentiment about the original detectives, all of whom are now deceased.

“They processed that case like it was 2015,” he told the AP.

‘No clear answer as to the why’

One of Galvin’s brothers, Chris Galvin, attended the announcement Tuesday. Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best presented him with the American flag that was flying over the Seattle Justice Center the day Norton solved his sister’s murder.

“We will never forget,” Best wrote in a tweet about the moment.

Another brother, Lorimer “Larry” Galvin, thanked Norton in a statement for finally giving the family some answers. One question remains, he said.

“Fifty-two years later, we learn the who, but still have no clear understanding as to the why,” Galvin wrote from his Florida home, according to the AP. “There will always be that lingering question.”

Wypych was married and the father of a young child when he allegedly killed Susan Galvin, the news agency said. Another child was born two years later.

In the years following Galvin’s slaying, Wypych found himself in trouble with the law, KIRO reported. He was arrested for larceny in 1971 and, in 1975, he was accused of impersonating a police officer and making traffic stops -- while armed with a gun, the news station said.

He and his wife divorced in 1971, the year of his larceny conviction. He served nine months in jail.

Though he was charged in the impersonation case in 1975, he was never convicted in that incident, the AP reported.

Norton told the AP Wypych’s children were stunned to learn of his connection to a homicide.

The detective told KIRO the fact that Susan Galvin worked for the police department made the case a personal one for many of her colleagues.

“I think everyone here who worked on this case thought a lot about Susan Galvin,” Norton told the news station. “Everyone was hopeful that someday we’d come to this end.”

Norton said he always hoped he could solve the case for Galvin’s family, which includes seven siblings.

“I guess when I look at her picture, I think of them,” Norton said. “I think of her mother and father and just this horrible loss that snatched her away in a shockingly evil act.”

Hidden in Plain Sight: Massage Parlors Selling Sex,"A website advertises, in graphic detail, what supposedly is happening inside massage parlors in the business of selling sex.

They are near pizza shops, coffee shops and schools — massage parlors that are offering more than just a massage. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey says they are in the business of selling sex.

Patriots owner Robert Kraft stands accused of soliciting prostitution from such a massage parlor in Florida. He denies the charges. But lost in the headlines of the Florida arrests are the stories of the victims, the girls and women forced into prostitution.

After the Kraft arrest, the NBC10 Boston Investigators started digging and found similar situations in Massachusetts, hidden in plain sight.

One Massachusetts woman agreed to tell her story with the hope of bringing awareness to what she says is everyone's role in perpetuating or preventing sex trafficking.

Raised in Tibet in a refugee camp, Phuni Kim Meston's parents were nomads who didn't speak English. She says she remembers the first time a minister from Northborough, Massachusetts, came to her camp.

""When I first met him, I was 12 or 13,"" Meston recalled.

She says the minister promised her an education and told her parents that ""he would treat me like his daughter and that I was really too smart to stay in the village.""

But Meston says that's not at all what happened.

Landing in Massachusetts at age 14, she went from a refugee camp in Tibet to a victim of international sex trafficking.

Prosecutors say she was subjected to ""years of forced sex"" and ""torture.""

Arizona Students Demand ICE Release Undocumented Classmate

Dozens of Tucson, Arizona, high school students walked out of class Monday morning and marched in the name of a classmate taken into Border Patrol custody last Thursday. Thomas Torres, a senior and football player at Desert View High School, was taken in by Border Patrol agents following a traffic stop. (Published Tuesday, May 7, 2019)

Meston says the minister used threats to control her and coerce her.

""I felt like I was a servant there, not to mention in the night, and he did other stuff. He told me, 'No one will believe you, even the school.' He told me my parents will go to jail in India,"" she said.

Meston later testified at the trial of the minister. He was convicted of rape and indecent assault and battery in 1992. He spent four years in prison.

In Boston, not every victim of sex trafficking comes from across the world.

Of the nearly 160 girls helped by My Life, My Choice, a Boston non-profit that helps get girls out of sex trafficking, many are American-born.

""The vast majority of people being trafficked here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are kids who've grown up here in our neighborhoods,"" said Lisa Goldblatt Grace, director of My Life, My Choice.

Burning Plane Lands at Moscow Airport; At Least 40 Dead

A passenger plane was forced to make an emergency landing after it burst into flames shortly after takeoff. (Published Sunday, May 5, 2019)

Police raids have rescued girls who were being forced to engage in sex for money from massage parlors in Beverly, Medford, Lynn and Quincy.

Grace says it is prevalent in the suburbs.

""We could tell you stories of young people we've served in Brookline, Lexington, Newton, and Wayland,"" she said.

Of the 160 girls that My Life, My Choice has helped, the average age is 14, and 85 percent are part of the state's child welfare system.

""These young people that are being exploited this way are hidden in plain sight,"" said Grace. ""They're in our schools, showing up to appointments with their primary care physician, they're in our child welfare offices.""

They may be hidden in plain sight, but they're not all that difficult to find.

The estimated billion-dollar illicit sex business is fueled in part by websites like RubMaps, a literal guide to places allegedly offering sex for money.

The website publishes reviews, in graphic detail, of what is supposedly happening inside certain massage parlors.

According to the reviews, 240 parlors in Massachusetts are offering or have offered sex services.

Each review explains the sex acts allegedly available and how much to tip for sex, giving readers in-depth details of the experience.

NBC10 Boston investigators used mapping software and found 35 of the listed massage parlors were located 1,000 feet or less from schools.

Police say their investigations of these parlors is difficult because the women often fear deportation, and many don't speak English.

UNC Charlotte Student Died Tackling Gunman

Investigators in the shooting that killed two at the University of North Carolina Charlotte called Riley Howell a hero, after the 21-year-old college junior died tackling the gunman to stop the shooting. (Published Thursday, May 2, 2019)

RubMaps did not respond to the NBC10 Boston Investigators' repeated requests for comment.

Healey has made prosecuting sex trafficking a priority. She has created a special unit that includes five state troopers and attorneys, among other staff, and has prosecuted more than 50 cases in the last few years.

""We've seen that human trafficking is the fastest-growing criminal enterprise worldwide,"" Healey said. ""For far too long, these women who are really victims of exploitation were prosecuted themselves. That has stopped, and the focus is now on those who are buying commercial sex.""

Years after her ordeal, Meston has finally found peace. She now owns Karma, a fair trade gift store in Newton that features gifts made in her home country. Meston wonders how no one noticed what was happening to her. After all, she attended school and went to the minister's church. She even cleaned the church every day.

""How could no one ask, no one went over — 'Are you OK?'"" Meston said. ""Why does this man on this farm keep bringing in these little girls?""

""It's hard for us to accept we are part of the equation,"" she added.",http://www.necn.com/news/new-england/Hidden-in-Plain-Sight-Massage-Parlors-Selling-Sex-RubMaps-Massachusetts-509621481.html,2019-05-07T23:44:20Z,NECN,"n, 3534 W Touhy Ave, Skokie, IL 60076, USA"
Cohen claimed he helped bury personal photographs of Jerry Falwell Jr. before the evangelical leader backed Trump,"Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime personal attorney, claimed to have helped prevent the release of personal photographs embarrassing to Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. shortly before the influential evangelical leader endorsed Trump’s insurgent presidential bid in 2016.

Cohen made the assertion, which was first reported by Reuters, in a phone call in March with actor Tom Arnold. Arnold provided The Washington Post with a recording of the call Tuesday night.

“There’s a bunch of photographs — you know, personal photographs — that somehow, the guy ended up getting,” Cohen said on the call. The person who had the photos, who is not identified on the call, was demanding money from the Falwells, and Cohen threatened to report the person to legal authorities, according to Reuters.

Reuters reported that the alleged episode took place months before Falwell’s endorsement of Trump. Arnold told The Post that Cohen told him it occurred during the presidential race.

A statement released by an attorney for the Falwells called the account “not accurate.”

“While the Falwells have a long-standing friendship with Michael Cohen, they never engaged or paid Cohen to represent them in any legal or other professional capacity, and Cohen did not ever resolve any legal matter on their behalf,” the statement said.

The attorney, who declined to be named, said in a follow-up text message that “there are no compromising or embarrassing photos of Falwell, period!”

Lanny Davis, a spokesman for Cohen, declined to comment. Cohen began serving a three-year prison sentence on Monday for tax evasion and campaign-finance violations.

Arnold, a staunch critic of the president’s, said he became friends with Cohen last summer, adding that the longtime Trump confidant sees him as an ally.

Arnold said Cohen did not know that he was recording their March conversation at the time, but Arnold said that he subsequently told Cohen that he had recorded it. He said he indicated to Cohen that he would release details about the Falwell portion of their conversation after Cohen went to prison.

“He knows I’m going to help him,” Arnold said, adding: “I said, ‘As soon as you go in: Jerry Falwell Jr.’ ”

Last month, Arnold shared with the Wall Street Journal his March 25 phone call with Cohen. The Journal reported on other portions of the 36-minute conversation, including Cohen denying responsibility for some of his crimes.

The longtime Trump fixer said he kept a copy of one of the Falwell photos on his phone, Cohen told Arnold on their March 25 call.

It is unclear what the photos allegedly depicted. Cohen described the images as “photos between husband, wife, and the whole bit.”

“I actually have one of the photos,” he said on the recording. “It’s terrible.”

Falwell’s early support of Trump was seen as crucial, giving the candidate a key stage in front of evangelicals, an important group of voters for Trump.

He delivered a glowing welcome to Trump during a campaign visit by Trump to Liberty University in 2016 and formally endorsed him. His continued support for Trump after the “Access Hollywood” video was released was seen as critical to the Trump campaign, although some graduates returned their diplomas over Falwell’s support.

“Jesus said ‘Judge not, lest ye be judged,’ ” Falwell wrote in an essay for The Washington Post in 2016. “Let’s stop trying to choose the political leaders who we believe are the most godly because, in reality, only God knows people’s hearts. You and I don’t, and we are all sinners.”

As recently as this week, Falwell made headlines for his lavish praise of Trump. The president shared a tweet over the weekend in which Falwell declared, “Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term as pay back for time stolen by this corrupt failed coup.”

According to the Reuters report, the Falwells asked Cohen for help with the photographs around the time Cohen was working with Liberty University to promote Trump’s candidacy in 2015.

Cohen flew to Florida, met with a lawyer for the person with the photos and informed him that his client was breaking the law, Reuters reported. Arnold said that Cohen described the Florida trip to him.

Ultimately, the lawyer told Cohen that all of the photos were destroyed, Reuters reported.

“I was going to pay him and I was going to get the negatives and do an agreement where they turn over all technology that has the photographs or anything like that, any copies,” Cohen told Arnold on the call. “And it never happened. The guy just either deleted them on his own or what have you.”

In January 2016, days before the Iowa caucuses, Falwell formally announced his backing of Trump, calling him “a successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.”

Along with religious leaders such as evangelist Franklin Graham and Florida megachurch pastor Paula White, Falwell is seen as one of Trump’s most prominent religious supporters.

He is the son of the late televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr., a megachurch pastor who helped to organize religious conservatives especially in the 1970s and ’80s. Falwell has taken the school his father started in 1971 in Lynchburg, Va., and expanded it into one of the largest Christian universities in the world, with more than 100,000 students. Last year, the university released a film suggesting Trump had fulfilled a divine prophecy.

One of the largest universities in the country, Liberty is seen as an innovator in online education and has become a prominent platform for politicians to visit. Trump gave a commencement address there in 2017, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) spoke there in 2015.

Falwell is expected to welcome Vice President Pence to deliver the university’s commencement address on Saturday.

Fort Pierce City Commission approves raise in new 3 year police union contract,"CLOSE If you see a crime being committed, leave anonymous tips with Treasure Coast Crime Stoppers. GINNY BEAGAN/TCPALM April 2019 Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

FORT PIERCE — The City Commission Monday unanimously approved a 4.5% salary increase for police officers as part of a new 3-year contract with the unions representing the rank-and-file officers and the sergeants and lieutenants.

The increase means the starting salary for a first year officer will increase from $42,802 to $44,728 and the salary of an officer with at least 10-years of experience will increase from $61,615 to $64,388, according to city records.

“It is a very fair contract,” said Al Boettjer, union representative for Coastal Florida Police Benevolent Association, which serves the supervisors.

Additional terms of the contract include a housing allowance of $3,000 per year, about $250 per month, for all officers who live in the city and have up to 10 years of service and the monthly stipend for K-9 officers will increase from $320 to $450.

The housing allowance is needed to help the city recruit and retain officers and to help fight crime, Mayor Linda Hudson said.

“It helps with community policing because the officers are living in the city and the neighborhoods and people would get to know them outside of work,” Hudson said. “And if there is some sort of criminal activity occurring, the community would be more comfortable sharing that information with our police officers because they know them.”

The Police Department should not rely on higher salaries and housing allowances to fight crime but use more of its budget for technology equipment, such as improving forensics and purchasing surveillance cameras to help fight crime, City Commissioner Reggie Sessions said.

“I support paying our officers more but there is a lot of technology out there, like ShotSpotter and putting surveillance cameras in high crime areas to help find out who is responsible for these shootings, that the city can be doing.""

ShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system used by police departments to help pinpoint the exact location of gunfire.

Inside South Florida: Steve’s New Comic Book Is Aoki-Dokie,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

DJ, music producer and now comic book creator Steve Aoki, stopped by Multiverse Corps Comics in Miami to greet fans and sign his new comic book, “Neon Future”

“Neon Future” is set 30 years from now, in response to a global crisis, the U.S government has made all advanced technology illegal.

Now, there’s a war between the augmented who have integrated technology into their bodies and the authentic who have not.

With a story so innovative and compelling about unchecked fear, I had to ask Steve about the inspiration behind ""Neon Future"".

""I'm obsessed with the idea of technology and our humanity coming together and augmenting ourselves with technology. Plus I mean I was a comic book kid so when I was a teenager, even before I got into music I was a comic book junkie. It all started with building out my concept in music and doing all of my album series called 'Neon Future' and then incorporating on there and teaming up with people that feel the same way that know how to put something like this together,"" said Aoki.

We asked him how ""Neon Future"" was different from other comic books today.

""In 'Neon Future' technology in this case isn't the bad guy, I think in the future as we progress, we are gonna use technology to benefit out lives and there's gonna be a point in time where someone won't want us to be superhuman and then that becomes a rebellion. The augmented are the saving grace of the human species when the government stops us from living our lives,"" said Aoki.

Steve’s story came to life thanks to Impact Theory. The studio is behind publishing ""Neon Future"". Steve partnered up with Co-Founder of impact theory Tom Bilyeu and writer Jim Krueger.

So we heard that talk came about after Tom found out that Steve was planning on getting cryogenically frozen.

""That is literally a true story, the man wants to be cryogenically frozen when he dies and I thought that's amazing, somebody that has that optimism for the future in general and for technology specifically so yes we hit it off on that. I'm a super techno optimist and I really believe that technology is going to be the thing that allows us to push society forward, but there is gonna be what we call trough of despair so we wanted to pick up a story that started in that trough of despair that typical dystopian future. We wanted to show people a path out of that so rather than being this sort of bleak story, Steve and I come in together and share that optimism and wanting to tell a story that ultimately is empowering about rising up out of that and what that would look like,"" said Bilyeu.

Since ""Neon Future"" is a story about survival in an advanced technological world, I had to ask Tom to give us his advice for us millennials surviving in this modern world.

""I would say that humans are the ultimate adaptation machine, the most important thing to understand is what humans are designed to do from the ground up is change, grow and get better. So no matter who you are today, don't worry about that, it's just a question on who you want to become and what's the price you're willing to pay to get there because standing between where you are today and what you want to accomplish in your life is a set of skills, that's it. You don't need school to acquire those skills, you're gonna need a lot of hard work and willingness to fail, willingness to grow and learn from so you need that mindset. So it really is possible,"" said Bilyeu.

"Boy, 11, charged with arson in connection with Sebastian boat, trailer fires","CLOSE Indian River County fire crews responded after an explosion was reported near U.S. 1 in Sebastian on Friday, March 15, 2019. A boat had caught fire. Eric Rogers, Florida Today

INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — An 11-year-old boy faces two felony counts of arson after deputies said he and a friend set fire to a trailer and boat on a lot behind a Sebastian neighborhood.

The boat fire, reported at the end of Essex Lane off Schumman Drive, caused a small explosion March 15 when flames caught on 50 gallons of fuel left aboard, sending up thick plumes of smoke to the surrounding area.

No injuries were reported in that blaze, nor when a small metal trailer on the same lot burned to the ground a month earlier.

More: Cause of Sebastian boat fire, explosion may remain mystery

Investigators with the Bureau of Fire, Arson and Explosives Investigations determined the fires were intentionally set and interviewed the boy after he was named in an anonymous tip, the warrant said.

The boy denied starting the fires but was named by two friends, who told police he had caused the boat fire by torching the seat cushions with a lighter and used lantern fuel and matches to burn the trailer.

He was arrested Friday and taken to the Department of Juvenile Justice in Fort Pierce.

Investigators also implicated one of the friends, who was present for or participated in starting the fires, according to the warrant. Sebastian police Lt. Timothy Wood said the state attorney's office is determining whether charges will be filed.

The total value of the burned property was about $7,000, investigators said.

Indian River County Fire officials originally told reporters no actions would be taken after the boat fire, despite suspicions of arson, because the boat had little or no monetary value.

Navy planes use NAS Jacksonville runway while recovery efforts continue,"<p>As a Boeing 737 jet remains in shallow water at the end of a Naval Air Station Jacksonville's runway after crashing through the seawall and into the river Friday night, Navy aircraft resumed taking off from runway 10-2-8.</p>

<p>The National Transportation Safety Administration Board said Sunday pilots of the transport flight from Guantanamo Bay requested a last-minute change to the runway where they would be anding during heavy weather.</p>

<p>The 9,000-foot-long runway where the chartered jet landed was essentially limited to 7,800 feet since there was a wire barrier set up to recover Navy aircraft in instances they couldn't land on a carrier during training, said Bruce Landsberg, vice chairman of the NTSB.</p>

<p>""We don't know what they were thinking or why they made that choice,"" Landsberg said at a news conference. ""That will be one of the things we look to find out.""</p>

<p>Landsberg didn't elaborate on the significance of the runway change but said it would be a focus of investigation.</p>

<p>NTSB investigators said they hope a cockpit voice recorder helps them answer that question, but they have been unable to recover it from the tail of the plane because it is still underwater. Investigators have retrieved the flight data recorder.</p>

<p>Landsberg said the plane recently had been in maintenance, and logs showed a left-hand thrust reverser that was inoperative. Thrust reversers are used to divert thrust from the engine, but they typically aren't used in calculating a plane's performance, Landsberg said.</p>

<p>According to a Purdue University College of Engineering description, reverse thrust can be used to help an aircraft come to a stop.</p>

<p>""We will be looking very carefully at the maintenance of the aircraft in the several weeks prior,"" Landsberg said.</p>

<p>Investigators are also asking anyone who shot video of the plane landing to share it with the NTSB.</p>

<p>There were no serious injuries on the flight from a military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, although almost two dozen of the 143 passengers and crew members sought medical attention for minor injuries.</p>

<p>Capt. Michael Connor, the base's commanding officer, said all passengers had left the base Sunday on their way to their scheduled destinations.</p>

<p>Some aircraft will be allowed to depart the base and be relocated so that pilots can continue with their training, but Naval Air Station Jacksonville will essentially be closed until the plane is removed from the river, Connor said.</p>

<p>The NTSB investigators are still deciding when and how to relocate the plane off the base, which would require the use of a barge.</p>

<p>""How the aircraft is positioned now certainly gives you limitations on a good thorough assessment,"" said NTSB investigator John Lovell. ""We are not aware of the extent of the damage under the waterline because it can't be seen.""</p>

<p>All fuel needs to be removed before the plane can be moved, and that effort was complicated by the aircraft being partially submerged in the river, as well as stormy weather on Sunday, Landsberg said.</p>

<p>Officials said they didn't know how many gallons of fuel have spilled into the river, but engineers were using booms to contain the fuel and skimmers to vacuum up contaminants.</p>

<p>The Florida Department of Environmental Protection Agency is urging anyone who sees an oil slick or distressed wildlife to call its emergency hotline number: 800-320-0519.  </p>

<p>Divers on Sunday were sent into the plane's cargo area to search and remove a handful of pets that had been unable to be rescued because of safety concerns. The investigators didn't say outright whether the animals were dead, but the pets would have been submerged for almost two days.</p>

<p>Cellphone video from passenger Darwing Silva captured the immediate, uncertain moments after the chartered jet landed.</p>

<p>A passenger shouted ""Watch out! Watch out!"" as other passengers and crew members cautiously walked out on a wing of the plane.

<p>Silva said that passengers initially were told Friday the aircraft might not be fit for takeoff. Then the flight was cleared to leave Cuba, but with the warning there would be no air conditioning.</p>

Why did pilot request runway change before crash landing at NAS Jax?,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - As a Boeing 737 jet remains in shallow water at the end of a Naval Air Station Jacksonville's runway after crashing through the seawall and into the river Friday night, we're learning more about the events that led up to the crash landing.

The National Transportation Safety Administration Board had said pilots of the transport flight from Guantanamo Bay requested a last-minute change to the runway where they would be landing during heavy weather.

A recording of air traffic radio traffic captured the exchange with the pilot of the Air Florida International fight, designated Biscayne 293.

Controller: ""Biscayne 293, just talked to Navy JAX tower. He said both runways look pretty bad, pretty socked in, showing moderate to heavy precipitation east and west of the airport. Do you want to try RNAV 28?""

Pilot: ""Looks better. And when I get closer, I’ll check how it is.""

The 9,000-foot-long runway where the chartered jet eventually landed was essentially limited to 7,800 feet since there was a wire barrier set up to recover Navy aircraft in instances they couldn't land on a carrier during training, said Bruce Landsberg, vice chairman of the NTSB.

""We don't know what they were thinking or why they made that choice,"" Landsberg said at a news conference. ""That will be one of the things we look to find out.""

Landsberg said the plane's maintenance logs showed a left-hand thrust reverser that was inoperative. Thrust reversers are used to divert thrust from the engine, but they typically aren't used in calculating a plane's performance, Landsberg said.

Reverse thrust can be used to help an aircraft come to a stop.

Capt. Wayne Ziskal, a 50-year veteran pilot who teaches at Jacksonville University’s School of Aviation said the plane came in for a landing during moderate to heavy rain, poor visibility and a tailwind of nearly 20 mph. Planes try to land against the wind, not with the wind behind it.

Ziskal estimated the crew tried to land with a ground speed of more than 200 mph -- dangerous given the conditions.

""80% of accidents have a human factors component to them,"" Ziskal said. ""When we start talking about human factors, we start talking about decision-making, critical thinking -- all the things that go into why you made the decision and why you acted the way that you did.""

Ziskal said the pilots always have the option to “go around"" -- pull out of a landing and circle back. If conditions are still bad, they can choose to land at another airport.

Investigators have retrieved the flight data recorder, but the NTSB investigators said they hope a cockpit voice recorder helps them answer that question. They have been unable to recover it from the tail of the plane because it is still underwater.

Investigators also asked anyone who shot video of the plane landing to share it with the NTSB.

There were no serious injuries on the flight from a military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, although almost two dozen of the 143 passengers and crew members sought medical attention for minor injuries and three pets died when the cargo hold in the belly of the plane went under water.

Capt. Michael Connor, the base's commanding officer, said all passengers had left the base Sunday on their way to their scheduled destinations.

Some aircraft will be allowed to depart the base and be relocated so that pilots can continue with their training, but air traffic in and out of Naval Air Station Jacksonville is effectively closed until the plane is removed from the river, Connor said.

The NTSB investigators are still deciding when and how to relocate the plane off the base, which would require the use of a barge.

""How the aircraft is positioned now certainly gives you limitations on a good thorough assessment,"" said NTSB investigator John Lovell. ""We are not aware of the extent of the damage under the waterline because it can't be seen.""

All fuel needs to be removed before the plane can be moved, and that effort was complicated by the aircraft being partially submerged in the river, as well as stormy weather on Sunday, Landsberg said.

"Hills, hawks and animals on the path to the Tails & Trails half-marathon","Buy Photo Herb Wills, running column. (Photo: Democrat files)

On the east side of Tallahassee, Tom Brown Park, Lafayette Heritage Park, and the Alford Greenway are connected by dozens if not hundreds of miles of trails. Charlie Johnson covered 13.1 miles on those trails in 1:25:32 to win the half-marathon at the 18th annual Tails & Trails on Saturday morning, May 4. Amanda Sava was the first woman in the race, defending her 2018 title in the half marathon with a 1:38:43 and placing seventh overall.

The Animal Shelter Foundation has always hosted the event, starting in 2002 with a 5K race, adding a 10K in 2006 and the half marathon in 2015. Two days before the 2019 Tails & Trails, the longest run was in peril.

“I got a call from the city on Thursday at 4:30,” said Tom Perkins. “There was a hawk attacking people in Lafayette Heritage Park. We were going to have to cancel the race or re-route it.”

It turned out that a very minor change of course satisfied the hawk’s territorial instincts, and the half-marathon started from the Animal Shelter as scheduled at 7:45 a.m., with Jeff Nielsen guiding the runners on the lead bicycle. After the first minute of running, Charlie Johnson was already well ahead of the field. No one, athlete or irate bird, challenged Johnson for the rest of the race.

“I was hoping for a hawk attack,” said Johnson. “Anything to have some excitement out there. It helped to have Jeff Nielsen out there on the bicycle, telling me, ‘OK, there’s a big hill coming up.’”

There are numerous hills on the Tails & Trails half marathon course, which takes the runners in and out of the Lake Lafayette basin before finishing back at the Animal Shelter, atop the ridge that Easterwood Drive runs along. Amanda Sava also noticed those hills.

It was tough!” said Sava. “I ran a lot faster this year. I think I’m in better shape, but I ran a triathlon last week and my legs are still recovering. I’m happy with my race, though. I’ll probably take a little break after this.”

Behind Johnson’s winning 1:25:32, Brad Busboom took second in 1:32:31 and Andrew Theodore third in 1:36:47. Jack McDermott was the first master runner in the half marathon, placing fourth overall in 1:36:47.

Melissa Thompson finished runner-up to Sava in the women's standings, placing sixteenth overall in 1:52:26. Courtney Mason was the third woman and seventeenth overall in 1:53:19. Laura Reina was the first woman master and fifth female finisher, twentieth overall in 1:55:11.

The Tails & Trails 10K started at 8:30, when the fastest half marathon runners were still exploring the Alford Greenway. Pensacola, Florida master runner Jennifer McGranahan was not only the first woman in the race, she was also the overall winner. McGranahan grabbed the lead right after the start, shadowed by Sean Landeta of Thomasville, Georgia. Landeta hung on for the first half of the race, but McGranahan got away after the leaders had turned around for the return trip to the Animal Shelter. 50 meters ahead by the six-kilometer mark, McGranahan finished with a lead of nearly 200 meters and a winning time of 46:08.

“That was fun!” said McGranahan. “I’ll be out there next year. I liked everything that went into this race; the trails, the family discount, the animals. It’s a nice way to find good homes for some animals.”

McGranahan has deep running roots in Pensacola, having raced cross-country and track for Pensacola High before going on to compete for the University of Florida. Currently, she’s working on a degree in physical therapy at Florida A&M University.

“I usually run the Fiesta of Five Flags 10K in Pensacola, and I could have driven back for that,” said McGranahan. “But I thought, ‘No!’ I love Tom Brown Park and the trails.”

Sean Landeta was the first man in the race, coming in second overall in 46:57. Paul Guyas was the first male master, third overall in 47:12. Master runner Tim Unger was third on the men's side and fifth overall in 48:40.

Tim Unger is Lilli Unger’s father, and Lilli Unger was second in the women’s standings.The Leon High cross-country runner placed fourth overall in 47:54. Alyssa Terry finished third in the women's division and seventh overall in 50:04.

The Tails & Trails 5K started at the same time as the 10K. Kurt Dietrich took the early lead in the 3.1-mile race. Having won the 5K in 2017 and 2018, Dietrich was going for a third straight title, but Connor Edwards denied him that. Edwards, an eighth-grader at Swift Creek Middle School, overtook Dietrich then went on to win the race in 19:44. Dietrich was second in 20:00, and Daniel Wurgler third in 20:14. Aaron Guyer was the top master runner in the 5K, placing seventh overall in 21:06.

In the 2015 Tails & Trails 10K Brittney Barnes had been the first woman. In the 2016 Tails & Trails 5K Barnes had been the first woman. In the 2019 5K she was again the first woman, placing ninth overall in 21:38. Amelia Bryant was second to Barnes, placing thirteenth overall in 25:10. Twelve-year-old Liliana Lewis edged Paula O'Neill for the third spot in the women's standings, 25:47 to 25:49. The two were sixteenth and seventeenth overall. O'Neill was the first woman master in the race.

643 athletes crossed the finish line at the 2019 Tails & Trails, with 125 completing the half marathon, 148 the 10K, 302 the 5K, and 68 the one-mile fun run. Gulf Winds Track Club of Tallahassee chip-timed each of the four races.

Woman found with alleged arcade-scamming device in St. Lucie County,"CLOSE If you see a crime being committed, leave anonymous tips with Treasure Coast Crime Stoppers. GINNY BEAGAN/TCPALM April 2019 Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

ST. LUCIE COUNTY — A woman was arrested after St. Lucie County Sheriff’s investigators said they found her with an electronic device that apparently helped her scam arcade machines out of money, according to an affidavit.

Karolyn Griffith (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY ST. LUCIE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE)

Karolyn Griffith, 30, of Sanford, was arrested May 3 on charges related to grand theft, fraud and giving false information to a law enforcement officer.

Deputies about 3:15 a.m. went to the Gold Rush arcade in the 6600 block of South U.S. 1 and spoke to Griffith, who investigators say tried to hide “a black electronic box with a red button and an antenna,” an affidavit states.

An employee said Griffith was winning too much money and it didn’t make sense.

The employee said Griffith and two others were there at the time, with “all acting like they did not know each other.” Griffith and a man occasionally changed between machines.

Investigators tested the device that Griffith had. A deputy switched on the device and was able to add credits to one of the machines.

The amount of money missing from the two machines totaled nearly $2,800.

Griffith was taken to the St. Lucie County jail, but it could not be determined Monday whether she had been released on bail.

The new land will center around the existing Guardians of the Galaxy ride– Mission: BREAKOUT! and move into the adjacent space that is currently occupied by “a bug’s land.” “It’s Tough to Be a Bug,” which closed on March 19.

Expansion plans are also underway at Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland. They will all be connected, the blog explained.

""These three new areas will champion the next generation of Super Heroes.""

BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s health minister is proposing fines for parents of school-age children who haven’t been vaccinated for measles amid concern that the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease could make a comeback.

In an interview published Sunday with German weekly Bild am Sonntag, minister Jens Spahn said parents who can’t prove their children have been vaccinated for measles should have to pay up to 2,500 euros ($2,790).

The minister also proposed that children without measles vaccinations be banned from going to daycare facilities, to protect others who are too young or medically unable to receive a measles immunization.

Compulsory medical procedures, including vaccinations, are a politically sensitive issue in Germany and it’s unclear whether Spahn’s proposal, which has yet to be discussed by Cabinet, will be implemented.

But worries that a disease once thought under control could re-emerge as a major threat has experts calling for vaccinations to be stepped up. The head of the German Medical Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, on Sunday welcomed Spahn’s proposal, telling Germany’s RND media group that it was “an important step at the right time.”

Germany had 203 reported cases of measles in the first 10 weeks of 2019, more than twice as many as in the same period last year but fewer than in 2017. Neighboring Switzerland last week reported two adult deaths from measles this year: one in an unvaccinated man of about 30 and another in a man of about 70 whose immune system had been compromised by cancer.

Experts generally say if more than 95% of the population is properly immunized, measles cannot spread easily and is effectively contained. But pockets of unvaccinated children or adults can cause flare-ups, as has recently been the case in the United States , which has over 700 cases this year in an outbreak that has not been halted.

According to the World Health Organization, Europe as a whole had 82,596 cases of measles last year and 72 measles deaths. Most of those infections — 53,218 — were recorded in Ukraine, where an armed conflict with separatists is hurting medical care in its eastern regions.

Popular European tourist destinations such as France and Italy had more than 2,400 measles cases each from March 2018 to February 2019, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, an EU agency. Greece had more than 1,400 measles cases and Britain reported over 900 during that time.",https://www.wfla.com/national/germany-threatens-to-fine-parents-who-don-t-get-their-children-vaccinated-against-measles/1981214583,2019-05-05T21:17:11Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"

"Florida Man Accused of Torturing, Abusing 2-Year-Old Girl","A Florida man is behind bars after he allegedly abused a 2-year-old girl in Escambia County.

According to NBC affiliate WPMI, Andrew Bennett Ross-Celaius is facing child abuse charges, among many others.

The man is accused of torturing the girl for months, treating her like a dog and even shooting her with an airsoft gun while sleeping.

“Our abuser would wear a mask, a werewolf mask, and the collar the chief described is a tasing collar for dogs,” said Sheriff Morgan of Escambia County.

Officials said that most of the abuse was recorded on cell phone video.

Deputies said the child’s mother, who happened to be the suspect’s girlfriend, had no idea.

She took the victim to the hospital for a case of ringworm that doctors determined to be burn marks.

“In some instances, it’s indescribable,” said Chief Deputy Simmons. “It’s the thing that nightmares are made of and no child should ever be subjected to his.”

WPMI found court records indicating that Ross-Celaius was charged with murder in the 2006 killing of 2-year-old Kyler Janes. Court records showed that Ross-Celaius was not found guilty.

In this latest case, Ross-Celaius is being held in jail without bond.

“We are comforted to some degree by the thought that this precious child will not be harmed tonight,” said a police official.

Deputies went on to say that Ross-Celaius called a friend from jail and had him destroy cell phone evidence of more abuse.

Eric Furnans was arrested and charged for destroying evidence.

In addition to six counts of aggravated child abuse, Ross-Celaius is being charged with probation violation, possession of a weapon, marijuana possession, four counts of child abuse, three counts of possession of a controlled substance and more.",http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/national-international/Its-Indescribable-Man-Accused-of-Torturing-Abusing-2-Year-Old-Girl-509491131.html,2019-05-04T19:19:32Z,NBC Bay Area,"n, 3534 W Touhy Ave, Skokie, IL 60076, USA"

"April 2007, News-Press archive; Shark bites man near Naples hotel","A bull shark was blamed for an April 2007 attack on a man in Collier County. (Photo: News-Press archive)

This story was originally published in The News-Press May 7, 2007

In the first shark attack since April 2006, a man was bitten Tuesday off a Naples beach.

Hans Pruss was swimming about 100 yards offshore from the Edgewater Beach Hotel when he felt something bump him on the left leg.

He swam to shore and saw a circular bite beginning just above the left knee and extending to mid-thigh.

""He was not in critical condition,"" hotel spokeswoman Courtney Giammaria said. ""After the incident, he swam to shore, and we made a call to emergency services.""

Emergency personal said the bite was probably caused by a 6- to 8-foot shark.

Pruss was taken to Naples Community Hospital.

A single shark incident doesn't mean Southwest Florida will see a ""Jaws""-like spate of shark attacks, said Bob Hueter, director of Mote Marine Laboratory's Center for Shark Research.

""If you look at the statistics, you'll see that shark attacks are rare in Florida and exceedingly rare in Collier and Lee counties,"" he said. ""It's such a statistical fluke that there's no reason to expect it will happen again any time soon.""

Original reports said the animal was a bull shark.

""I'd caution everybody that we don't know that it was a bull shark -- it sounds like speculation,"" Hueter said. ""It could have been a bull, blacktip or lemon.""

Although the incident is technically a shark attack, it was not a case of a shark seeking humans to eat.

""This is starting to look like the kind of shark bite when a shark sees something in the water and checks it out to see if it's suitable prey,"" Hueter said. ""It takes one bite, realizes it's the wrong thing and is gone. Unfortunately, it's going to cause a nasty wound.""

This is the eighth confirmed unprovoked shark attack in Collier County since 1882, the most recent in April 2006.

There have been five unprovoked shark attacks in Lee County in that same time period, and no shark attack in either Lee or Collier county has been fatal.

The most recent shark attack in Lee County was July 1, 2005, when a young Austrian tourist was bitten on the right ankle.

Florida leads the nation in shark attacks with 544 -- 13 have been fatal.

In recent years, most shark incidents have involved surfers: Of the 167 people bitten by sharks during the 1990s in Florida, 113 were surfers.

Lee County can be a particularly sharky place at this time of year: Mote scientists have documented that at least 13 shark species, including bulls, blacktips, lemons and great hammerheads, use the Charlotte Harbor system as a nursery area during the summer.

At this time of year, blacktip, bull, hammerhead, blacknose and lemon sharks are migrating along the Southwest Florida coast.

Despite the numbers of sharks in the area, people shouldn't be afraid to go in the water, Hueter said.

""On a practical level: Be cautious,"" Hueter said. ""Follow the basic guidelines when swimming in the ocean. Swim where lifeguards are at the beaches. Don't panic and think something is going on out there.""

Reducing risk of shark attack

•Always stay in groups since sharks are more likely to attack a solitary individual.

•Do not wander too far from shore -- this isolates an individual and places one far away from assistance.

•Avoid being in the water during darkness or twilight hours when sharks are most active and have a competitive sensory advantage.

•Do not enter the water if bleeding from an open wound or if menstruating -- a shark's olfactory ability is acute.

•Wearing shiny jewelry is discouraged because the reflected light resembles the sheen of fish scales.

•Avoid waters with known effluents or sewage and those used by sport or commercial fisherman, especially if there are signs of bait fishes or feeding activity. Diving seabirds are good indicators of such action.

•Sightings of porpoises do not indicate the absence of sharks -- both often eat the same food items.

•Use extra caution when waters are murky and avoid uneven tanning and bright colored clothing -- sharks see contrast particularly well.

•Refrain from excess splashing and do not allow pets in the water because of their erratic movements.

•Exercise caution when occupying the area between sandbars or near steep dropoffs -- these are favorite hangouts for sharks.

•Do not enter the water if sharks are known to be present, and evacuate the water if sharks are seen while there. And, of course, do not harass a shark if you see one!

‘Who’s going to take care of these people?’,"The hospital had already transferred out most of its patients and lost half its staff when the CEO called a meeting to take inventory of what was left. Employees crammed into Tina Steele’s office at Fairfax Community Hospital, where the air conditioning was no longer working and the computer software had just been shut off for nonpayment.

“I want to start with good news,” Steele said, and she told them a food bank would make deliveries to the hospital and Dollar General would donate office supplies.

“So how desperate are we?” one employee asked. “How much money do we have in the bank?”

“Somewhere around $12,000,” Steele said.

“And how long will that last us?”

“Under normal circumstances?” Steele asked. She looked down at a chart on her desk and ran calculations in her head. “Probably a few hours,” she said. “Maybe a day at most.”

The staff had been fending off closure hour by hour for the past several months, ever since debt for the 15-bed hospital surpassed $1 million and its outside ownership group entered into bankruptcy, beginning a crisis in Fairfax that is becoming familiar across much of rural America. More than 100 of the country’s remote hospitals have gone broke and then closed in the past decade, turning some of the most impoverished parts of the United States into what experts now call “health-hazard zones,” and Fairfax was on the verge of becoming the latest. The emergency room was down to its final four tanks of oxygen. The nursing staff was out of basic supplies such as snakebite antivenin and strep tests. Hospital employees had not received paychecks for the past 11 weeks and counting.

The only reason the hospital had been able to stay open at all was that about 30 employees continued showing up to work without pay, increasing their hours to fill empty shifts and essentially donating time to the hospital, understanding what was at stake. Some of them had been born or had given birth at Fairfax Community. Several others had been stabilized and treated in the emergency room after heart attacks or accidents. There was no other hospital within 30 miles of two-lane roads and prairie in sprawling Osage County, which meant Fairfax Community was the only lifeline in a part of the country that increasingly needed rescuing.

“If we aren’t open, where do these people go?” asked a physician assistant, thinking about the dozens of patients he treated each month in the ER, including some in critical condition after drug overdoses, falls from horses, oil field disasters or car crashes.

“They’ll go to the cemetery,” another employee said. “If we’re not here, these people don’t have time. They’ll die along with this hospital.”

“We have no supplies,” Steele said. “We have nothing. How much longer can we provide quality care?”

James Graham, with 41 years as a primary care physician, is the longest-serving member of the Fairfax Community Hospital staff.

Everyone in the room turned, as they often did, to the longest-serving member of the hospital staff James Graham, 67. He had worked as a primary care physician at Fairfax Community for 41 years, writing his cellphone number atop new prescriptions, making rounds while on dialysis through two kidney transplants, and sometimes hand-delivering medication to indigent patients out the window of his pickup truck. For much of his career, he had been on call as the only doctor in a town where the need for medical care continued to rise: Childhood poverty climbing up above 30 percent. Accidental deaths doubling in the past decade. Increasing rates of diabetes, heart disease, drug addiction and obesity.

Graham had been an honorary pallbearer at more than 160 of his patients’ funerals, watching the cemetery expand as Fairfax’s population declined from almost 2,000 to fewer than 1,300 through 40 years of attrition. The hospital remained the area’s largest employer, and the town had sunk more than half of its annual budget into legal fees to file a lawsuit against the hospital’s ownership company, hoping to retake control of Fairfax Community. There was still a chance the town could save the hospital in some form by partnering with a new management company, if the bankruptcy court would allow it. Fairfax’s vice mayor had promised employees he would come by at the end of the week to deliver an update, and possibly even paychecks if new management could be found.

“Maybe we’ll get good news,” Graham told the staff. “But we’re holding out for a miracle, and if some of you can’t afford to keep waiting and working for free, you can walk away now and nobody will blame you.”

He looked around the room as his co-workers stood in place. A call came over the hospital’s intercom. “Medical assistance up front,” a receptionist said. Graham waited for another second, until the silence sounded to him like a decision.

“Okay,” he said, moving toward the emergency room. “Let’s keep the doors open until someone tells us we can’t.”

In many a rural community, the struggling local hospital is the sole source of health care for many miles around.

RIGHT: A tip collection at Treat's Coffee in Fairfax symbolizes the financial crisis that has gripped the rural Oklahoma hospital and many similar facilities across the United States.

The hospital was the first building on the winding road into Fairfax, positioned atop the only hill in town, and for 65 years it had served a county that was larger in area than a few U.S. states. Patients came from all over Northern Oklahoma, traveling through cattle farms and across rolling prairie, sometimes driving up to an hour to reach their closest full-service hospital. It was a single-story building about the size of an average elementary school. An American flag flew above the open doorway into the main lobby, where the reception staff greeted most patients by first name on sight.

“A small community is only as healthy as its hospital,” read one sign near the entrance, but lately, that relationship in Fairfax and hundreds of other small towns had gone from symbiotic to ominous. Rural America needed more emergency care than ever before. Its hospitals were less equipped than ever to provide it.

In the past decade, emergency room visits to America’s more than 2,000 rural hospitals increased by more than 60 percent, even as those hospitals began to collapse under doctor shortages and historically low operating margins. Hospitals like Fairfax Community treat patients that are on average six years older and 40 percent poorer than those in urban hospitals, which means rural hospitals have suffered disproportionately from government cuts to Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates. They also treat a higher percentage of uninsured patients, resulting in unpaid bills and rising debts. A record 46 percent of rural hospitals lost money last year. More than 400 are classified by health officials as being at “high risk of imminent failure.” Hundreds more have cut services or turned over control to outside ownership groups in an attempt to stave off closure.

Driving in Fairfax, Graham passes shuttered businessess, silent markers of the towns steady decline.

Fairfax Community had survived a previous bankruptcy in 2011 and then passed through four outside ownership groups before being purchased in 2016 by EmpowerHMS, a Florida company that operated more than a dozen rural hospitals across the Midwest. The company promoted itself as “a savior for struggling rural hospitals,” but within months of taking over, its corporate office had begun defaulting on some of Fairfax Community’s bills and cutting its spending budget. Eventually, four of the company’s hospitals had shut down and nine more had entered bankruptcy, including Fairfax. It could no longer afford to provide X-rays or CT scans. No more remote monitoring for patients with irregular heartbeats. No more blood tests.

And now in came Dr. Graham, a day after the staff meeting, walking up to Steele in the hallway and waving another overdue bill.

“I hate to add another problem to your list, but this is a big one,” he said, handing her a letter. It said his malpractice insurance was three months overdue. He had 15 days to pay a minimum of $1,000 on the balance, or he would lose his insurance and his legal right to practice medicine in Oklahoma.

“Does it ever end?” Steele asked. She looked at the letter and thought about the hospital’s diminishing reserves in comparison to its mounting debts: $14,000 for overdue lab tests, $22,000 for leased machines, $9,000 for electrocardiogram readings, $70,000 owed to staffing companies and more than $600,000 in overdue payroll. In the billing office, there was a stack of certified letters and at least one lawsuit from a vendor demanding its money.

“I’m really no good to you without this,” Graham said. “You might as well let me walk out and retire.”

“I’ll take care of it,” Steele said. “We can’t do much without you.”

Graham had been talking about retiring for a few years, but he was one of just two physicians at the hospital, and he didn’t want to abandon his patients. He had tried recruiting his own replacement, but there was a doctor shortage of nearly 40,000 physicians across rural America, and he couldn’t find anyone willing to relocate to Fairfax. He’d tried mentoring promising students at Oklahoma’s medical schools, but they eventually chose to practice in bigger cities. He’d even tried submitting his resignation paperwork in 2018, selling his farmhouse, and moving 20 miles into the country with his wife, but his patients kept calling his cellphone, and there was no one else to treat them, so he continued returning to Fairfax to make rounds a few times each week.

The past 40 years had turned him into a seasoned generalist, accustomed to treating whatever emergency came through the hospital’s doors. One day it was a mother who’d gone into labor on a nearby road. The next it might be a critical gunshot wound, or an allergic reaction to a bee sting, or a panic attack, or a child with a cockroach stuck in his ear, or a pill seeker trying to hustle the ER out of pain medication in the middle of the night. “The ER doesn’t have a routine,” Graham liked to say, and for much of his career that uncertainty thrilled him, but now he felt something different whenever a new patient rushed in, a sensation closer to dread. “Do we have the supplies left to help these people?” he wondered.

A woman arrived with what appeared to be a broken arm, but there was no working X-ray machine to confirm it. “We have to sling it and send you on to Tulsa,” a nurse told her.

A child came in with his leg gashed in a fishing injury, but the hospital had run out of the correct-size thread to stitch it up. “This one will work just as well,” a nurse said, returning with a different-size thread from the emptying supply closet.

The doors opened again, and this time it was Cassie Fessler and her 16-year-old son, an elite high school basketball player who was bent over in the hospital lobby, complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. His face looked pale. “My chest feels like it could explode,” he said, and two nurses took his vital signs while a lab technician attached electrodes to his chest to test his heartbeat and then immediately sent the results to a pediatric cardiologist in Tulsa.

Fessler paced the hospital hallway, and after a few minutes, Graham stepped out to walk with her. “Real sorry you’re dealing with all this,” he said.

“I saw your truck when we pulled up here and almost cried,” she said. “Thank God you were here.”

Graham had pronounced the death of Fessler’s grandfather at the nursing home 35 years earlier. He had worked with her mother, a nurse, and he had been Fessler’s primary care doctor for the past 40 years. The hospital had saved her 2-year-old daughter after she was stomped by a horse; it had treated another of her sons for acute cardiac distress. Now Graham told Fessler that her son’s heartbeat looked abnormal on the test. Fairfax Community didn’t employ any specialists trained in pediatric cardiology, and it no longer had money to pay for remote cardiac monitoring.

“We can helicopter him over to Tulsa in less than 25 minutes, and a cardiologist will be waiting,” Graham told Fessler, as she signed a few forms. “That’s really the best thing for him.”

Graham had heard doctors in Tulsa refer to Oklahoma’s rural hospitals as Band-Aid stations, places that offered a temporary salve before sending patients along to bigger hospitals for better care. The term was meant to be demeaning, but Graham sometimes used it with pride, because the temporary solutions at Fairfax Community were emergency blood transfusions, chest tubes, intubations, overdose reversals and several helicopter flights each month that saved people’s lives.

The helicopter landed behind the hospital, and two paramedics loaded the 16-year-old onto a stretcher to put him aboard. Fessler rushed to her car to drive 90 minutes to the hospital in Tulsa, since there wasn’t room for her in the helicopter. Graham watched as the helicopter lifted off, the thunder of its rotor shaking the hospital windows, and then he took out his phone.

“Hi, Cassie?” he shouted. “You drive safe, okay?”

The ER emptied out. The hallways went quiet. The daytime staff went home, and what remained of Fairfax Community were two inpatients asleep in their rooms and a few nurses arriving for another overnight shift without pay.

“Well guys, Jamie and Katie just quit,” announced Donna Renfro, the head of nursing, coming into the staff room wearing sweatpants, slippers and a sweatshirt on what was supposed to be her night off. She had worked 150 hours in the past two weeks, but now the hospital’s staff had decreased by two more, and there was no one left to work the shift. “It’s just us,” she said, speaking to the entirety of the hospital’s remaining nursing staff, three nurses and three aides.

“I can’t exactly blame anyone for quitting,” said Karen Cook, an aide. “We’re probably the crazy ones, sitting up here every night, volunteering.”

“We’re going to have to start pulling 16 hours instead of 12,” Renfro said, looking at the upcoming staff schedule, where the same six names kept repeating. “I’m sorry, but I can’t see any way around it.”

“I’m guessing pay will stay the same?” Cook asked. She laughed and then went quiet. She was the primary earner in her family, and now she was running a tab at the grocery store and relying on friends to help pay bills. “I ride for the team,” she said. “Don’t matter what you need. I’ll be here.”

“You know I’m never leaving,” said Julia Smith, who had been born at the hospital and worked as a nurse’s aide for 38 years, earning $10.14 an hour.

“My parents say they’ll disown me if I quit,” said Monica Woods, a nurse at Fairfax for

18 years. Her mother had worked at the hospital for 32 years, and her father had been saved twice in the ER. “They can’t live here if there’s no hospital,” she said. “I’m going down with all of you.”

They were bound together by the lonely rhythms of a midnight ER, where on some nights they treated 10 patients and on other nights saw none. They sometimes took turns using the treadmill in physical therapy, watched movies or traded off smoking breaks to kill time, right up until the ER doors swung open after an overdose or a car wreck and they were suddenly administering CPR. “Why does it always have to be either insanely busy or dead?” Woods asked, at the start of a dead night, watching the clock until a call came in from Room 218.

“Everything all right in there?” Woods asked.

“Oh, I’m sorry,” said Carolyn Long, 76, one of the hospital’s two remaining inpatients. “I must have hit that button by mistake. Didn’t mean to bother you.”

“No bother at all, Mrs. Long. I’ll come right in.”

She was reclining in her hospital bed under a knit blanket, flipping channels on an old RCA television and forcing down another bottle of the vanilla smoothie that nurses delivered every few hours to help her gain weight. The entire staff at Fairfax Community called her Mrs. Long, because she’d taught most of them at the local middle school before retiring after 35 years. Now she’d been in Room 218 for two weeks, working with the physical therapist as she recovered from a blood clot in her heart. One of her assignments was to walk up and down the hallway, where she stopped every few steps to catch her breath and overheard snippets from the hospital staff. The lab was down from four employees to one. A technician had gone $100,000 into debt after having an emergency preterm birth, because none of the hospital’s employees had benefits or insurance.

Long had lived in Fairfax all of her adult life, and like most people in town, she felt some ownership over the hospital. She had given birth down the hall. She had watched both of her in-laws receive last rites in a room next door. Her husband’s construction company had poured the concrete for the helipad. She had served on the hospital’s community board in the 1970s and ’80s, when the hospital was ranked by state health officials as one of the best rural health facilities in Oklahoma, offering obstetrics, elective surgeries and a cadre of specialists who drove out from Tulsa for consultations each week. But then the oil fields dried up, costing the town most of its best jobs. Farming suffered through a drought, and Fairfax’s property valuations began a steady decline. Now, many shops on Main Street were boarded up, and the pharmacy had moved 30 miles to Ponca City. The school district had consolidated and gone to a four-day week to save money, and the middle school where Long spent her career was scheduled to close for good at the end of the year.

She’d tried to help Fairfax Community again from her hospital bed, asking friends to make donations. The town had established a general fund to help hospital employees pay their electricity bills. One rancher had come to the hospital with $1,000 checks for every remaining employee.

“How are all of you hanging in?” Long asked, when Woods stopped into her room.

“Isn’t that supposed to be my question?” Woods said, but she smiled and sat down for a minute anyway. “They’re telling us we might get paychecks tomorrow. If not, more people will quit.”

“How many people do you need to run a hospital?” Long asked.

“We’re going to find out.”

Signs of economic distress in the town that is home to Fairfax Community Hospital. The population has fallen from 2,000 to 1,300 in recent years.

Another morning, another staff meeting to see who was left.

“Do we still have dietary?” Dr. Graham asked.

“She just put in her notice,” said Steele, the CEO.

“How about receptionists?” Graham asked.

“If we get paychecks today, they’re staying,” Steele said. “If not, they’re gone as of this afternoon.”

“Guess we’ll wait and see what happens,” Graham said. The town’s vice mayor was coming in a few hours to deliver news about the future of the hospital, but rather than sit and wait, Graham walked out to his truck to take a drive through town. It was a flat, square-mile grid with no stoplight, and he knew almost every house and the traumas that had occurred inside.

He drove away from the hospital and into the adjacent neighborhood, passing the first home, with a collapsed front porch and windows blown out by a tornado. “I sat with that lady as she died four years ago, and now this house just rots away,” he said. He turned onto another block and drove past a bungalow where the owner had died of lung cancer at 58. Next was a suspected drug overdose. Next was a midnight heart attack in the bathroom, and Graham had checked for a pulse and then stayed to pray with the new widower until his children came from Wichita.

His cellphone rang, and he pulled over to answer it. “Hey, bud,” he said, and he listened as a patient described a pain that was rising from his stomach to his chest. “Trust me. I know history on you,” he said. “This medication can help, but it might make your depression worse. Make sure you go up there and see the counselors, all right?”

He hung up and continued down the block, past a house that had belonged to a young married couple. “I might have delivered both of them,” Graham said, and he’d remained their doctor until a few years earlier, when the husband shot and killed his wife in a domestic dispute and police shot the husband. They rushed him to Fairfax Community in critical condition, and Graham had been trying to drain fluid from his heart when he died on the operating table.

He rolled down his window and turned onto Main Street, where redbud trees bloomed outside abandoned storefronts, and his cellphone rang again. Another patient. More chronic pain. “I’ll call in a refill at the pharmacy,” he said. “Remember now, those old boys can’t just trust anybody these days. Make sure to bring your identification.”

Wild horses graze on the prairie near Fairfax. The community hospital serves a large rural area, with no other medical center within 30 miles by road.

He’d been offered easier jobs in Tulsa for better pay, but he’d grown up in another poor town with too few doctors, learning medicine as a teenager by administering his mother’s dialysis. Rural Oklahoma was down to one doctor for every 1,700 people, compared with one for every 400 nationally, and Graham had tried to compensate by opening a clinic downtown and treating uninsured patients free each month at a local church. He’d seen more than 10,000 patients over the course of his career, starting each new appointment with the same rule. “I can’t help unless you give me the truth,” Graham told his patients, and their truths were often depression, addiction, obesity, diabetes or lung disease.

He drove past the cemetery, where he’d buried his mother after treating her for kidney failure and his stepfather after treating him for lung cancer. He continued down a hill and idled for a minute in front of his ex-wife’s home, newly empty after she died three weeks earlier of unknown causes at age 62.

“I’m so sick of watching people die,” he said. “I keep trying to get out from under death, and I can’t do it. Who’s going to take care of these people?”

He looked up the road and saw one of his patients seated at his refinery business, 82 years old and still working full-time at a business that had shrunk over the years from 40 employees down to three. “What do you know?” Graham asked, pulling over to say hello, and the man tried to stand up to greet him but fell back into his chair. He had a pinched nerve in his back and pain his hip. Graham had been trying to get him in to see a specialist in Tulsa, but he was still waiting for an appointment.

“What are you taking for pain?” Graham asked.

“Nothing. I didn’t want to bother nobody.”

“You can’t bother me,” Graham said. “I’ve known you 40 years and never seen you like this. Let me go get my script.”

Graham leaned against the hood of his truck and wrote another prescription to dull the pain of rural Oklahoma. “Are we just getting older, or are we all getting worse?” he said, and then a few minutes later his phone rang again. It was a nurse at the hospital. The vice mayor had finished his meeting with lawyers, and he was on his way to Fairfax Community to update the staff.

“I’ll be right there,” Graham said, and he tore off the prescription, handed it to his patient and drove back up the hill.

RIGHT: Hospital staffers are left shaken by the latest news about the effort to save the facility from permanent closure.

The original 60 employees on the hospital staff gathered in the main hallway. Some had already quit, others had stayed, and all of them were watching as the vice mayor walked through the door. Charlie Cartwright had his hands in his pockets, and he wasn’t carrying a bag. If he’d come with paychecks, they were still in his car. One employee knelt to pray. A few others slumped against the wall. “I’d rather not be here to see this,” Graham said, but he waited as Cartwright paced the center hallway, trying to compose himself.

“I promised myself I wasn’t going to come up here acting like a mess,” Cartwright said. His wife ran the hospital’s physical therapy department, and he had spent months fighting to get the hospital back under the town’s control.

“I wish I had better news, but I’m coming to you with a major problem here,” he said, and then he explained what he’d just learned from the lawyers. A bankruptcy court in North Carolina had retained control of the hospital, and it refused to give it back to the town. Another management group from Oklahoma had made a bid to operate the hospital, promising to restock supplies, issue paychecks and rehire at least some employees in an attempt to keep the hospital running, but any takeover was still weeks away. If the hospital closed even temporarily before then, state and federal laws would make reopening difficult, but Fairfax Community couldn’t afford to keep operating a full hospital, and the city had exhausted its budget on legal fees.

“We’re writing checks right now that our ass can’t cash,” Cartwright said.

The hospital doors swung open behind him. A man walked in complaining about a tick bite, still holding the tick. “Can someone tell me if this thing is going to give me Lyme disease?” he asked, and one of the staff members looked at the man’s arm as Cartwright continued.

He said he was aware of only one way for the hospital to survive until new management took over. “We become an empty shell,” he said. The hospital’s patients would have to be transferred out. All but a few employees would be laid off. Fairfax would close its hospital except for the ER, which would operate with minimal supplies and a skeleton staff — a nurse, an aide and a doctor on call.

“I need you all to tell me if this is what we want to do,” Cartwright said, and he looked over at Graham.

“It seems like the only way,” Graham said, and then he stepped into the center of the hallway to face the rest of the staff. “It’s been a big try, everybody,” he said. “Might not be over yet, and hopefully a lot of us will be back when this place changes hands. I know all of you want to help take care of these people. I know you’ll do it for free. You’ve proven that. But right now, the best thing a lot of us can do is go home. We’ll drop down to just an ER. We’ll take people’s vitals and send them on.”

“We’re a family,” said Renfro, the head nurse. “We’ll do whatever we have to.”

Employees hugged and began to clear out of the hallway as Fairfax Community emptied out. One inpatient was transferred to a nursing home. The other, Mrs. Long, was released into the care of a friend. The lab director locked the lab. The CEO shut off her computer. Graham walked to his truck and started dialing patients on his phone. “I’ll still be here,” he told them. “I’m always on call.”

He drove down the hill and away from the hospital, where life in a small town began and ended, and where on this night, what remained in the darkness were no patients, two nurses and a lighted red sign.

How Jim Harbaugh’s Michigan is now joining the spread offense world,"At Stanford, Jim Harbaugh appeared to be the reckoning for the spread offense. His Cardinal offenses promised to bring back power football, with tons of bruising blockers moving around to create a symphony of violence and smash-mouth football.

That was what Harbaugh offered to Michigan when he arrived for 2015: to bring back Bo Schembechler-style neanderball and get back to running over opponents.

2018 was Year 4 of the Harbaugh era. In a season-defining showdown with Ohio State, the Wolverines ran 37 times for a solid 177 yards (4.8 per carry) and two TDs. It didn’t stop them from losing 62-39 and seeing their Playoff hopes go up in smoke.

Harbaugh’s last offense at Stanford, 2010’s, finished No. 3 in S&P+. His Wolverines have struggled to put together an offensive line like that one, which yielded six sacks on Andrew Luck all season and produced multiple draft picks. They’ve also cycled through a different starting QB for all four seasons, and they haven’t finished better than 25th in S&P+.

But in 2018, Harbaugh started Michigan down a path that will transform the team in 2019 and beyond. The Wolverines are going to the RPO spread.

Harbaugh made a few substantial changes. They started with hiring run-game guru Ed Warriner as line coach and bringing in Ole Miss transfer QB Shea Pattesron.

Warriner brought a rich background with spread coaches over the last two decades, from Mark Mangino to Urban Meyer to P.J. Fleck. Harbaugh snatched him up to convert Michigan’s power run playbook into a simpler system built around inside zone.

They did exactly that, bumping Shea back into shotgun and pistol alignments so they could run zone-read plays, often from multiple-TE sets. Those sets let them create confusion, pick on different edge defenders, and often give Patterson an escort around the edge:

When defenses were aware enough, they often had their unblocked DE stay home so they could take their chances against the normal Wolverine zone running game, rather than give Patterson a chance to dart around the edge. After removing sack yardage (21 for 145 yards), Patterson finished the year with 55 carries for 418 yards at 7.6 ypc, with two rushing TDs. His backup, Dylan McCaffrey, also got in on the act in some of his snaps:

Similar concept, zone read, but with one of the TEs aligned to the other side of the formation before coming back and arcing around the edge for the QB keeper. By reading the Wisconsin outside linebacker, UM got the arcing TE matched up on a CB in the run game, and he drove the corner to the sideline to open up the lane for McCaffrey.

The Wolverines also mixed in a few RPOs for Patterson, but they didn’t make that their full-time approach. They maintained a collection of under-center formations and man and gap blocking run schemes to mix in with their bread and butter, inside zone.

Now, Harbaugh’s brought on Alabama WR coach Josh Gattis to run the offense. Expect the spread evolution to accelerate.

Gattis was a helpful architect of the Alabama RPO spread in 2018, when the Tide had one of the most efficient offenses in history and had defenses ceding all kinds of space.

Michigan’s spring game featured many of Alabama’s staple plays, including this backside slant pass option with some Wolverine personnel twists:

They’re in 21 personnel here, with a TE joining RB/FB hybrid Ben VanSumeren, in addition to a traditional RB. The RB runs a quick flat route to create a slant/flat combination on the backside while the FB is on a path to run outside zone to the other end of the formation.

The goal with RPOs is to make the defense worry about multiple skill players at the same time. This look gives the QB a sort of triple-option trigger that works backwards from pitch to handoff. RPOs work well from the spread but can also work from bigger personnel groups like this one. Essentially, Michigan is running an old-school outside zone play and a West Coast slant/flat route combination, like they might have done any other year. The difference is using a shotgun formation to run both plays at the same time.

No matter how Michigan organizes its personnel packages in real games, mixing in regular RPOs will play to Patterson’s strengths. It will also isolate Michigan’s offensive line against opposing fronts, once defenses back off to stop the quick passes.

Patterson’s first year wasn’t all Michigan could’ve hoped for when it picked him from the wreckage of Ole Miss. His line was a big part of the problem.

It allowed a modest 21 sacks of Patterson, but those included three against both Notre Dame and Ohio State and five against Florida in the Peach Bowl. When the Wolverines faced better defensive ends, their tackles were exposed and their offense had to play with a governor.

The scare with the spread is if Michigan’s tackles can hold up without extra blockers to help. At left tackle, they had to ask John Runyan Jr. to hold things down for them. Runyan is quick, but he was limited by his size at 6’3, 310 pounds. He’ll be back as a redshirt senior and paired with either third-year Andrew Steuber (6’6, 320) or fresheman Jalen Mayfield (6’5, 300) at right tackle. Both are more prototypical tackles, but they’re still green.

But the interior line should be able to maul teams that don’t pack the box with defenders. Center Cesar Ruiz flashed brilliance as a true sophomore in 2018. To Ruiz’s left, he’ll have a fourth-year starter (6’5, 232-pound Ben Bredeson). To Ruiz’s right, he’ll have another massive returning starter (6’3, 350-pound Michael Onwenu). When they’re able to execute double teams on DTs while edge defenders are accounted for with option reads, the Wolverines can pound the ball between the tackles like Harbaugh’s always preferred:

The safety dropping down into the box late made an impressive play to get the tackle there. Without his addition, the Gators were looking at potential catastrophe.

Building around inside zone makes for an easier track to developing consistently good OL at the college level. The rules remain consistent across positions, and players can be moved around more easily to get the best five on the field. That’s a primary reason that inside zone is typically the favorite building block of spread run games like Michigan’s building. It poses risks if Michigan’s tackles don’t improve in pass protection, however.

Harbaugh had a unique approach to college offense when he got to Michigan. He was zigging as the sport zagged.

While the sport shifted toward the spread, Harbaugh kept emphasizing under-center formations, fullbacks, and tight ends. The spread approach now is becoming much more uniform and, judging by hires like Gattis, increasingly seen as “best practices.”

Michigan has mostly been able to defeat less talented teams for years. The question is whether this change makes a difference against Notre Dame or Ohio State.

But there’s reason to be hopeful. If the Wolverines can start to develop tackles more consistently and integrate their skilled hybrids at FB and TE into the RPO game, they can gain an extra gear.",https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2019/5/9/18525329/michigan-offense-2019-josh-gattis-jim-harbaugh-shea-patterson,2019-05-09T08:42:43Z,SBNation.com,"1201 Connecticut Avenue NW 11th Floor Washington, DC 20036"
Garden State South: Why Clemson University has so many students from New Jersey,"If you had to guess the top states sending students to Clemson University, the first three would be easy. South Carolina, Georgia and North Carolina are predictable. Try your hand at No. 4, though, and you might get thrown off.

It's the Garden State.

There were more undergraduates at Clemson from New Jersey than from Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Michigan and Missouri combined in 2019.

The number of undergraduates from New Jersey has grown steadily in recent years from 460 in 2013 to 570 this year, making it the fourth-highest state of origin for students according to data from the Office of Institutional Research.

Virginia comes in at No. 5 with 498 students among the 19,650 undergraduates at Clemson.

The University of South Carolina has seen similar growth in enrollment from New Jersey. An estimated 300 new students from New Jersey will start at the University of South Carolina in the fall, an increase of about 6% from the fall of 2017. Applications from New Jersey to the University of South Carolina were up about 28% from 2017, said Jeff Stensland, the university's director of public relations.

For UofSC students who started in fall 2016, the most recent class for which the school has data in its online Fact Book, the top feeder states were South Carolina, then North Carolina, New Jersey and Virginia.

South Carolina schools are not alone in drawing students from New Jersey. The Garden State continually ranks first for net migration of students. In 2016, 32,014 students left New Jersey for college while only 4,496 students entered the state for a net loss of 27,518 students — the highest net loss in the country, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Other states do not send as many students out of state because they have bigger scholarships and programs to keep students in-state, said Clemson director of admissions David Kuskowski. For example, Texas guarantees admission to state schools for the top 10% of all graduating students, and Clemson has only 181 students from Texas.

For seven years straight, New York native and New Jersey resident John Kennington has had one of his kids at Clemson. His oldest daughter wanted to go south for college and fell in love with the Clemson political science and honors programs when she visited. His middle daughter transferred to Clemson and will graduate this week. Ceremonies are today and Friday and Kennington is flying in for the festivities.

For both, he saw going out of state for college as a chance for them to ""spread their wings.""

""New Jersey schools didn't impress us,"" Kennington said.

Kennington knew that even in-state tuition would be relatively steep, and he felt a school like Clemson offered ""bigger bang for your buck."" In-state tuition, room and board at Rutgers University in New Jersey is $34,138, and Clemson's out-of-state total cost is about $49,352.

Kennington now serves on the Clemson Family Advisory Board and has stepped in to man a table for Clemson at college fairs in New Jersey.

Kuskowski has made three trips to New Jersey for student recruitment since starting at Clemson in 2017. While Kuskowski said Clemson is committed to keeping the student body at a 65-to-35% mix of in-state and out-of-state students, he also sees a geographic spread of students as important for diversity and varied perspectives.

In 2019, Clemson received undergraduate admissions applications from all 50 states, Kuskowski said.

Kuskowski hears a number of reasons for New Jersey students selecting Clemson, from escaping Northeastern winters to finding a place that is not across the country but still provides a chance to get away from home.

Kuskowski has also had students from the Northeast whose families traveled through South Carolina for vacations in places such as Myrtle Beach when they were kids, building fond memories of the state.

Jennifer Nuechterlein has seen a different connection to Clemson over her 11 years as the college and career counselor at Hunterdon Central Regional High School in New Jersey. It is a large, suburban school of about 3,000 students, and it has historically had the highest number of applications to Clemson from New Jersey.

In 2016, Nuechterlein had 17 students apply to Clemson. In 2017, 30 students applied.

Kuskowski said Clemson received 44 applications for the class of 2023 and accepted 25 students. Seven are planning to attend.

Nuechterlein, who has visited Clemson, said her students often like Clemson because they are used to a big school with a lot of spirit and active sports.

On May 1, Nuechterlein's students celebrated National College Decision Day. She said there was no shortage of orange in the building.

""The Carolinas are just a nice, healthy distance,"" Nuechterlein said.

Nuechterlein's students average eight to 10 college applications, and those applying to Clemson also tend to apply to the University of South Carolina and Virginia Tech, she said.

Part of the growth in applications to Clemson is because of word of mouth, Nuechterlein said. When the school has a well-known senior go to Clemson, it increases awareness of the college. Parents also spread the the word.

""Parents are sitting at baseball games and lacrosse games talking,"" said Nuechterlein, who had students go to 175 different colleges last year.

New Jersey native Mollie Hayes just finished her junior year as a political science and criminal justice student at Clemson. On Friday, May 3, she made the 11½-hour drive home.

When Hayes was visiting colleges while in high school, she added Clemson to her list only because she was stopping at UofSC. She ended up applying to two in-state schools upon her parents' request, but that was ""against her will.""

Hayes immediately loved the Clemson campus. She was accepted at both UofSC and Clemson, but her final choice came down to the University of Florida, her mom's alma mater, and Clemson.

Hayes now serves as a tour guide at Clemson, and she can tell when New Jersey schools are on spring break because she will see an influx of visitors from there.

During 2018, the Clemson visitors center saw 1,088 prospective students from New Jersey, with each typically bringing two to three family members, said visitors center director Tracey O'Kelley.

Among her peers at South Brunswick High School, Hayes was one of the students who went farthest away. When she got to campus, though, she ended up meeting others from across New Jersey.

Hayes is from Middlesex County, which has 15 Clemson students this year.

Two counties in New Jersey, Monmouth and Morris, each had more students attending Clemson this year than there were students from the entire state of Alabama. Monmouth County had 102, and Morris County had 76. The state of Alabama had 58.

Notably, both Monmouth and Morris have bigger populations than any South Carolina county. Greenville is the biggest Clemson feeder with 2,413 students at the school for the 2018 to 2019 year.

At 8.9 million residents, New Jersey has about 3.8 million more residents than South Carolina's 5.1 million, according to the United States Census Bureau. Alabama's population is approximately 4.9 million.

""Clemson was so under the radar for me from Jersey, but I came and found so many people here from the Northeast in general,"" Hayes said. ""Students from New York and New Jersey, we are all drawn to this small town in South Carolina.""

A Watergate burglar’s account of his crimes — and what it tells us about the Mueller probe indictments,"

James McCord and his lawyer Gerald Alch, right, are briefed by Sam Donaldson, second from left, and other members of the media outside the U.S. District Court in Washington on March 23, 1973. (Harry Naltchayan/The Washington Post)

Shane O’Sullivan is a documentary filmmaker, senior lecturer in filmmaking at Kingston University, London and author of the new book, “ Dirty Tricks: Nixon, Watergate and the CIA .""

When Watergate burglar James McCord died two years ago at the age of 93, his family wanted no obituary. So his death didn’t make national news until just a few weeks ago, when it was announced on the day the Mueller report was released. Given McCord’s pivotal role in bugging Democratic National Committee headquarters and exposing the Watergate coverup, the announcement couldn’t have been more timely.

Two years before his death, McCord shared a PowerPoint presentation with his family, revealing important details about his CIA career and his secret motivation for the break-in that were never revealed publicly. McCord’s final will and testament exposed a gulf between what he said in his Senate Watergate testimony and how he justified his actions to himself and his family before he died. As such, it provides a timely perspective on the gap between public testimony and personal motivations — something to keep in mind as we assess the statements of those indicted by grand jurors in the Mueller team investigation.

Facing a lengthy prison sentence for his part in the break-in and bugging of the Democratic National Committee, McCord wrote a letter to Judge John Sirica, who oversaw the trial of the Watergate burglars, in March 1973. The letter revealed senior campaign figures were involved in Watergate, exposing obstruction of justice in the upper echelons of the White House and leading to impeachment proceedings and the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

Like President Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen, McCord flipped. He refused to be the fall guy for the campaign chiefs who had approved the break-in or for the administration, which was falsely claiming it was a CIA operation.

“My motivations were different than those of the others involved,” McCord told Sirica, but his ulterior motive for the break-in was never fully explained until his final PowerPoint presentation. Titled “Watergate and the Gainesville 8,” it reveals the conservative political ideology which drove his involvement in Watergate. In it, McCord accuses Vietnam Veterans against the War (VVAW) — the antiwar veterans’ organization in which former secretary of state John F. Kerry was once a leading figure — of a terrorist plot to assassinate three hawkish U.S. senators and foment violence at the 1972 Republican convention. McCord claims he participated in the Watergate break-in to gather intelligence on an alleged VVAW militant working at DNC headquarters.

A 19-year veteran of the CIA, McCord had been spying on antiwar radicals since the late ’60s. He was a conservative Republican who had supported Sen. Barry Goldwater’s (R-Ariz.) strategy to threaten North Vietnam “with the use of an atomic bomb” if it did not stop attacking South Vietnam. And he also blamed Democrats — Presidents Kennedy and Johnson — for getting the U.S. into the Vietnam War in the first place.

In September 1971, a year after retiring from the CIA, McCord was hired as director of security by Nixon’s reelection campaign. His mission: “to prevent a reoccurrence at the 1972 GOP Convention in Miami of the violence and bloodshed by protesters which had occurred at the 1968 DNC Chicago Convention.”

“I became involved in the Watergate break-in when I received FBI reports that a group of VVAW members in Gainesville, Florida, were planning violence against the GOP Convention in Miami,” McCord claimed, also saying he received reports that “VVAW members had discussed the assassination of 3 U.S. Senators, John Tower of Texas, John Stennis of Mississippi, and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.”

The assassination threat was real. At the VVAW’s Kansas City convention in November 1971, southern coordinator Scott Camil proposed a plan to visit congressional offices during the next protest in Washington and shoot “the most hardcore hawks.” As a Marine sergeant in Vietnam, Camil “spent two years killing women and children in their own … homes,” he recalled in a 1992 oral history interview. He justified shooting the hawkish senators who created that policy and “were voting to continue the … war when the public was against it.”

After hearing the proposal in Kansas, John F. Kerry “totally flipped out,” according to Camil, while others accused him “of being an undercover agent trying to discredit the organization.” Camil’s plan was voted down but infiltrators reported his comments to the FBI, and within weeks, J. Edgar Hoover warned Camil’s local FBI office he was an “extremely dangerous and unstable individual whose activities must be neutralized at [the] earliest possible time.”

McCord claims he agreed to take part in the Watergate break-in so he could search and bug DNC headquarters for information on the VVAW volunteer allegedly working there. But his suspicions were misplaced. There was no VVAW mole at the DNC and McCord and four other burglars were arrested there in the early hours of June 17. McCord was immediately identified as head of security for the Nixon campaign and later served four months in prison.

During the Senate Watergate hearings that followed, McCord tried to raise the assassination plot against three U.S. senators to justify his actions, but Sen. Sam Ervin, the Democrat who chaired the hearings, wasn’t interested.

Toward the end of his life, McCord continued to make the case to his family that a terrorist threat by anarchist revolutionaries justified his illegal entry into and bugging of DNC headquarters. His message to his family is clear: his role in the Watergate break-in was a matter of national security — to stop the assassination of three U.S. senators by radical antiwar protesters who threatened the safety of the country.

But McCord’s secret motivation for the break-in was based on false information and doesn’t absolve him of responsibility for his crimes. Those crimes, along with his willingness to expose the White House coverup of Watergate through his letter to Sirica, remain his legacy.

A deeply religious man, McCord refused to be bought off with a pardon and realized his decision to participate in Watergate was a mistake. After Nixon’s resignation, he wrote: “The whole Watergate affair has begun a tremendous ‘cleansing’ of the nation. … Watergate was the turning point in getting the nation back on the course our Founding Fathers envisioned for this great country.”

While both sides of the political aisle united to force Nixon’s resignation, the fiercely partisan response to the Mueller report suggests it will not prove as cathartic as Watergate. But in time, the secret motivations and hidden agendas of those indicted by the special counsel may emerge, giving us a new perspective on their public testimony to date.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/a-watergate-burglars-account-of-his-crimes-and-what-it-tells-us-about-the-mueller-probe-indictments/2019/05/09/4ad36aa0-ae2e-4810-9ac7-c6a060956494_story.html,2019-05-09T06:00:52Z,Washington Post,"1301 K St NW, Washington, DC 20071"

‘Heroic’: Details emerge in Colorado school shooting,"He was a high school senior, set to graduate this week.

But instead of celebrating Kendrick Castillo’s graduation, the family of the 18-year-old will be mourning his death.

Castillo, a senior at STEM School Highlands Ranch in suburban Denver, was killed in a classroom Tuesday in a shooting that police say was carried out by a pair of his classmates: 18-year-old Devon Erickson and a younger classmate who has not been identified because she is a juvenile. Eight other students were injured in the shooting.

The charter school campus has more than 1,800 students in kindergarten through 12th grade, including small children who streamed out of the school weeping and with their arms raised to escape the danger.

Nui Giasolli was in her British literature class when she said a classmate began shooting. She told NBC’s “Today” that Castillo lunged at the man who opened fire and was shot. Several other classmates also worked to take the shooter down, she said.

“The next thing I know, he’s pulling a gun and telling nobody to move,” Giasolli said. “That’s when Kendrick lunged at him, and he shot Kendrick, giving us all enough time to get underneath our desks to get ourselves safe, to run across the room to escape.""

[One student dead, eight others wounded in shooting at suburban Denver school]

The shooting happened not far from Columbine High School, a community still on edge after marking the 20th anniversary of a shooting there that shocked the country.

District Attorney George Brauchler, who grew up in the region, said at a news conference Wednesday morning that if someone had told him that in 20 years the region would endure multiple mass shootings, he would have thought them crazy. “These are aberrant acts,” he said, despite the fact that several attacks have happened within a 20-mile radius.

Now is the time to mourn and to weep, he said, but the people of Colorado are resilient. “My kids are going to go to school today,” he said, acknowledging the conversations anxious parents are having. “I recommend everyone else send their kids, too.”

Details of the shooting began to emerge Wednesday.

Within two minutes, the first deputy arrived and confronted a gunman, Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said. Deputies struggled with the suspects before taking them into custody, he said.

Neither suspect was injured, he said, and no gunfire was exchanged with them. One of the suspects was restrained by the armed private security officer who had been hired to protect the school, Spurlock said.

“I have to believe the quick response of the officers that got inside that school helped save lives,” Spurlock said.

About 600 students were in the section of the school where the attack unfolded. Authorities are still in the early stages of interviewing witnesses and learning what happened, the sheriff said. “We are going to hear about very heroic things that happened at that school.”

Five of the students who were shot have been released from hospitals, Spurlock said, and three remain in intensive care.

The wounded students were 15 years old or older, he said. All nine of the students harmed were shot at the school, Spurlock said.

The Denver region has been on edge as the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre was memorialized, and deadly threats were called in to other Denver-area schools. The Columbine attack, in which two teenagers killed 13 people, marked the beginning of a new era in the United States — a time when the threat of school shootings has taught a generation of children how to flee, hide and even fight back when faced with a gunman.

The week of the anniversary, one of those threats shut down area schools for nearly half a million students when an 18-year-old Florida woman who authorities say was a threat to the community flew to Denver, purchased a weapon and seemingly disappeared. After a two-day manhunt, Sol Pais was found dead of apparent self-inflicted wounds. No one else was injured.

The anniversary came a few days later, and when it was over, the relief was palpable in the community, said John McDonald, head of security for the Jefferson County Public School District.

“But for the school safety community, we can never let our guard down,” he said. “This is a reminder of why.”

It had been only days since another school shooting. At the University of North Carolina at Charlotte last week, a student tackled a gunman who opened fire in a classroom, police said, killing two and wounding four others.

At least eight people were injured and two suspected student shooters were in custody after a shooting was reported at a Colorado STEM school on Tuesday, officials said.

The Douglas County Sheriff's Office said it responded to the STEM School Highlands Ranch just before 2 p.m. when a school administrator called dispatch to report shots fired.

""Two individuals walked in to the STEM school, got deep inside the school and engaged students in two separate locations,"" Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said. He added that one suspect was a juvenile male and the other was an adult male.

Spurlock said that several of the people who were injured are in critical condition.

The shooting occurred in the middle school and officers heard shots as they were entering the school, Undersheriff Holly Nicholson-Kluth said earlier in the day.

“The only thing that we know of right now from one interview is that we have a handgun. Other than that I cannot tell you of other weapons,” said Spurlock.

Multiple agencies, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, responded to the scene to assist.

Students at the public charter school for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics were being evacuated.

STEM School Highlands Ranch has 1,850 students — 550 elementary age students, 700 in middle school and 600 high school students, according to the district.

Rocco DeChalk, who lives blocks from the school, heard a stampede of students running past his house.

“I saw all of them running, so I thought it was a gym class at first,” he told NBC News. “But then I saw there were so many of them.”

After going outside, he saw a teenage boy shot in the back and sitting by a mailbox two doors down. The boy was with a teacher and a friend, who had been applying pressure to a bullet wound.

They called 911 and the dispatcher told them to take cover, so they helped the young victim into DeChalk’s kitchen. The man eventually flagged a passing policeman who then caught the attention of an ambulance, which rushed the youngster away.

All the time, the boy remained conscious.

“He made a comment, `Oh, I’m starting to feel it now,’ “ DeChalk said referring to the pain. “I told him that was probably the adrenaline kicking in and he was going into shock.”

Nyki Giasolli said her daughter, Kamananui, was in the classroom when a shooting happened. Giasolli said she was told by her daughter that people came in shooting.

“She said that two of her classmates took the shooters down, and she was able to escape,” the Giasolli told KUSA. ""She just said there were people shot; that’s all I know.”

Her daughter, who is a senior, and her son, Kupono, a freshman, are both safe.

“She called me, and she was hysterical and she told me that there had been a shooting,” Giasolli said.

Giasolliehe said her daughter said the shooters were students.

“We chose a small school because we thought they’d be safer, because we thought that everybody would know everybody,” she said.

Another parent told KUSA that her son was apparently in a room next to where the shooting occurred and was safe with a teacher. That teacher called her to let her know her son was OK.

She said that the school has been sending automated voice messages and was told there was a lock down.

The campus is just eight miles southeast of Columbine High School in Littleton, site of the April 20, 1999, mass shooting in which two gunmen murdered 12 fellow students and a teacher before killing themselves.

The shooting comes just weeks after a Florida woman, Sol Pais, sparked a security scare that shut down area schools after authorities said she appeared to have an “infatuation” with the Columbine shooting and had purchased a shotgun in the area.

Pais, 18, was found dead on April 17, two days after she flew to the area, of an apparent suicide, authorities said.

Exclusive: Trump fixer Cohen says he helped Falwell handle racy photos,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Months before evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr.’s game-changing presidential endorsement of Donald Trump in 2016, Falwell asked Trump fixer Michael Cohen for a personal favor, Cohen said in a recorded conversation reviewed by Reuters.

FILE PHOTO: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen stands behind Trump as a group of supporters lay hands on Trump in prayer during a campaign stop at the New Spirit Revival Center church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, U.S. September 21, 2016. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo

Falwell, president of Liberty University, one of the world’s largest Christian universities, said someone had come into possession of what Cohen described as racy “personal” photographs — the sort that would typically be kept “between husband and wife,” Cohen said in the taped conversation.

According to a source familiar with Cohen’s thinking, the person who possessed the photos destroyed them after Cohen intervened on the Falwells’ behalf.

The Falwells, through a lawyer, declined to comment for this article.

Cohen, who began a three-year prison sentence this week for federal campaign violations and lying to Congress, recounted his involvement in the matter in a recording made surreptitiously by comedian Tom Arnold on March 25. Portions of the recording — in which Cohen appeared to disavow parts of his guilty plea — were first reported April 24 by The Wall Street Journal.

The Falwells enlisted Cohen’s help in 2015, according to the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking, the year Trump announced his presidential candidacy. At the time, Cohen was Trump’s confidant and personal lawyer, and he worked for the Trump Organization.

The Falwells wanted to keep “a bunch of photographs, personal photographs” from becoming public, Cohen told Arnold. “I actually have one of the photos,” he said, without going into specifics. “It’s terrible.”

Cohen would later prove successful in another matter involving Falwell, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Cohen helped persuade Falwell to issue his endorsement of Trump’s presidential candidacy at a critical moment, they said: just before the Iowa caucuses. Falwell subsequently barnstormed with Trump and vouched for the candidate’s Christian virtues.

Reuters has no evidence that Falwell’s endorsement of Trump was related to Cohen’s involvement in the photo matter. The source familiar with Cohen’s thinking insisted the endorsement and the help with the photographs were separate issues.

Cohen’s connection to the Falwells sheds light on the formidable alliance between Trump and a man who, through his university, is one of the most influential evangelical figures in America. Falwell’s backing helped galvanize evangelicals and persuaded many Christians concerned about Trump’s past behavior to embrace him as a repentant sinner.

Falwell’s support for Trump has not wavered throughout the New York celebrity-politician’s own tribulations, including the Access Hollywood recording of Trump talking about grabbing women’s genitals and payoffs made by Cohen to hide Trump’s extramarital affairs. This past weekend, Falwell tweeted that “Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term” to make up for the two years of the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

BLOCKBUSTER ENDORSEMENT

Falwell’s endorsement of Trump, however, did surprise some students and staff at Liberty University, the school in Lynchburg, Virginia, founded by Falwell’s father, Jerry. It was at Liberty where fellow Republican presidential candidate and major Trump rival Ted Cruz had chosen to launch his campaign the previous year. Cruz’s father was an evangelical preacher, much like Falwell’s father; Trump has been married three times and divorced twice. For years, prior to running for president, Trump boasted of his sexual exploits and supported a host of social positions, such as abortion rights, that run counter to beliefs espoused by Falwell.

Although Falwell declined interview requests for this story, he has said repeatedly that he endorsed Trump because Trump was the strongest candidate, had significant experience running a business, and had the right vision for the country.

The connection between Trump and Falwell goes back years. In 2012, Trump gave the convocation at Liberty University. One link between Trump and the couple appears to have been Cohen, a now-disbarred New York lawyer who formed a close bond with the Falwells.

During the campaign, Cohen worked closely with Liberty University to help promote Trump’s candidacy. It was around that time that Cohen heard from the Falwells about the photographs, said the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking.

The Falwells told Cohen that someone had obtained photographs that were embarrassing to them, and was demanding money, the source said. Reuters was unable to determine who made the demand. The source said Cohen flew to Florida and soon met with an attorney for the person with the photographs. Cohen spoke with the attorney, telling the lawyer that his client was committing a crime, and that law enforcement authorities would be called if the demands didn’t stop, the source said.

The matter was soon resolved, the source said, and the lawyer told Cohen that all of the photographs were destroyed.

Months later, in early 2016, Trump faced what seemed like an enormous challenge. The Iowa caucus was coming up, and Cohen — then deeply loyal to Trump — was concerned about how Trump would fare, the source said. Cohen felt Trump “was being slaughtered in that community,” and “didn’t want to see him embarrassed or, you know, without support,” said the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking. Cohen repeatedly reached out to Jerry Falwell, and pleaded with him to back Trump, the source said.

Soon after, according to this account, Falwell made his historic announcement. “I am proud to offer my endorsement of Donald J. Trump for President of the United States,” Falwell was quoted saying in a statement issued by the Trump campaign. “He is a successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.”",http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/aMkgkfiInQg/exclusive-trump-fixer-cohen-says-he-helped-falwell-handle-racy-photos-idUSKCN1SD2JG,2019-05-07T17:31:16Z,Reuters,"333 Bay St, Toronto, ON M5H 2R2, Canada"
Rehoboth man surprises wife with huge billboard for 10th anniversary,"CLOSE Ethan and Tara Rhodes celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary on April 18. Jessica Bies, The News Journal

It's no secret that Ethan Rhodes is crazy in love with his wife.

But now, it's not just close friends and family who know it. Anyone who has driven on Del. 1 through Lewes in the past few weeks probably has an idea of how the local businessman feels.

""10 years ago, I hooked the catch of a lifetime!"" reads a huge billboard at the intersection of U.S. 9 and Del. 1, next to the furniture store Creative Concepts.

Ethan had it put up on April 18, the couple's 10th wedding anniversary, as a surprise for the love of his life, Tara.

""I've never seen a man who loves his wife as much as he does,"" said Laura Navarre, who does marketing for Ethan's company and is also a professional photographer.

She helped design the billboard and was there for the unveiling.

BSD, one of the largest suppliers of building materials in eastern Sussex County, rents the billboard to promote the family-owned business, she said.

Ethan said they switch the artwork out about once a season.

Two months before his wedding anniversary, ""it just dawned on me,"" he said.

""It just hit me in the middle of the night, and I started texting messages to Laura and the guy who does the billboard.""

He had been trying to think of something ""big"" he could to do to commemorate the couple's anniversary, and the billboard fit the bill.

Ethan and Tara got married in the Bahamas in 2009, he said, two years after going on a blind date at Striper Bites in Lewes.

At the time, he was 35 and half-convinced he'd never get married.

Originally from Sussex County, he had moved back to the area full-time in 1996. Tara, who works for IBM, moved back to Delaware from Miami.

Tara said when she went on that first blind date with Ethan, she wasn't really ready to be in a relationship. She told him she had the flu and couldn't go out again, but he persisted, sending her flowers and chicken noodle soup.

The rest, as they say, is history.

Ethan likes to say that Tara is out of his league, bragging that she is ""drop dead gorgeous"" in addition to being a great mom to their two girls, 4-year-old Ainsley and 8-year-old Kendall.

""I over punted my coverage on that one for sure,"" he said.

But in their wedding photos, Ethan poses as the catch — literally. In one picture, Tara reels him in using a large fishing pole.

The playful photo helped inspire the message on the sign, Ethan said.

The picture on the billboard is more recent. It's of the couple on the pier at the Rehoboth Beach Yacht and Country Club.

Faking an emergency

On the morning of April 18, Ethan dropped his daughter Ainsley off at school then rushed over to Del. 1, where the billboard was being put up. Almost immediately, his phone blew up with text message and calls from friends who had seen it driving through town.

One of Tara's friends sent out a group text, warning everyone not to ruin the surprise.

Ethan and Tara spent the morning getting ready to fly out to Florida and the Bahamas for spring break. Then they picked up the girls from school and headed to the airport.

Ethan was fairly sure Tara hadn't heard about the billboard yet and didn't want her to see it through the front windshield.

So he faked an emergency, claiming to smell smoke and instructing the Cadillac's driver to pull over at the nearby BP gas station because the car was on fire.

""Everyone jumps out of the car, and she's grabbing the kids,"" Ethan said.

His act was so convincing, Tara hardly noticed when Ethan started talking about the billboard.

""Who cares about your billboard right now?"" she remembers thinking as she tried to get the kids out of the car.

She finally realized something was up when her parents and best friend walked out of the convenience store. Ethan had her turn around and look at the billboard, while Navarre took pictures of her reaction.

“We definitely surprised her,"" Ethan said. ""She loved it.""

The billboard wasn't the only surprise, he said. During the unveiling, he and the girls also gave Tara a diamond necklace.

Tara said she had no idea what Ethan was planning.

""He's a grand gesture kind of guy, but I never would have expected something like that,"" she said. ""He definitely got me pretty good.""

What to do next time?

Ethan said a lot of his friends have razzed him for the billboard, asking him how they're supposed to compete when getting anniversary gifts for their own wives.

But Tara and Ethan have only been married for 10 years, he said. He's not yet sure what he'll do for their 20th wedding anniversary, but said it will be even bigger than the billboard.

""Oh, I'll top it, don't you worry,"" he said. ""I have 10 years to figure it out.""

The billboard will likely be changed within the next couple weeks. Ethan and Tara left it up until their daughter's first communion so visiting family could see it, but it will soon revert back to promoting the business.

Tara said Ethan has always been really good at picking out gifts and she has no doubt he'll surprise her again for their next anniversary.

""He's a lot of fun,"" she said Tuesday. ""He's always the life of the party, and he keeps life very interesting.""

Drinking kicked my butt for long time,"Providing a rare glimpse into his legendary life, Joe Namath reveals in a new book how he almost drank himself to death in his post-playing days.

The former New York Jets star says he drank excessively because a voice in his head told him to. To combat the urge, Namath came up with a name for the voice: Slick.

""Every now and then Slick whispers, but having a name for him makes me listen to him differently. And, health-wise, I'd probably be dead by now if I hadn't stopped drinking,"" Namath says in the book, ""All the Way: My Life in Four Quarters.""

Few athletes over the last half-century have garnered as much publicity as Namath, a flamboyant quarterback who became a cultural icon. He never has shied away from the spotlight, but he hasn't shared much in print. The book, released Tuesday, is his first autobiography in 50 years, according to his publicist.

It recounts in vivid detail the Jets' historic win over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III, which Namath famously guaranteed. He weaves in his life story, providing stories about his life away from football -- his playboy image, his concern about post-football brain trauma and his battle with alcohol.

Namath, 75, recalls his infamous sideline interview in 2003 with ESPN's Suzy Kolber, during which he told the sideline reporter he wanted to kiss her. In the book, he calls that moment a turning point in his life.

""I saw it as a blessing in disguise,"" says Namath, who admitted to being drunk during the interview. ""I had embarrassed my friends and family and could not escape that feeling. I haven't had a drink since.

""That shame is where I found my strength to deal with the addiction. With the help of my recovery, I learned that I had used my divorce as an excuse to go back to drinking. That knowledge made me a stronger individual.""

At the behest of his then-wife, Deborah, Namath says he saw a psychologist in Brentwood, California, because of his drinking. But after each session, he says, he'd stop at a liquor store and buy a pint of vodka.

""I thought I could get away with that, but she could smell it,"" he says.

They were divorced in 2000, which exacerbated the problem, Namath says.

""The drinking was what would kick my butt for a long time,"" he says. ""I believe any of us can be brought to our knees whether from physical or emotional pain. Over the years, I learned how fragile we humans can be. Emotionally, I used that as an excuse to start drinking again. ... I would drink all day sometimes.""

Namath was a legendary lady's man in his playing days, frequenting clubs across Manhattan. Although he doesn't kiss and tell in the book, he gives some insight into his nocturnal habits. He says he typically stayed out until 3 a.m. on weekdays during the season, thankful that coach Weeb Ewbank held late practices.

""I was in my early 20s when this fame hit, living in one of the sexiest cities in the world,"" he says. ""So it felt natural to turn toward it and not shy away. I enjoyed the company of ladies and, man, were there a lot of places servicing the singles crowd.""

Namath, inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985, also touches on the concussion issue, saying he suffered ""at least a handful"" during his career.

He says he became concerned about his own health after witnessing the ""heartbreaking"" decline of former Jets teammate Dave Herman, who is battling traumatic brain issues. That, combined with the suicides of former NFL players Dave Duerson and Junior Seau, prompted Namath to undergo hyperbaric oxygen therapy at Jupiter Medical Center in Florida.

""I don't know where I would be today without taking those [hyperbaric] dives because there is absolutely no doubt about the improvement,"" he says.",http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/26691377/namath-drinking-kicked-my-butt-long,2019-05-07T10:35:30Z,ESPN.com,"ESPN Plaza Bristol, CT 06010"

According to Somerset County Prosecutor Michael Robertson, Ryan D. Keogh is lodged in the Somerset County Jail and has been there since Feb. 21 by an Order of Pretrial Detention entered by Judge Kathy C. Qasim.

David and Cindy Keogh were charged Feb. 14 and were released on their own recognizance.

Robertson stated at approximately 7:36 p.m. Jan. 9, the Middlesex Borough Police Department received a 911 call reporting shots fired and a gunshot wound victim at a residence on Farm Lane. Middlesex Borough authorities relayed the call to Bound Brook police who responded and located Coulanges outside the residence suffering from gunshot wounds. Responding officers, along with medical personnel, initiated life-saving measures and subsequently transported Coulanges to an area trauma center where he was pronounced dead.

Robertson stated that detectives from the Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office Major Crimes Unit and Crimes Scene Investigations Unit responded to the scene, along with detectives from the Bound Brook Police Department to conduct the investigation. Investigators interviewed numerous neighbors who reported hearing what they believed to be gunshots during the time frame of approximately 5:30 to 6 p.m.

The investigation determined that Ryan D. Keogh, along with his parents, left the residence on Farm Lane for a period after Coulanges was shot and before Cindy Keogh placed the 911 call at 7:36 p.m. A preliminary finding by the Medical Examiner’s Office listed Coulanges’s cause of death as gunshot wounds and the manner of death as homicide.

"Let the voters decide Trump's fate, not further investigations: your say","0505 CARTOON (Photo: Jeff Koterba, Omaha World Herald, NE)

Voters decide

Speaking as an independent, I have prepared a statement for the Democratic Party – We have reviewed the redacted Mueller report.

First and foremost, we are appalled at the extent to which the Russians interfered with the 2016 election and vow to not let this happen again. Although we take issue with much of the White House’s behavior on this (including ostensibly welcoming and encouraging Russian interference), we are relieved that the president has not been found guilty of conspiring with the Russians. We vehemently disagree with the summary of William Barr concerning obstruction of justice. Mueller has laid out multiple examples of Trump's attempts to obstruct.

Nonetheless, we have determined it is in the best interest of the citizens of our country for Congress not to pursue further investigation of this matter or impeachment. The divisive state of our nation has reached a critical point and further pursuit would push the polarization to the breaking point.

We are therefore focusing on any bipartisan legislation that can yet be accomplished during the current administration, along with building a positive platform for the 2020 election where we plan a resounding victory. We will ultimately let the voters decide about this matter.

What subjects are you talking about at the kitchen table? I think we all have favorite subjects based on age, position in life, kids, grandkids, health, local issues, traffic, etc. When media talks about kitchen table subjects, they focus on what drives readership and viewership. White nationalism? Impeachment? Transgenders in the military? $15 minimum wage? Spoiled wealthy kids paying / bribing into prestigious schools?

We may laugh at Bernie and Joe, we may cringe at AOC and Adam Schiff and we do care about our country. What we do care about is a safe and secure country, we depend on our politicians to do their jobs and we most certainly want the best for our kids.

I support term limits and campaign finance but the corruption is just redefined. When we hold leaders responsible things will change. And that goes for all of our local politicians and civic leaders. it is not about you but about us.

How sad

When the abused women banded together to fight this epidemic of men taking advantage (sexually, etc.) of women, my first reaction was great.

Then, it dawned on me. Yes, it gave women their much-needed ""voice"" but,it also gave a weapon of unfairly accusing an innocent ""hug.""

The most obvious was a political advocate of Bernie Sanders, who came forward on national television to accuse Joe Biden of ""invading her space."" She admitted her Sanders affiliation and also did not accuse Mr. Biden of any sexual advances, but did succeed to dirty the water.

For shame to use Biden as a scapegoat for political lies.

I have lived a long time (87 years) and in my younger years I personally operated a restaurant in New York City; most of my patrons were attorneys and successful business men with politicians as well. I was hugged by the vast majority of my customers.

How sad that a warm loving man such as Joe Biden could even being chastised by a political worker. Shame on you, for not only Biden, but for the women who were abused against their will and now have a voice.

From life imprisonment to 40 years; man continues to challenge sentence,"CLOSE Stay on top of the latest news, sports and entertainment Shreveport Times

A man who appealed his life sentence and was resentenced twice within this past year is seeking to challenge his sentence another time.

Derrick Demetrius Duncan, 39, was found guilty in May 2000 on one count of attempted-armed robbery.

At the time of trial, he additionally faced two counts of attempted second-degree murder but was found not guilty on those offenses.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the benefit of probation, parole or suspension on the conviction as a third-time felony offender.

Since then, he has been resentenced twice.

In September 2018, his life sentence was set aside, and he was sentenced to 70 years at hard labor. Months later, on Feb. 28, he was re-sentenced to 40 years imprisonment at hard labor, according to Caddo Parish Court minutes.

In the most recent court documents filed Thursday, the case file was ordered to be sent to Court of Appeal, Second Circuit.

The document also read that the Louisiana Appellate Project was appointed to handle the appeal.

Illegal life sentence

When Duncan was initially sentenced in 2000, the law required that he be sentenced to life without benefits because he was a third-time felony offender.

Later, the law changed, and his life sentence became illegal because only two of his three prior felonies fell into certain categories that required a life sentence, according to a Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, opinion filed in August 2018.

‘Excessive’

After he was resentenced in September 2018, an attorney with the District Public Defender office requested that Duncan’s 70-year sentence be vacated and for him to be given a different sentence.

The attorney argued in a court document that at the time of the resentencing, they were unaware that their office was representing the client, that they were unaware of the case and were not given prior notice.

Because of this, the attorney was unable to provide a defense when Duncan was resentenced incorrectly on the statements made by the prosecutor which alluded to the attempted murder charges, per court documents.

The attorney also claimed they requested a lesser sentence, despite not being familiar with the case.

“…I, without any prior knowledge of the case, trial, or facts, stated I believed Seventy (70) years was excessive and asked for something closer to the minimum twenty-four (24) years and nine (9) months,” the attorney, Michelle M. AndrePont, wrote.

The 70-year sentence was set aside, and he was resentenced to 40 years.

In March, Duncan’s attorney filed another request to appeal the sentence, again claiming the 40-year sentence is “excessive, resulting in the miscarriage of justice” and a violation of his rights.

The court denied this request, but later ordered the case file to be sent to the Court of Appeals.

Ex-NFL star Deion Sanders apologizes to hometown in overdue return,"CLOSE Deion Sanders, a North Fort Myers High School graduate, shares portions of his life story with the community on Saturday at Fort Myers High School. Kinfay Moroti, The News-Press USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA

Deion Sanders' return to Fort Myers, Florida, on Saturday was an effort at reconciliation with his hometown.

The two-time Super Bowl winner and World Series player was awarded a key to the city during a community forum Saturday night at Fort Myers High School.

The relationship between Sanders, 51, and the city he grew up in has been a rocky one. It included failed business proposals such as a 2005 attempt to build affordable housing where it's needed the most and an arrest for trespassing and fishing on a private lake near Southwest Florida International Airport.

But on Saturday night, all of that appeared to be forgotten as Sanders was welcomed on stage with a standing ovation with audience members cheering loudly for him.

""You are indeed a hometown hero,"" said Fort Myers Mayor Randy Henderson.

The event was attended by about 150 people, and their recognition of Sanders prompted the Pro Football Hall of Fame member, known as ""Prime Time,"" to apologize to his childhood city.

""This is long overdue. This is like a reconciliation for me,"" Sanders said. ""The reason it hurt so bad was because I don't give a damn what they say about me in Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, New York,"" Sanders said. ""I don't care because it was my job. ... When you talk about me, some things I let slide, but you are all family. You only get one shot at calling the place home.""

""Thank you from the bottom of my heart,"" Sanders said. ""God was saying reconciliation. This has been reconciliation and a spirit of peace since I got here.""

""I apologize to you as well. You have no idea what you all did to me this particular weekend. The best is yet to come.""

For his return, Sanders brought with him Dallas-area Pastor Omar Jahwar to hold Prime's Community Correction, a forum meant to understand the problems that Fort Myers faces. On Sunday, Sanders was set to host his Prime Elite Underclassmen Camp for local athletes at Bishop Verot High School.

The Saturday night talk was a fact-finding mission but included few details on how to help the city. Sanders promised to return.

Violence, poverty and lack of opportunity are some of the factors that lead to violence in a community, Jahwar said.

""Social civility is available to young people even when they don't understand it,"" Jahwar said. ""Violence becomes the language of those who are underserved.""

Jahwar mentored Antong Lucky, founder and former leader of the Dallas 415 Bloods gang, and the two are now part of Urban Specialists, a group that looks to use the experience of former gang members as the best way to keep others from that life.

""The key thing for us to do, especially people who are trying to help, is to listen,"" Lucky said. ""You've got to hear what people want without judging them.""

Lucky said violence, drug dealing and gangs become part of the equation because of proximity. It's what they see in their community, Lucky said, and it's a cycle that continues.

However, Sanders didn't get caught up in it. Sanders grew up in Dunbar but at an early age said he would stay away from drugs and alcohol to remain focused on sports and school.

""I am only up here right now because I had a plan,"" Sanders said. ""I did not allow anyone out there to affect my plan.""

Sanders was almost brought to tears when he spoke about his mom, Connie Knight, and the long work hours she put in at Lee Memorial Hospital.

Sanders also thanked her for exposing him to life outside his neighborhood. He said she would take the North Fort Myers High School graduate for drives down McGregor Boulevard and to Naples. The exposure to a different life showed him what was possible.

""I was exposed to so much that I had a choice so I didn’t fall prey,"" he said. ""I had seen another way. That influence changed my life.""

Henderson said Sanders' ""message quite frankly was one of the most powerful messages I have witnessed in my adult life.""

His apology was an ""outward demonstration"" of his character.

""I'm not sure that was necessary, but he felt that was necessary and that's what I respect and I honor that,"" Henderson said.

Lehigh High School football coach James Chaney, who played with Sanders at North Fort Myers and Florida State University, said it was good for his team to hear Sanders talk about his accomplishments.

Chaney said he was grateful for Sanders' return and the past should remain in the past.

But he said it's important to remember there are men in Dunbar and Fort Myers who are working to make change for others.

""I don't ever want to discount what the average man has done for our kids,"" Chaney said. ""You don't have to be a NFL player to give back, and I feel (Sanders) feels that, too.""

Earnest Graham, football coach at Evangelical Christian School and a former NFL player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said Sanders appears to be ""a man of purpose"" and will get things done.

Fort Myers Councilwoman Terolyn Watson is hoping the city and Sanders can move forward and facilitate changes that are needed.

""I think Deion's main message tonight is the choices you make in life can make a difference,"" Watson said. ""He's one of our most successful people. He has a great story. He's a great role model.""

Darrell Rowe, 14, was excited to see Sanders in person. He plays football and basketball and participates in track.

""He's someone I can look up to, someone who made it out,"" the Oak Hammock Middle School student said. ""I can do the same thing and I can make it out.""",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/601635150/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Former-NFL-star-Deion-Sanders-apologizes-to-hometown-in-longawaited-return/,2019-05-05T12:49:46Z,USA TODAY,"7950 Jones Branch Dr, Tysons, VA 22102, USA"
Pit bull recovering after being dragged by truck in Florida,"Pit bull recovering after being dragged by truck in Florida Video

Spring Hill, FLA - HERNANDO COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - A young pit bull is recovering after he was allegedly dragged by a rope that was tied to the back of a pickup truck bumper, witnesses told News Channel 8.

It happened at the intersection of Northcliffe Boulevard and Franconia Avenue in Spring Hill on Friday morning.

Jan Harwood, the owner of Nature Coast Animal Wellness and Surgery Center in Weeki Wachee, said she watched as the dog was dragged by a truck that was going 30 to 40 miles per hour, and hurled onto the road.

Harwood and another man in a van pulled over as the driver of the truck drove away.

She said the pit bull, which she named ""Ollie,"" had severe road rash all over his body. The pads of his feet were worn off.

Harwood said the van owner brought the injured dog to her clinic, which is just up the highway and a veterinarian performed X-rays and ultrasounds. The vet said Ollie had no broken bones or internal injuries, which is amazing, considering the traumatic incident he had just been through.

“He was beating the ground with such velocity and such a high rate of speed, so he was being pulled along and then when the driver of the truck decided to make a turn, luckily when he made that turn, the dog's head slipped out of the collar. It was attached to the rope,” Harwood said.

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office is searching for an older, beat up, blue pickup truck with furniture in the back.

In the meantime, “Ollie"" is being fostered at a vet tech's house and might be available for adoption once he is healed.",http://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/pit-bull-recovering-after-being-dragged-by-truck-in-florida/1980199054,2019-05-05T11:20:27Z,WCMH,"3165 Olentangy River Rd, Columbus, OH 43202, USA"
Passenger: 'I felt like we were probably not going to have good ending',"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A Texas man and his father returning from a work trip to Guantanamo Bay shared a frightening experience when a chartered Miami Air 737 they were on made a hard landing at NAS Jacksonville and skidded into the St. Johns River.

Tyler Hall said he didn’t hear anything from the pilot but everyone could clearly tell something was wrong because the plane wasn’t slowing down on the runway. He braced himself.

""When we were coming in, it felt like we were coming a little fast and then hit the runway. It felt like we skipped, and it was like we never slowed down. We continued going and we were running out of runway,"" Hall said. ""When we got close to the end, I felt like we were probably not going to have a good ending.""

Once the plane landed in the St. Johns River, Hall said water came through the roof of the cabin and he was soaked.

Despite the chaos, he said everyone on the plane put their fears aside to make sure all got off safely.

Hall then noticed paramedics rushing through the aisle to help a man who was injured.

""There was a bunch of people in the aisle. They said, 'Hey there’s a medic coming through.' They obliged, let the medic and it turns out the (wounded) guy was actually my father.""

Once he got off the plane, Hall checked on his father.

""Once we got everybody out, I poked my head back in and just asked and said, 'Hey, there was an older gentleman that was sitting right there in 13F, and I was just checking to see if he was alright,'"" Hall said. ""Someone said, 'Yeah, he’s helping get people off.'""

Hall said his father had a laceration on his forehead but he is home and doing well. Hall made it back home to his pregnant wife and son in Texas one day late, but safe and full of appreciation for his fellow passengers.

He said a plane full of strangers instantly became a team with a mission: to make sure everyone got off safely.

“What could have been a tragedy turned out to be an absolute coming together of a bunch of fine folk,"" Hall said. He feels blessed to have been surrounded by a selfless group of people who helped him get back home to his family.

"2014 archive: Plenty of sharks, but few attacks; There's been no local fatalities in 131 years","Bull shark

Editor's note: This story was originally published in The News-Press Aug 10, 2014

Shark attacks are rare in Southwest Florida: Not one person has died from a documented shark attack in the past 131 years.

Only 15 attacks have been recorded in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties, according to the International Shark Attack File, an arm of the University of Florida that keeps records back to 1882. While there are uncountable numbers of sharks plying local waters, Southwest Florida is not shark-bite central. Far from it.

""Nothing in your area,"" said George Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File. ""We had one in Okaloosa County and that is the only Gulf of Mexico nip this year.""

While the east coast records dozens of attacks each year, with Florida leading the world in attacks in 2013 with 23, the Southwest coast experiences few attacks. The area is home, however, to one of the most threatening shark species on the planet — the strong-jawed bull.

""It doesn't mean there aren't plenty of sharks in Southwest Florida, and although fatalities are few and far between on both coasts, the fatality rate tends to be higher in the Gulf of Mexico,"" Burgess said. ""One of the big attackers in the Gulf of Mexico is the bull shark. It likes lower salinity levels, and there's a big nursery area in Ten Thousand Islands, the Caloosahatchee River and all along Southwest Florida.""

Bull sharks have more testosterone, per pound, than any animal on the planet. The high hormone levels combined with the strongest bite in the shark world, again pound-for-pound, makes for a particularly dangerous shark. And their teeth are similar to jagged saw blades, sharp enough for a human to use to fillet a fish.

""It's not because they do it more often, it's because they go after larger prey and have teeth that are designed for shearing,"" Burgess said. ""Most of the other sharks, such as the blacktip — which is often involved the most on the east coast, don't have serrations like a steak knife. (Bulls) are a very persistent shark. When they attack it's not unusual for them to come back for a second or third chance. They're persistent. They're No. 1 in Florida.""

Statewide, there have been 11 recorded shark-attack fatalities since 1882. Only four attacks have been fatal along the west coast, the latest coming in 2005 in Walton County in the Panhandle. The closest fatality to this region occurred in 2000 in the Tampa Bay area.

Phil Motta is a shark expert at the University of South Florida who studies how shark jaws function. He said a large bull shark is capable of producing 1,330 pounds of force, which is more, per pound, than great white or tiger sharks can generate.

""We do have quite a few sharks, and we've had sharks attack people spearfishing and a lady standing in shallow water in the Venice area,"" Motta said. ""Then we had the gentleman who was killed when he jumped into a school of fish. Then we had a man that was attacked after he and his family had been diving off a sailboat repeatedly. A bull shark singled him out and attacked repeatedly. But he survived.""

The fatality Motta mentioned was the Tampa Bay area death when a man dived from a dock into a school of baitfish — which was being followed by a large bull shark.

As far as the shark that always has everyone worried — the great white — there simply isn't enough food to sustain them near our shores, and experts say the chance of a white shark biting a person in our area of the Gulf is astronomical — like winning the lottery twice.

"Man touches himself on Florida beach because women were 'in thongs,' police say","FLAGLER BEACH, Fla. - A man who was inappropriately touching himself on a beach Thursday afternoon said he did it because women come to the beach ""in thongs,"" according to the Flagler Beach Police Department.

Police said they were called to a beach on North Ocean Shore Boulevard around noon by a woman who said she saw a man, later identified as Kenneth Andrews, 52, inappropriately touching himself while staring at her.

When officers arrived, they said they watched and recorded video for about 30 minutes as Andrews laid on his back with his legs open, touching himself through his swim bottoms, which were pulled up so high that he was nearly exposed, according to the report.

Andrews made statements that he ""knew better"" and was only making sure that he was ""not hanging out"" as officers arrested him then later at the police station, he made comments about women showing up to the beach in thongs, the affidavit said.

The woman who called 911 was able to identify Andrews as the man she saw on the beach, according to authorities.

"Florida man accused of using BB gun, werewolf mask to torture girl","PENSACOLA, Fla. - A Florida man is accused of torturing his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter by burning her, shooting her with a BB gun and wearing a werewolf mask to scare her.

Andrew Ross Celaius, 37, was arrested April 9, but additional charges were announced Wednesday.

Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan described videos investigators found of Celaius torturing the child as ""the thing nightmares are made of.""

Morgan said Celaius placed a dog collar on the girl and shocked her awake at night. Then, he stood over her wearing a werewolf mask, Morgan said.

Investigators said the mother didn't know about the abuse. It was discovered when she brought the girl to a hospital for treatment of ringworm, which turned out to be burns.

Celaius faces multiple counts of child cruelty. A lawyer isn't listed on jail records.

These leather-clad bikers will do whatever it takes to make abused kids feel safe,"Share This Story Tweet Share Share Pin Email

Editor's note: This story originally published in 2012. We're revisiting it this week as part of Karina Bland's newsletter, ""I meant to tell you."" Subscribe to her newsletter here and get more every week.

The 11-year-old girl hears the rumble of their motorcycles, rich and deep, long before she sees them. She chews her bottom lip, nervous.

They are coming for her.

The bikers roar into sight, a pack of them, long-haired and tattooed, with heavy boots and leather vests, and some riding double. They circle the usually quiet Gilbert cul-de-sac, and the noise pulls neighbors from behind slatted wood blinds and glossy front doors.

One biker stops at the mouth of the street, parks in the middle of the road and stands guard next to his motorcycle, arms crossed.

The rest back up to the curb in front of the girl's house, almost in formation, parking side by side. There are 14 motorcycles in all, mostly black and shiny chrome. The bikers rev their engines again before shutting them down.

The sudden silence is deafening. The girl's mother takes her hand.

The leader of this motorcycle club is a 55-year-old man who has a salt-and-pepper Fu Manchu and wears his hair down past his shoulders. He eases off his 2000 Harley Road King and approaches the little girl.

He is formidable, and intimidating, and he knows it. So he bends low in front of the little girl and puts out his hand, tanned and weathered from the sun and wind: ""Hi, I'm Pipes.""

""Nice to meet you,"" she says softly, her small hand disappearing in his.

Pipes — the bikers all go by their road names for security — steps back and another biker comes forward, also bent low and hand out, smiling. She has a long blond ponytail, and her name is Nytro. Next is D'Animal, his arms thick with muscles, a do-rag covering his head.

Rock, who is as solid as one, assures the little girl: ""I'm really a nice guy."" She smiles. And then there's Pumpkin and, whoa, the girl looks way up, squinting against the morning sun. ""Hi, I'm Tree,"" he says, and he's as tall as one.

Sassy. Rembrandt. And then Harmony and Shiraz, and the child does a double take. Yes, there are two of them, twin biker chicks. Surely. Uno. Smiles. Tool. Mo Money. Bigg Dogg. Fat Daddy. Ghost Daddy. Father Time. And Trucker, who's louder than all the others.

The girl chewing on her lip was abused by a relative, according to police reports — someone she should have been able to trust. He's not in the state any longer, but the criminal case is progressing slowly, so he's not in jail, either.

He still terrorizes her at night, even though he's nowhere near. She wakes, heart pounding. The nightmare feels real again. She never feels safe, even with her parents just downstairs.

The unruly-looking mob in her driveway is there to help her feel safe again. They are members of the Arizona chapter of Bikers Against Child Abuse International, and they wear their motto on their black leather vests and T-shirts: ""No child deserves to live in fear.""

This one is very afraid.

A tough image

Even kids know that nobody messes with bikers. Bikers look big, and strong, and mean, both in real life and in how they are portrayed on television and in films. They are easy riders, sons of anarchy, not afraid of anything. And they take care of their own.

A child who has been abused by someone bigger and stronger knows too well what it feels like to be small and vulnerable. BACA shifts that balance by putting even bigger and stronger people — and more of them — on the child's side.

And if those even-bigger and stronger people are scary-looking too, perhaps with flaming-skull tattoos, chains on their belts and scars of questionable origin, so much the better.

""The biker image is what makes this work,"" says Rembrandt, 54, who is tall and wiry strong. ""Golfers against child abuse does not have the same feel. The pink alligator shirt and golf shoes standing in the driveway doesn't do the same thing.""

(No offense to golfers. Some bikers golf, too.)

“The biker image is what makes this work. Golfers against child abuse does not have the same feel. The pink alligator shirt and golf shoes standing in the driveway doesn't do the same thing.” Rembrandt of Bikers Against Child Abuse's Arizona chapter

What Rembrandt knows is that a biker's power and intimidating image can even the playing field for a little kid who has been hurt. If the man who hurt this little girl calls or drives by, or even if she is just scared, another nightmare, the bikers will ride over and stand guard all night.

If she is afraid to go to school, they will take her and watch until she's safely inside.

And if she has to testify against her abuser in court, they will go, too, walking with her to the witness stand and taking over the first row of seats. Pipes will tell her, ""Look at us, not him."" And when she's done, they will circle her again and walk her out.

""When we tell a child they don't have to be afraid, they believe us,"" Pipes says. ""When we tell them we will be there for them, they believe us.""

Earlier in the day, when the bikers met in the parking lot of a nearby CVS pharmacy, Pipes reminded them to be mindful of their emotions. That means no hugging unless the child initiates it.

""Nytro,"" Pipes says, raising his eyebrows in her direction. Nytro hides her face behind her hands, and everyone laughs. She's quick to hug.

And then Pipes says, more sternly this time: There will be no crying.

""I don't want to see any tears coming out of your eyes, and the child doesn't either,"" he says, making sure everyone is looking at him when he says it.

""Remember why we're here: to empower the child. If you can't handle it, keep your shades on.""

Part of the family

The little girl in the driveway needs to be able to believe. Her parents, the police and her therapist all tell her that she is safe. But it's hard when someone you once trusted ended up hurting you.

After all the bikers introduce themselves, Pipes holds up a small vest covered in patches, just like the bikers' but made of denim instead of leather. On one patch is the girl's new road name: Rhythm, for a girl who dances and plays music.

""Rhythm,"" she repeats, and smiles.

""This means now you're part of our big, ugly family,"" Pipes says as he helps her into the vest, first one arm and then the other.

""Speak for yourself — we're not all ugly!"" a voice calls out, and the bikers laugh.

Pipes bends low again and tells Rhythm, ""If you're afraid, you call us. Whenever you need us, we will be here.""

Rhythm nods, tears in her wide blue eyes.

He gives her a T-shirt just like the one the bikers wear. He unfolds a do-rag for her but then hesitates: ""I don't know if you want to wear it.""

""It's cool,"" Rhythm says, and turns around so Nytro can tie it on her head.

""Is that too tight?"" Nytro asks. Rhythm shakes her head no and turns back around, grinning.

The girl turns suddenly, bolting from the group. She is gone, through the open garage door and into the house. Five minutes pass. And then a different Rhythm emerges, one who shed her lavender girly T-shirt, shorts and flip-flops in favor of her black BACA T-shirt, blue jeans and new biker vest.

The bikers cheer and clap.

""It doesn't mean you go out and get a tattoo,"" Trucker teases. Rhythm assures him that she's afraid of needles, and he gives her a few temporary tattoos with BACA's logo on them.

There is one more rite to Rhythm's welcome into the BACA family: She gets to go on a ride with the group, and she gets to choose her bike. Whoever owns the motorcycle she picks has the honor of taking her.

Rhythm walks along the row of bikes, looking them over, one by one. She decides on a black 2005 Yamaha Road Star Midnight Edition.

Tree lets out a whoop. She picked his.

Tree is a 43-year-old father of four, a truck driver training to be a certified motorcycle mechanic. He's so big that Rhythm can't get her arms around him, so she reaches up and grabs hold of the arm holes of his vest instead.

Few of the bikers wear helmets, as they are not mandated by law in Arizona, but they make the kids do so. Rhythm's is fastened in place and then she and Tree are surrounded by another half-dozen bikes. The group roars out of the cul-de-sac together.

Rhythm shouts up at Tree: ""This is so cool!""

Fifteen minutes later, they are back, and Rhythm slides off the bike, taking Rembrandt's offered hand.

""It was fun!"" she announces as Smiles pulls off her helmet, and then to Tree she says, ""Sorry, I probably was squeezing you really hard.""

""Thanks for going on a ride with me,"" Tree tells her. ""That was really fun.""

""Can I ask you a question?"" Rhythm asks him. Sure, Tree says.

""How tall are you?""

He's 6 feet 10.

""Wow,"" she says. ""You'd be a great basketball player.""

Tree, a member of Bikers Against Child Abuse, is excited that a new child that the group is serving has chosen his motorcycle to ride during the group's initiation process.

In just the short time the bikers have been here, not even an hour yet, there has been a change in Rhythm.

She slowly moved into the half-moon of bikers, and they closed in around her. She's answering questions about school, the chickens out back and what kind of music she likes.

And she's laughing.

To her parents, it is like music. Her mother wipes her eyes with her fingertips; her dad takes pictures.

""Look how bright her face is,"" says Rhythm's therapist, who is there on the driveway, too. ""It hasn't been that bright in a long time.""

Two of the bikers will be Rhythm's ""primaries,"" her main contacts in the group. Sassy, 34, a mother of six and a former paralegal, and Tool, 46, a co-owner of a payment-processing company, will be hers. They will be available to her 24 hours a day by cellphone.

""Now you realize you're stuck with all of us,"" Pipes says, and Rhythm nods, smiling.

Pipes tests to see whether Rhythm understood what he meant earlier when he told her that these people are her family now. He puts his hand on Uno's shoulder and asks her, ""Who's this?""

""Uno, my big brother,"" she answers.

""Who's this?""

""Tool, my big brother.""

Pipes points: ""Who's that?""

""Harmony, my big sister.""

""Who are all of these people?"" Pipes asks, holding his arms wide.

""My family,"" Rhythm says firmly.

And then she hugs Pipes, burying her face in his vest: ""Thank you for coming to see me.""

Sassy turns away so no one sees her tears.

And one after another, the bikers put their sunglasses back on.

Why they do it

The bikers are all volunteers, giving five, 10, 20 or more hours a week. There's no reimbursement for gas or the time they take off work. They have to go through background checks and prove themselves to the group. But each has a reason for doing so.

Nytro is a 54-year-old mother of three, all grown now, and grandma to six. She and Rembrandt have been happily married for almost 30 years, and they run a residential and commercial painting business.

Her life was not always as sunny.

“I get to stand up for a child and say, 'No one is going to hurt you anymore'.” Nytro of Bikers Against Child Abuse's Arizona chapter

The mistreatment started at about 7, after her father left. She learned to hide in the closet to cry, because if her mom saw tears, she would hit her again. She spent years in a cycle that sent her from her mother to her grandparents and back, to social workers and foster homes and back again.

""There wasn't anybody there for me,"" Nytro says. ""I know how it felt to tell people, 'I don't want to go back. Please don't make me go back,' and no one would listen to me.""

Finally, she ran away. She lived outside for a while, bathing in a lake and doing odd jobs for money to buy food. Pregnant at 17, living in a home for unwed mothers, she was asked to give up her baby for adoption.

""Hell no,"" was her answer. ""God gave him to me."" She promised her tiny son that she would be the best mother. At 38 now, he tells her that she made good on her promise.

Now Nytro does for children what no one did for her. If she tells a child she will be there, she's there.

""I get to stand up for a child and say, 'No one is going to hurt you anymore,'"" Nytro says.

""If that means we die, dang it, we stand ready to be that obstacle.""

What therapists can't do

There's a knock at the front door, and 6-year-old Fast Track hides around the corner in the dining room.

""Who are you hiding from?"" a voice floats in through the doorway, and Fast Track giggles, giving away his location.

Nytro throws her long blond ponytail over her shoulder and crouches down in the entry, arms open. Fast Track hugs her around her neck, where a black industrial filigree tattoo disappears down her shirt.

Nytro and the boy in her arms met in August for the first time with an initiation like Rhythm's. Nytro and Rock, 47, a sculptor who works in stone — thus his road name — are his primaries.

""You're our little brother, huh?"" Nytro asks Fast Track. He nods vigorously: ""I'm in the family!""

""I get to stand up for a child and say, 'No one is going to hurt you anymore,'"" Nytro says of being part of Bikers Against Child Abuse.

Fast Track's father died when he was a baby. He told his uncle and grandparents that he was abused by his mom's boyfriend. The little boy lives with his grandparents, who now are his legal guardians.

""He was scared, and he was scared for us because he was told that if he ever told anyone what happened, they would get hurt, too,"" his grandmother said.

""We'd do anything to keep him safe, but he doesn't know that,"" his grandfather adds. He nods toward the bikers. ""They make him feel safe, and they make him feel like we are safe.""

Fast Track's grandfather says he learned more from Pipes and Sassy about such things as how to navigate the child-welfare system and how to file for a restraining order and guardianship than he had from the boy's state child-welfare caseworker.

""Until we got involved with BACA, we just 100% felt lost and alone,"" he says. ""It's just such a relief that there's someone else on his side.""

Fast Track is not paying attention to what his grandparents are saying. He wants to hear Nytro whistle. She puts two fingers in her mouth and blows, sharp and loud.

""That's really good,"" Fast Track tells her. He tries it, but no noise comes out. Nytro repositions his fingers and reassures him that she couldn't do it right until she was in eighth grade.

""I just kept practicing and practicing until I got really good,"" she says, and then asks, ""So how's school going?""

Fast Track takes his fingers out of his mouth. ""I took the day off,"" he says. His grandmother says he is scared to go out on the playground at recess in case his abuser shows up there.

Nytro will have none of that: ""If he needs us, we will go to school and be there at recess, so he can play. We will do whatever it takes.""

DeAnna Wahlheim is a licensed family therapist in Phoenix. Fast Track is the second child she has referred to BACA after hearing founder John Paul Lilly speak at a conference here a few years ago.

“When kids are coming from a situation where they are terrorized, they need to have people say, 'We have your back, we're going to keep you safe.'” DeAnna Wahlheim, a licensed family therapist in Phoenix

""There are things I can't do as a therapist,"" Wahlheim says. She can call Child Protective Services or the police, but there isn't always enough evidence to put away an abuser. And although she can help young victims recover mentally, she can't protect them physically.

""Just by connecting them with BACA, I know they have a support system in place that will be there forever,"" she says.

""When kids are coming from a situation where they are terrorized, they need to have people say, 'We have your back, we're going to keep you safe,'"" Wahlheim says.

She allowed Fast Track's primary bikers and Pipes to be in her office in February while she had Fast Track participate in a therapeutic role-playing activity. The boy took a rubber sword to an inflatable punching bag, a stand-in for his abuser.

""You're never going to hurt me no more,"" Fast Track yelled.

""You're never going to call me stupid again,"" the boy said between strikes, his chest heaving. ""You don't scare me anymore.""

Pipes, a father of two, grandfather of three, admits that he teared up on his motorcycle on the way home from Wahlheim's office: ""Fast Track is finding his own strength now.""

Somebody has his back

Fast Track's other primary, Rock, roars around the corner toward the little boy's home.

""What's going on, little brother?"" Rock says, easing off his bike and bending low so he can hug the boy.

Despite Rock's size — he's 6 feet 2, bearded and bulky — kids aren't afraid of him. In fact, his size is why Rock makes Fast Track feel so safe, his grandmother says.

""I think just that presence will help him understand that he has someone who has his back,"" Rock says of Fast Track, a child who Bikers Against Child Abuse has pledged to help.

(Photo: Pat Shannahan/The Republic)

Rock has two daughters, ages 12 and 18. He says he joined BACA three years ago because he wanted the camaraderie of riding in a group but with a positive purpose.

Rock calls Fast Track every week and has a special ringtone on his cellphone that alerts him when the boy calls him.

""I want him to know that we're around. We're always going to be around if he needs us. I think just that presence will help him understand that he has someone who has his back,"" Rock says.

Fast Track stands on the top of Rock's foot, holding on around his leg. He wants to show Rock pictures from his last go-kart race.

Rock went to watch Fast Track's first race in January. When Fast Track spotted the biker, he ran to hug him.

But a chain-link fence separated the track from the parking lot. Rock crouched down and intertwined his thick fingers with Fast Track's small ones through the metal links.

They pressed their foreheads together, Rock's do-rag against Fast Track's new helmet, and then Rock shooed the boy back to his go-kart.

As Fast Track pulled away from the starting line, he took one hand off the steering wheel to give Rock a thumbs-up.

""It was pretty cool,"" the big biker of few words says, with a grin. ""It was pretty cool.""

Group's beginnings

Bikers Against Child Abuse is an international non-profit with an annual budget of $200,000 and more than 160 chapters in 36 states and five countries.

But it started with just one frightened 8-year-old boy in a therapist's office in Utah.

John Paul Lilly is a licensed clinical social worker and play therapist and a professor at Brigham Young University. In 1995, he was working with that 8-year-old boy, who was so afraid that he wouldn't leave his house, even though it was July and the other neighborhood kids were outside playing.

The boy would do well in therapy, but then his abusers would show up at his house at night, or leave a note on his bike, warning him that they were watching. The boy stayed terrified, and Lilly stayed frustrated.

Lilly knew how the boy felt. He also had been abused when he was young. When he was 8, living in a tough Los Angeles neighborhood, he was befriended by some bikers who gave him a road name: Chief.

""They became my family,"" Lilly says. ""I just never felt more secure than when I was with them.""

So it was instinctual, years later, for Lilly the therapist to turn to bikers he knew in the area for help with his small, scared patient.

""Bikers have a soft spot for kids,"" says Lilly, 54, who has been riding since he was a teenager. ""I couldn't quote you a figure, but I know that a lot of bikers had been abused as kids.

""When they see a chance to step in and release some of their own demons, they have no problem standing up for a child. It was just such a natural fit.""

Twenty-seven motorcycles carrying about 40 bikers lined up for that first ride. By that afternoon, the boy was outside riding his bike, wearing a vest with a Harley-Davidson patch on it.

Members of the Bikers Against Child Abuse speak about their mission to church groups, social-service agencies, rotary clubs. And BACA bikers go to events like festivals and art walks, handing out brochures and answering questions.

In Utah over the past 16 years, bikers have helped about 1,200 children. BACA's work has been cited in numerous academic and scholarly journals, including Play Therapy. Lilly does speaking gigs at child-welfare conferences across the country and is speaking at the International Play Therapy Conference in Cleveland this October. He even got an invitation to the White House in 2005 from first lady Laura Bush as part of the ""Helping America's Youth"" initiative. (The first lady allowed him to wear his biker vest, T-shirt, Levi's and boots instead of a suit and tie.)

Here in Arizona, Pipes started the Maricopa County chapter of BACA in 2006 and received an official charter in 2007. The Pima County chapter got its start in 2010. Together, about 30 members juggle about 25 active cases, with about 100 children on their rolls.

The bikers must be tough, not only to protect the kids but to be able to stomach knowing what their young charges may have been through. An 8-year-old beaten by Mom; a 6-year-old molested by his mother's boyfriend. A girl, 10, raped. They are trained by a licensed mental-health professional affiliated with the chapter. Each biker must be fingerprinted and undergo a thorough criminal-background check, the same one required for state child-welfare workers and law-enforcement officers, before they can join the group.

They are bikers, not Boy Scouts, so if the background check turns up an arrest or a stint behind bars, they can still be in the group. The crime just can't involve children, domestic violence or something comparable. They visit children only with permission and only in pairs, so no one is ever alone with a child.

Lilly says BACA has been watched closely for a long time, both by law enforcement, who want to make sure they stay on the right side of the law, and by motorcycle clubs, who want to make sure they don't become extensions of the police in biker circles.

Indeed, BACA members walk in two worlds. They all have jobs — in this group are an architect, a social worker, a college student, a law-enforcement officer, a paralegal, mechanics, business owners, parents and grandparents. They go only by their road names in their BACA lives; if you were to ask one what another's actual name is, he or she likely wouldn't have any idea. Road names are part of biker culture, but they serve a different purpose here: By never using a biker's or child's given name, it is less likely that an abuser could attack a biker in retribution or follow a biker to find a victim who has moved. (The Republic and azcentral.com have chosen to abide by the BACA rule.)

""We don't hide our intentions. We're straight up out there. We're very clear that if you come against this child, and you get hurt in that process, that's your problem,"" Lilly says.

Because BACA's members go by their road names and operate across the world, it is impossible to know whether there have been any physical confrontations between them and abusers, or any mishaps on motorcycles, though Lilly says there haven't been.

""We don't hunt anybody down. We're just who we are. We don't become somebody else.""

But anyone who wants to get to one of their kids has to get through them first.

Called into action

Rembrandt's phone rang at 3:15p.m. on a Saturday. He was on his way home from his grandson's karate tournament, about 5miles from his Mesa home.

It was Sassy. A BACA kid was in trouble.

Her road name is Music, and she's 10. She belonged to a BACA chapter in another state but is now living in Arizona with her grandmother. That makes her Sassy's and Rembrandt's kid now.

Her abuser is in jail, but his family members had tracked the girl down in Arizona and were banging on the grandmother's front door, demanding that she turn the girl over to them, shouting up at the second-floor window where the child was huddled in her bedroom. Her grandmother called BACA and then dialed 911.

The bikers know the drill well. Rembrandt called those who live closest to him — Rock, Uno and Fat Daddy. He stopped to change out of his grandpa clothes — shorts, T-shirt and sandals — and put on his biker garb — jeans, boots, leather vest, holster and handgun.

The bikers carry weapons on stakeouts only when there is a threat against a child and they feel that as citizens they also could be threatened. Otherwise, Rembrandt says, they do not wear weapons around children. He says most of the bikers are licensed to carry concealed weapons.

Rembrandt stuffed water bottles into his saddle bags and jumped on his 2000 purple-and-orange Indian Chief.

By 3:40 p.m., the four men were on their way to Music, the rumble of their bikes announcing their arrival. Music's grandmother rushed outside when she heard them, hugging Rembrandt and giving him a piece of notebook paper with a description of the people and their license-plate number.

Sheriff's deputies had been there, she said, and had escorted the people out of the neighborhood. But it is a public street, and law-enforcement officers just don't have the manpower to stay for long. She feared that once the deputies left, the people would be back.

She was right. But when they did return later that evening, they saw something different: four big bikers, all wearing shades even in the dimming light, their motorcycles backed into the mouth of the driveway.

Rock had something resembling a cannon strapped to his leg; Rembrandt wore his gun on his hip.

To someone trying to mess with a little girl, a group of large, strong bikers sends a certain message, Rembrandt says. ""It just has a different feel than a cop,"" he says. More unpredictable, maybe.

""Cops are actually handcuffed by specific rules and laws that we are not. A cop has to work within a framework,"" Rembrandt says. ""You can flip off a cop. You don't want to flip off Rock."" Just knowing that a biker doesn't have to follow rules or honor boundaries can intimidate a person trying to make trouble.

That night, Music's grandmother pitched a small tent in her granddaughter's bedroom, right under the window, so the little girl could look out the window whenever she wanted to see the bikers at the end of the driveway.

Bikers guarded the house in shifts for the next 2½ days. Some rode two hours from Tucson, kept watch for eight hours and then rode home again.

They talked in low voices, and once Music was asleep, the red embers of their cigarettes glowed in the dark.

Rembrandt got involved with BACA four years ago, dragged into it, really, by his wife, Nytro.

""She's the kid lover. I'm not a real kumbaya kind of guy. It's just not in my personality,"" Rembrandt says.

But Nytro wanted to get involved, and Rembrandt was her ride. If he was going to be around, he had to undergo a background check anyway — ""I still had no intention of joining"" — but then he went on a ride to bring a child into the group.

He watched a scared little girl transform before his eyes. She came out from behind her mother, raised her eyes to look at the bikers and, eventually, gave a smile.

""That's it. I was done,"" he says. ""You can't experience that and not get involved."" Yeah, yeah, he knows. It's a little kumbaya. He's now vice president of the local chapter and is the primary for two children in addition to Music.

The next day, the family members who were after Music came back again, but in a different car. They looked but didn't stop.

""Overall, it was fairly uneventful,"" Rembrandt says. ""The people were all full of muster when it was a grandmother and a child. They changed their minds when they saw us there.""

""I would have loved to have been able to introduce ourselves,"" he adds in mock disappointment.

The bikers aren't looking for trouble. They are there so the kids don't feel so alone, or so powerless. Pipes recalls going to court with an 8-year-old boy, and how tiny he looked on the witness stand, his feet dangling a foot off the floor.

""It's scary enough for an adult to go to court,"" he says. ""We're not going to let one of our little wounded kids go alone.""

In court that day, the judge asked the boy, ""Are you afraid?"" No, the boy said.

Pipes says the judge seemed surprised, and asked, ""Why not?""

The boy glanced at Pipes and the other bikers sitting in the front row, two more standing on each side of the courtroom door, and told the judge, ""Because my friends are scarier than he is.""

Funding their mission

Although the biker image is good for intimidating the kind of people who hurt kids, it can be off-putting for potential donors.

The group is a 501(c)(3) non-profit and relies on donations and grants — including one for $5,000 from The Arizona Republic and 12 News' Season for Sharing campaign — for its annual budget, which ranges from about $5,000 to $12,000 a year, depending on the kids' needs.

Since each biker pays for his or her own gas, maintenance and food or drink, and since there is no rented office space or cubicles or receptionist, one might think that money would go a long way. The expenses they do have, however, add up quickly: $2.75 to $5.50 for T-shirts they give the kids, $20 each for BACA blankets, $4 for a do-rag printed with BACA's logo. To cover a child's denim vest with patches that cost $6.50 to $12 each can easily total $50.

And there are bigger expenses, too. The bikers also pay for different things that help kids heal, such as therapy, karate lessons, horse-riding camp and punching bags.

Each member of Bikers Against Child Abuse pays for his or her own gas, maintenance and food or drink, but expenses for the organization, such as the children's T-shirts, do-rags, blankets and jacket patches add up.

Sometimes they end up spending their own money, like the time five of them each kicked in $100 to take a teenage girl who had been sexually abused to get some new clothes and to have her hair and nails done.

So Pipes speaks to anyone who will listen — church groups, social-service agencies, rotary clubs. And BACA bikers go to events like festivals and art walks, handing out brochures and answering questions.

At a recent Saturday morning meeting of the men's club at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church in Mesa, a dozen bikers sat in the metal folding chairs scattered among the tables set with paper place mats.

At the microphone, Pipes begins, ""I know you were all hoping for a good-looking speaker, but I'm afraid you got me,"" and gets a laugh.

He explains what BACA does and how children are referred to them by child-welfare agencies, therapists and police. He explains, ""Our mission is very narrowly focused; we empower children not to be afraid of the world in which they live.

""... We don't apologize for being bikers. We are bikers first,"" Pipes says, though they are not affiliated with any motorcycle clubs. ""We ride a lot of the same streets they ride, but we have a different path.""

The kids become part of their biker family, and Pipes explains: ""When you're a part of our family, we don't run, and we don't hide.""

It's tough talk. But then Pipes' words shift to talk about the kids, and even a tough, aging biker can't hide how he feels.

""To see the life that was beaten out of them return is amazing. To see that transformation, to give them a chance at a normal childhood again ..."" he pauses, swallows hard, and then says, ""It's why we do this.""

There is silence, and then applause.

""This is wonderful, just wonderful,"" says Rita Belle, pulling her checkbook out of her purse. Ed Tynan has his checkbook out, too: ""I never in a million years would have guessed you guys existed.""

Another man grasps Pipes' arm with one hand and hands him a $20 bill with the other and says simply, ""God bless you.""

That's the kind of reaction the bikers garner, for the most part.

Michelle Morley, a judge in the 5th Judicial Circuit in Sumter County, Florida, has been involved in four cases with BACA in four years.

""You see kids who are so withdrawn and depressed and no sense of self-esteem, and then BACA gets involved, and they come back to life,"" Morley says.

""You have to think that every time they hear motorcycles, they think of their friends in BACA, even if it isn't them. They must think, 'I have these guys and gals looking out for me.'""

She tells of a case in a neighboring county where prosecutors were worried that the 8-year-old victim would be too afraid to testify against her abuser.

But on the stand, the girl, nicknamed ""Cheetah"" by the bikers, sat on the lap of a BACA member, a woman whose road name is Lamb Chop, pointed at that man charged with molesting her, and said, ""That's him.""

In one case, the defense attorney did protest that the child victim likely would not have testified without the bikers there, Morley says, and that probably was true. Often children are too young or too afraid to testify and without other witnesses, cases can be dismissed.

By the way, Morley adds, the defendant was convicted in that case.

Last month, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery met with Pipes and Sassy and was impressed with their work. He says he plans to look for opportunities to use the group to help young victims.

One of his attorneys, Michelle Arino, successfully prosecuted a child-abuse case in 2009, in which the bikers escorted the 5-year-old victim, Sporty, and his 9-year-old brother, Skater Boy, to court twice.

""(Sporty) was a different kid when the bikers were around,"" Arino says. ""He was much more happy, he was much more confident.""

Sporty testified holding a stuffed bear wearing a tiny BACA shirt, a handful of bikers sitting where he could see them.

""They were there so he could have his voice heard,"" Arino says, ""and he did.""

Earning the patch

Every year on the third Saturday of May, bikers in BACA chapters everywhere hold 100-mile awareness rides. In Arizona, each member had to raise at least $100 in pledges or wear a dress on the ride.

Which explains why this year, Dom wore a sundress with spaghetti straps for the ride from Mesa to Payson, his black chest hair curling over the low-cut neckline, the bright yellow fabric bringing out the flames in his tattoo.

(His friends told him their checks were in the mail.)

At the campground, Pipes gathered the bikers in a circle under the pine trees. There are two levels of BACA members — support members and patched members. Being a support member comes first, and you work your way to becoming a patched member by attending monthly meetings, going on child rides, attending court hearings and participating in other BACA events for at least a year. The chapter's board of directors must unanimously agree that a support member is worthy of moving up.

And when a biker makes the grade — which takes an average of 18 months in Arizona — he or she earns the ultimate patch, the one with a BACA logo large enough to cover the back of their vest from shoulder blade to shoulder blade.

Today, three members are receiving patches. Pipes starts with D'Animal.

""This brother has proven himself. We call him. He's there. He's ridden in some real crappy stuff — cold, rain, hail — to get to a child,"" he says.

Tree, the biker who Rhythm thought would make a good basketball player, had been a patched member in Utah. He moved here in March and already has proven himself a valuable member, turning up for every ride and stakeout.

""You deserve it, brother,"" Rembrandt calls out.

Then Pipes calls for Tool, who clearly is surprised — and touched. He presses his thumb and forefinger to his eyes.

""This man has given us a lot,"" Pipes says, clapping him on the shoulder.

""I'm proud to have you guys as brothers,"" Pipes says, shaking each of their hands. ""Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.""

Nytro calls out, ""I have a needle and thread for each of you!""

Actually, someone has brought a sewing machine, and with an extension cord stretched to an outlet in the restroom, D'Animal spends the next three hours attaching the new patches.

Staying through the dark hours

The first time the bikers went to meet Rhythm, Sassy unfurled a thick black blanket with the group's logo on it, a clenched fist with the initials ""B.A.C.A."" tattooed on the fingers, and a skull and crossbones.

Rhythm thought it was cool. But before they gave it to her, Pipes explained, they had to fill it with love. He rolled the blanket into a ball and squeezed it, and then passed it to Nytro, who hugged it tight, her eyes closed.

As the blanket passed from biker to biker, and Rhythm watched it go, Pipes told her: ""When you think this blanket is out of love, you call us, and we will come and fill it back up.""

Two weeks later, a call from the girl's therapist brings them back, not because the blanket is empty, but because Rhythm still is having nightmares.

Sassy and the girl text every day, back and forth. Rhythm carries a coin with the BACA logo on it with her always, turning it in her palm, running her fingers along its edges. But when she sleeps, her mind is vulnerable to the memories of what happened. She is torn out of her slumber, terrified and calling out for her parents.

The bikers are all volunteers, giving five, 10, 20 or more hours a week. There's no reimbursement for gas or the time they take off work. They have to go through background checks and prove themselves to the group. But each has a reason for doing so.

(Photo: Pat Shannahan/The Republic)

""We can tell her she is safe and fine,"" her mother says, but then her voice trails off. Because Rhythm knows that's not always true.

So Rembrandt and Tool pull up to the little girl's house at 8 p.m., park their motorcycles in the driveway and knock on the door. Sometimes a stakeout is to calm fear and build trust.

""I told her that we were going to stay there for the night, so she would know that there was no way anyone was going to get past us to hurt her,"" Rembrandt says.

Rhythm came outside a few times to make sure the men were all right, or maybe to check that they were still there. Before she went to bed, she brought out an ice-cream sandwich for Rembrandt, a popsicle for Tool and a big bowl of popcorn for them to share.

The men talked low in the dark until 2a.m., when the sound of more motorcycles rattled the quiet street. Mo Money and Bigg Dogg pulled up, ready to take the next shift.

When Rhythm woke up, she looked out the window and called to her mother, ""Mom, they're still here!""

""The whole backbone of what BACA does is showing up,"" Rembrandt says. ""We show up when we say we are going to show up, and we do what we say we are going to do.

""We said we were going to stay, and we stayed.""

Just before 8 a.m., the sun up and already hot, the front door opens and Rhythm carries two glasses of orange juice out to Mo Money and Bigg Dogg, where they sit on the front porch in the shade.

Smiling, she tells them she slept, the entire night, with not one nightmare, nestled under the blanket the bikers filled with love.

A few days later, the nightmares will return.

The bikers will as well.

About Bikers Against Child Abuse

Mission statement:

BACA exists with the intent to create a safer environment for abused children. We exist as a body of bikers to empower children to not feel afraid of the world in which they live. We stand ready to lend support to our wounded friends by involving them with an established, united organization.

We work in conjunction with local and state officials who are already in place to protect children. We desire to send a clear message to all involved with the abused child that this child is part of our organization and that we are prepared to lend our physical and emotional support to them by affiliation and our physical presence.

We stand at the ready to shield these children from further abuse. We do not condone the use of violence or physical force in any manner, however, if circumstances arise such that we are the only obstacle preventing a child from further abuse, we stand ready to be that obstacle.

About this story

Reporter Karina Bland spent several months with members of Bikers Against Child Abuse (BACA) as they rode their motorcycles to work with the children under their care and to raise awareness of their non-profit organization.

Because the children involved are victims of abuse, The Republic is not identifying them or their families.

BACA policy is that its members use only road names in their work with children, making it less likely that an abuser could trace one of them back to a child. (Recognizable photographs do not have the same potential to be traced, and therefore are not considered a concern.) If a biker were to be identified in the media by his or her legal name, he or she would no longer be allowed to serve as a child's ""primary"" contact with the group.

While The Republic knows the full names and identities of the bikers, it is honoring the organization's policy.",http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/601840108/0/phoenix/local~These-leatherclad-bikers-will-do-whatever-it-takes-to-make-abused-kids-feel-safe/,2019-05-10T17:24:49Z,azcentral,"200 E Van Buren St, Phoenix, AZ 85004, USA"
Valentine has enjoyed doing what he was supposed to do,"ALMA — Jerry Valentine graduated from Alma High School in 1975 — a standout athlete, well-mannered, respectful teenager with high aspirations.

Jerry Valentine was good at baseball, too. But he had enough smarts to know the St. Louis Cardinals wouldn’t be calling him one day.

But a superintendent might.

“I told Mr. (Charles) Dyer when I interviewed for the baseball job, ‘I’m not going to coach very long.’ I knew I wanted to be an administrator,” Valentine said. “Two years later, the assistant principal’s job opened up.”

Three years earlier, a spry Valentine pounced into the coach’s office shared by John Grant, his former basketball coach, with a piece of paper proclaiming him to be a recent college graduate.

Valentine was ready to go to work.

But Grant had some stern advice for the 22-year-old.

“I told him, ‘I’ve graduated from college; Do you know of any coaching jobs?’ He told me, ‘If I knew of any, I wouldn’t tell you.’ That caught me off-guard,” Valentine said

Grant continued to preach.

“He said, ‘Listen to what I’m telling you. I know you’re broke, because you’ve been in college … you don’t have any responsibilities, so get your butt back into school and finish your master’s degree!’ … In the fall of ’81, I was ready to look for a job, and who knew a job was going to open up at Alma High School?”

In May 1981, Valentine sat down with Dyer, the school’s superintendent, having completed his master’s in educational administration from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.

“I was ready to go to work,” Valentine said.

This month, Valentine will shake hands with the senior class for the final time. Ironically, his last day to patrol the hallways at Alma High School will fall on Friday, May 24 — almost 38 years to the day (May 14, 1981) when the Alma School Board voted to hire the former Airedale as a seventh-grade football coach, head baseball coach and head football coach Frank Vines’ defensive backs coach.

The Alma High School principal announced earlier this spring he was retiring after 33 years as the school’s principal — with an assist from John Grant, of course.

“I remember Jerry was our seventh-grade football coach,” Grant said. “He was coaching one night, and had a pretty good lead late in the game, and he hollered for his defensive backs to loosen up. What he meant was, ‘Don’t let anybody behind you.’”

“I look up and they’re doing jumping jacks.”



New opportunity

Right on cue, when an assistant principal’s positioned opened up, Valentine went to Dyer. In August 1983, Valentine put away his coaches’ whistle for a coat and tie.

Valentine replaced current superintendent David Woolly as the school’s second in command to Leonard Daniel that fall.

“When you talk about Jerry, you talk about integrity, high moral character, honesty and great work ethic,” said Dr. Mike McSpadden, assistant superintendent and an Alma employee since 1979. “He has possessed those qualities since I met him in 1981.”

“He (Woolly) was moved to central office to become assistant superintendent,” Valentine said. “I was the assistant principle under Leonard Daniel.”

Daniel was diagnosed with terminal cancer early in 1986. That fall, though he dutifully had been coming to work, he became too ill to get out of bed.

“Mr. Daniel passed away on Labor Day 1986,” McSpadden said. “Jerry became the principal and I became the assistant principal.”

Daniel was just 48.

“Mr. Dyer called me and asked me to come out and meet with him,” Valentine said. “He told me he was going to recommend to the school board that I be the principal. Mr. Daniel was very well respected; I learned a lot from being around him for three years … He and I had a lot of the same values.”



Early drama

It couldn’t have been easy. But Valentine, in some cases 25 to 30 years younger than some of Alma’s faculty, made it work.

A month later, though, things went from busy to insanely crazy. Alma High School student Henry “Mack” Dozier II, who had hemophilia, was diagnosed with the AIDS antibody he contracted through a blood transfusion.

Dozier, 17 at the time, was the first public school student in Arkansas to be identified as having the antibody for AIDS in his blood.

But Dyer was adamant Dozier remain in school.

Then, before anyone knew what was happening, NBC, ABC and CNN had flooded the parking lot with hulking satellite trucks, hoping to get a glimpse of Dozier, talk to students, and get comments from Valentine and other administrators.

“Actually, what happened was nothing,” Valentine said. “A large number of students went outside and yelled at the TV reporters, shouting, ‘He’s our friend! Leave him alone!’ … It was really neat to see the community come together.”



‘Make it work’

As a somber Alma tried to move past Daniel’s sudden passing that September of ’86, Valentine already had the support of an older faculty — established teachers like Shirley Donnohue, Ted Burkhart, Sherry Carter, Jack Watson, Doug Ritchie and Jerry Vincent.

“I remember those people coming by and talking to me,” Valentine said. “Basically, they said, ‘We’ve got your back.’ They said ‘We’re going to do this, and we’re going to make it work.’”

Valentine was 27 when Dyer ushered him into his office. A few days later, on his 28th birthday, Jerry Valentine was announced as the school’s new principal.

He remained there through 2019.

“Ironically, when I announced my retirement, Dr. McSpadden went into where they keep the records and found the minutes from the Sept. 18, 1986, school board meeting,” Valentine said. “He made a photocopy and gave it to me. That was pretty cool.”



‘Kids are kids’

“It doesn’t matter where you go, kids really just want to be loved and they want to be respected,” Valentine said. “They have a lot of challenges, though. I’ve been able to watch over the years; those challenges and obstacles in their lives seem to be getting bigger.”

The key, says Valentine, is how the students are approached.

“We as educators have to work harder,” he said. “When you see a challenge, you can’t just sit back and think, ‘Well, it’s going to take care of itself.’ I think that’s one of the things I’ve been blessed with … being able to work with teachers.”

Valentine said he has been fortunate to hire “quality people” who really care about the kids both on and off campus.

“So many kids come to school with a lot of baggage,” Valentine continued. “So many of our teachers in this school district, they just embrace the fact if I’m going to be successful, then I’ve got to do everything I can to make every kid successful, and that all boils down to opportunity.”



Men at work

It’s 10:22 on a spring morning as Valentine strolls through the promenade connecting the front entrance near Crabtree Gym to the multimillion dollar Charles B. Dyer Arena. The state-of-the-art facility is home to Alma’s basketball and volleyball teams.

Across the way, Airedale Stadium is now covered with a plush artificial turf. It’s hard to imagine Alma without turf, or enclosed classrooms. But in the late 1980s, Alma High School was still without simple modern conveniences such as air conditioning and carpeted rooms. The parking log adjacent to Crabtree Gym, the heartbeat of the school, was a gravel parking lot. There were potholes. It was muddy when it rained.

In 1989, there were no covered floors; everything was concrete. There were no drop ceilings.

“Mr. Dyer asked the patrons of Alma to vote for a millage increase,” Valentine said. “I think 72 percent of the voters voted for it. It was a very big district-wide building program.”

The school became a maze of construction workers.

“With all four schools, they covered the floors with carpet,” Valentine said. “They added drop ceilings, insulated the rooms and added air conditioning. That was such a culture change. It really put a big emphasis on how important it was to provide quality facilities.”

Valentine said it made a huge difference with the school environment. McSpadden says a true test of leadership is what an organization looked like when they took over as leader, and what it looks like when they leave.

“If you look at what Alma High School looked like in 1986, compared to what it looks like today, it’s night and day,” McSpadden said. “The climate for our school, Jerry has set the tone for the last 30-plus years.”



Competition

This past week, as the chilly spring gave way to humid temps, pop-up thunderstorms helping to soften the green grass, Valentine attended the National DECA competition in Florida.

Alma was well represented.

“When I took over as principal, I asked Mr. Dyer about taking our kids to a new level, to see them not only compete on the state level, but also on the national level,” he said.

Dyer told Valentine that if he got students to the next level, they’d figure out the rest.

“There are opportunities out there in the form of scholarships,” Valentine said. “That’s why we have so many students do well in History Day competition and in regional and state science fairs.”

True to form, and never a man to pass up a day at the office, Valentine returned with Alma’s DECA students from the national convention from Orlando at 1:45 a.m. Thursday.

By 7 a.m., sporting a clean white dress shirt and tie, Valentine was back to work, ready to tackle the day.



Good advice

The son of the late Ross Valentine, an Arkansas state trooper, and Hilda, a longtime Alma schoolteacher, Jerry Valentine is really no different from his brothers, Roy and Carl.

“This is my 38th year with Alma schools,” Valentine pointed out. “I have an older brother that works at the 188th in Fort Smith. He’s been with them probably 41 or 42 years. I have a younger brother (Carl) who is with FedEx, and this is year 32 for him. All three of us, we found something we enjoyed and we stuck with it — I think that’s a testament to my parents.”

Ross Valentine taught his boys to look people in the eye and the value of a hard-earned dollar.

“My dad told me, ‘You need to be a teacher or a police officer, because they’re going to be teachers, and there’s always going to be people to arrest,’” Valentine said. “I believe people are called to preach, and people are called to teach. There have been so many things happen in my career where doors were opened.

“There’s no doubt, this is what I was supposed to do.”",https://www.pressargus.com/news/20190508/valentine-has-enjoyed-doing-what-he-was-supposed-to-do?rssfeed=true,2019-05-09T18:33:45Z,Press Argus,"100 N 11th St, Van Buren, AR 72956, USA"
Opinion: Mike Fiers' no-hitter makes no sense at all - 'Baseball is definitely a weird game',"OAKLAND — It was nearly midnight and Oakland Athletics pitcher Mike Fiers sat behind the dais, trying to somehow explain what happened Tuesday night. He found himself struggling with his emotions.

This made no sense.

No darn sense at all.

The game was 15 minutes from not even being played because of a malfunctioning light bank in left field.

Fiers wasn’t even originally supposed to pitch, but the A's shuffled the rotation on their off-day.

Fiers entered with a 6.81 ERA, but here he was trying to explain how he just threw a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds in Oakland’s 2-0 victory at the Oakland Coliseum, the first of the major-league season, and the 300th in major-league history.

“A lot of things just happened,"" Fiers said. “It’s just weird. You can’t really write these things up. Baseball is definitely a weird game.

“I don’t know, I’m a little kooky playing it.""

Athletics catcher Josh Phegley said he knew it was going to be a bizarre day the moment he walked into the clubhouse.

“I saw Mario and Luigi when I walked in,"" he said. “I saw the light tower not working. Mike throws a no-hitter. And I got covered with steak seasoning.""

Yep, a weird day starting with Athletics slugger Khris Davis buying all of his teammates Nintendo Switches in celebration of his recent two-year, $33.75 million contract. He brought in a couple of guys dressed as Mario and Luigi to hand them out before the A’s got ready for the game, only to wonder if there would be one.

The left-field bank of lights were mostly out. Each team's manager and general manager met at home plate with the umpire crew, with Major League Baseball officials on stand-by, debating whether the game should be played.

“We wanted to make sure the other team would be ok with it,"" Athletics manager Bob Melvin said. “Major League Baseball didn’t want to start after 9 p.m.""

The game started 1 hour, 38 minutes late at 8:45 p.m., and 2 hours and 25 minutes later, Fiers was being mobbed on the field after striking out Eugenio Suarez on a 75-mph curveball. He became the 35th pitcher in baseball history, and only the fifth active pitcher, to throw multiple no-hitters, with his first in 2015 pitching for the Houston Astros against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

He’s also only the eighth in history to throw a no-hitter with multiple teams, joining Hall of Famers Nolan Ryan, Cy Young, Randy Johnson and Jim Bunning. Hideo Nomo, Adonis Terry and Ted Breitenstein have also done it.

""It’s pretty cool,"" said Fiers, who has a career 57-58 record and 4.11 ERA, pitching for his fourth team in five years. “I saw a little bit of the list. I’m just grateful to be here and get the opportunity to play.

“I remember when I was drafted, I wasn’t too high on the charts. I was a guy throwing 88 to 90 (mph), down in South Florida. I’m one in a million down there.

“You almost get emotional, man. I could be working 9-to-5. I could be doing so many other things. And just playing this game I love.

“I’m just blessed.’’

Fiers had third-highest ERA among American League pitchers entering the game, with an 0-2 record and 9.41 ERA and .358 batting average against in his last five starts.

But on this cool evening, he looked like Greg Maddux. He was carving up the Reds, mixing in his 88-90-mph fastball with pinpoint control, to go along with his changeup, slider and curveball. He struck out six batters and walked two in his 131-pitch gem.

Really, it was his pitch count that looked like it may be his biggest obstacle. He had 109 pitches after the seventh inning, and Melvin told Fiers that if he permitted anyone reached base, he was coming out of the game.

“I broke every rule in the book,"" Melvin said. “It was no fun for me once he got past 120 pitches, I promise you that, but he deserved it.’’

The biggest break for Fiers, Melvin said, was when second baseman Jurickson Profar hit a two-out homer in the bottom of the seventh Melvin had the bullpen warming up the entire time in the final two innings.

“I knew I had to be aggressive,’’ Fiers said, “keep them off-balance. You’ve got to be aggressive there.""

Perhaps the most nerve-wracking moment came with one out in the ninth when Joey Votto worked the count to 3 balls and 1 strike. Fiers came back with a changeup, and Votto grounded to first base.

“That’s the first time I realized he had a no-hitter,"" Athletics center fielder Ramon Laureano said. “Really, I didn’t know.""

Well, if not for Laureano’s brilliant catch in the sixth inning that robbed Votto of a home run, Fiers would have been only a footnote.

Votto hit a towering fly ball to center field in the sixth inning when Laureano raced back to the fence, leaped, and snared the ball just as it appeared it might clear the fence.

“I don’t give credit to myself,"" said Laureano, who spoke at length before the game with Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson on playing defense. “He was the story.""

There was also Profar’s play with one out in the sixth inning on Kyle Farmer’s shallow fly ball in right field, only for Profar to make a diving catch.

“Those usually fall in,"" Farmer said, “but I think the stars aligned tonight. Once we saw those two plays happening, we said this might be his night.""

Fiers also benefited from a close scoring call in the fourth inning when Jesse Winker hit a ball up that middle that bounced off A's third baseman Matt Chapman’s glove. No announcement was made for nearly 20 seconds before it was ruled an error.

“It was way more nerve-wracking then when I was doing it,"" said Sean Manea, who had thrown the A's last no-hitter in 2018 and doused Fiers with Gatorade. “I was shaking on the bench. I don’t know, it was crazy seeing him do it.’’

And for the paltry crowd (announced at 11,794) that stayed after the lengthy delay, with perhaps less than half remaining, they were treated to history.

It was only the 13th no-hitter since the Athletics moved to Oakland.

“Amazing, that’s all I can really say,’’ said Fiers. “A bunch of stuff just happened.""

On a night when he wondered if the game would even be played.

“I was worried there,’’ Fiers said. “I’m just glad we got those lights working.""",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/601731440/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Opinion-Mike-Fiersapos-nohitter-makes-no-sense-at-all-aposBaseball-is-definitely-a-weird-gameapos/,2019-05-08T07:01:15Z,USA TODAY,"7950 Jones Branch Dr, Tysons, VA 22102, USA"
"DNA, family tree help solve 52-year-old Seattle murder case","0 DNA, family tree help solve 52-year-old Seattle murder case

SEATTLE - Seattle police said Tuesday they have solved a murder from nearly 52 years ago with the help of DNA and a family tree — a method that has revolutionized cold-case investigations across the U.S. in the past year.

Susan Galvin was a 20-year-old records clerk for the department in July 1967 when she was found raped and strangled in a parking garage elevator at Seattle Center. Dozens of people were questioned, and one potential suspect — a professional clown who had been seen with her a few days earlier, and who quit his job just a few days later — was never charged for lack of evidence. The clown, located in Utah in 2016, was finally cleared by a DNA test.

Last summer, Seattle police provided the killer's DNA to Parabon NanoLabs in Reston, Virginia. CeCe Moore, a Parabon genealogist who is known for her work on the public television series ""Finding Your Roots,"" used a public genealogy database to create a family tree for the killer and ultimately identified a potential suspect as Frank Wypych, a married Seattle man and former soldier who died of complications from diabetes in 1987.

Seattle police exhumed his remains from a cemetery earlier this year to collect DNA and confirmed it matched that collected from Galvin's clothing. They're now looking into whether he may have killed anyone else while stationed in New York, Alaska and Germany while in the Army.

""It's the oldest case where genetic genealogy has helped to identify the suspect,"" Moore said Tuesday. ""It's amazing the DNA was still viable. The original investigators who collected the crime scene evidence did such a great job, long before they could even have imagined what could be done with DNA.""

The use of the public genealogy databases, which contain DNA information from customers of companies like 23andMe and Ancestry.com, as a powerful police tool has taken off in the past year, since investigators in California revealed that they used the method to identify and arrest Golden State Killer suspect Joseph DeAngelo. DeAngelo, a former police officer, is accused of having murdered at least a dozen people and raped 50 in the 1970s and '80s.

At least 40 cases have been solved since then, including now five in Washington state. Among them were the killing of a young Canadian couple in 1987 and the rape and murder of a 26-year-old woman in 1994.

Galvin had left her childhood home in Spokane a year before she was killed, according to a written statement from one of her brothers, Lorimer ""Larry"" Galvin, who now lives in Florida. He thanked Detective Rolf Norton, who began reinvestigating the case in 2016.

""52 years later we learn the who, but still have no clear understanding as to the why,"" Galvin wrote. ""There will always be that lingering question.""

Wypych was 26 and the father of a young child at the time of the killing, police said. He and his wife divorced in 1971, and he was convicted of larceny that year — his only criminal conviction. He served nine months in jail and was arrested for a weapons offense in Seattle in 1975. The department said it no longer had records of the offense, but relatives told investigators he had been impersonating a police officer and making traffic stops in uniform, armed with a gun.

He was living in Federal Way, a south Seattle suburb, when he died.

Michael Cohen Stopped Jerry Falwell Racy Photos From Going Public,"WASHINGTON, May 7 (Reuters) - Months before evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr.’s game-changing presidential endorsement of Donald Trump in 2016, Falwell asked Trump fixer Michael Cohen for a personal favor, Cohen said in a recorded conversation reviewed by Reuters.

Falwell, president of Liberty University, one of the world’s largest Christian universities, said someone had come into possession of what Cohen described as racy “personal” photographs ― the sort that would typically be kept “between husband and wife,” Cohen said in the taped conversation.

According to a source familiar with Cohen’s thinking, the person who possessed the photos destroyed them after Cohen intervened on the Falwells’ behalf.

The Falwells, through a lawyer, declined to comment for this article.

Cohen, who began a three-year prison sentence this week for federal campaign violations and lying to Congress, recounted his involvement in the matter in a recording made surreptitiously by comedian Tom Arnold on March 25. Portions of the recording ― in which Cohen appeared to disavow parts of his guilty plea ― were first reported April 24 by The Wall Street Journal.

The Falwells enlisted Cohen’s help in 2015, according to the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking, the year Trump announced his presidential candidacy. At the time, Cohen was Trump’s confidant and personal lawyer, and he worked for the Trump Organization.

The Falwells wanted to keep “a bunch of photographs, personal photographs” from becoming public, Cohen told Arnold. “I actually have one of the photos,” he said, without going into specifics. “It’s terrible.”

Cohen would later prove successful in another matter involving Falwell, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Cohen helped persuade Falwell to issue his endorsement of Trump’s presidential candidacy at a critical moment, they said: just before the Iowa caucuses. Falwell subsequently barnstormed with Trump and vouched for the candidate’s Christian virtues.

Reuters has no evidence that Falwell’s endorsement of Trump was related to Cohen’s involvement in the photo matter. The source familiar with Cohen’s thinking insisted the endorsement and the help with the photographs were separate issues.

Cohen’s connection to the Falwells sheds light on the formidable alliance between Trump and a man who, through his university, is one of the most influential evangelical figures in America. Falwell’s backing helped galvanize evangelicals and persuaded many Christians concerned about Trump’s past behavior to embrace him as a repentant sinner.

Falwell’s support for Trump has not wavered throughout the New York celebrity-politician’s own tribulations, including the Access Hollywood recording of Trump talking about grabbing women’s genitals and payoffs made by Cohen to hide Trump’s extramarital affairs. This past weekend, Falwell tweeted that “Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term” to make up for the two years of the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

BLOCKBUSTER ENDORSEMENT

Falwell’s endorsement of Trump, however, did surprise some students and staff at Liberty University, the school in Lynchburg, Virginia, founded by Falwell’s father, Jerry. It was at Liberty where fellow Republican presidential candidate and major Trump rival Ted Cruz had chosen to launch his campaign the previous year. Cruz’s father was an evangelical preacher, much like Falwell’s father; Trump has been married three times and divorced twice. For years, prior to running for president, Trump boasted of his sexual exploits and supported a host of social positions, such as abortion rights, that run counter to beliefs espoused by Falwell.

Although Falwell declined interview requests for this story, he has said repeatedly that he endorsed Trump because Trump was the strongest candidate, had significant experience running a business, and had the right vision for the country.

The connection between Trump and Falwell goes back years. In 2012, Trump gave the convocation at Liberty University. One link between Trump and the couple appears to have been Cohen, a now-disbarred New York lawyer who formed a close bond with the Falwells.

During the campaign, Cohen worked closely with Liberty University to help promote Trump’s candidacy. It was around that time that Cohen heard from the Falwells about the photographs, said the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking.

The Falwells told Cohen that someone had obtained photographs that were embarrassing to them, and was demanding money, the source said. Reuters was unable to determine who made the demand. The source said Cohen flew to Florida and soon met with an attorney for the person with the photographs. Cohen spoke with the attorney, telling the lawyer that his client was committing a crime, and that law enforcement authorities would be called if the demands didn’t stop, the source said.

The matter was soon resolved, the source said, and the lawyer told Cohen that all of the photographs were destroyed.

Months later, in early 2016, Trump faced what seemed like an enormous challenge. The Iowa caucus was coming up, and Cohen ― then deeply loyal to Trump ― was concerned about how Trump would fare, the source said. Cohen felt Trump “was being slaughtered in that community,” and “didn’t want to see him embarrassed or, you know, without support,” said the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking. Cohen repeatedly reached out to Jerry Falwell, and pleaded with him to back Trump, the source said.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/michael-cohen-stopped-jerry-falwell-racy-photos-from-going-public_n_5cd1f885e4b07ce6ef773acb,2019-05-07T17:42:00Z,HuffPost,"770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, USA"
"Elmer Tremont, Fort Myers and Cypress Lake High coaching icon, dies at 89","Fort Myers High School girls basketball coach Elmer Tremont watches intently from the sidelines as his team battles it out during a close game with Cypress Lake at Fort Myers in 2002. (Photo: news-press.com file photo)

Elmer Tremont, an area coaching icon, a man who coached and won more games of any kind than anyone in Lee County high school athletics history, reclined in a chair to watch an NBA playoff game Thursday night at his daughter’s home in Lithia. He fell asleep and never woke up.

Tremont, a record-setting punter at the University of Miami and a high school boys and girls basketball and football coach for more than 50 years in Fort Myers, died at the age of 89, sometime in the early hours of Friday morning. He would have turned 90 on Nov. 28.

“There were so many layers to his career,” said Sam Sirianni Jr., whose father’s iconic, 33-year varsity football coaching career overlapped with Tremont’s in basketball.

Tremont won 732 games in football, volleyball and boys and girls basketball over 54 years, all in Lee County. Many of those victories came at Cypress Lake in basketball, as he led the Panthers boys teams often to the state playoffs and even to the state’s final four in 1982.

In 1986, Dave LaRosa first met Tremont after arriving to Cypress Lake from West Virginia as a young teacher and future principal.

“One of the things you could always tell, without even knowing Coach Tremont, you knew from seeing him interacting with other people,” LaRosa said. “When he appeared somewhere, he turned people to him. You could always tell when somebody has a great amount of influence. He always had the ability to do that. Being young and new to the area and not knowing anything about him, I saw that right away. I knew that this guy was something. It didn’t take me long to understand the significance of him.”

Tremont began his coaching career in the 1950s at Fort Myers High after serving for two years as a medic for the U.S. Army in the Korean War.

Born Nov. 28, 1929, Tremont grew up in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. He and his wife Betty Jo, 88, had three children: Linda, Joanne and Teresa.

Linda died from cancer, and Teresa died in a drowning accident, in which her father found her in their home pool two years ago.

“He never really recovered from that,” Joanne Tremont said. The past four months especially have been rough on Elmer Tremont and his wife.

Family and friends are focusing on the joy and the discipline he gave to more than two generations of Lee County student-athletes.

“He was a great coach, and he was also a very good friend,” said Tim Lewis, 75, who played football and basketball for Tremont during the 1950s at Fort Myers High. “He was kind of like a father. I was very close to him. I’m going to miss him very much. He did more for Lee County than anybody, boys and girls, because he coached both.

“He had a lot to do with my life. He was a mean son of a gun. He kicked me off the basketball team in 1959. The whole season, my sophomore year. He did what was right, and I did what was wrong. I don’t remember nothing, but I can remember that.”

Tremont lorded over his 1970s teams as an authoritarian figure, albeit a beloved one.

""Ah, rule No. 1 is that Coach is always right,"" Cypress Lake basketball player Calvin Harrison told The News-Press in 1977, as Tremont glared at him to give the right answer. ""Rule No. 2 is to refer to No. 1 when in doubt what to do.""

The desire for warm weather led Tremont to Lee County by way of the University of Miami. He still holds the Gator Bowl record for punting, averaging 44.5 yards on nine punts, set in 1952 during a 14-0 victory against Clemson.

“He finished high school, and then he got recruited by many schools,” Joanne Tremont said. “A punter and a defensive back. But he chose Miami. He was from the north, and he wanted the warmth and the beaches and everything he never had before. He never traveled much.”

Joanne said she was the “boy of the family,” as she often tagged along with her dad to basketball practices.

“He was like a superhero to me,” she said. “I was proud of him. He was very, very serious about doing the best that he could for the youth of Lee County. When he was at Cypress Lake, he said he never worked a day in his life. He truly loved working with the kids and coaching. He had this drive. Believe me, I know. I don’t play games anymore with people. I’m too competitive. It was in our blood. If you don’t think you can win, then don’t play. That’s just his mentality.”

In the late 1980s, ‘90s and 2000s, Elmer Tremont often “retired” from coaching, only to unretire and resurface at other schools: Estero, where he helped establish the school’s athletic programs in 1987, Fort Myers during the 1990s and as an assistant girls coach at Bishop Verot and Fort Myers during the 2000s.

“Every time he retired, I’d get a new job, and I’d bring him back,” said James Browder, former Lee County superintendent and principal at Estero, Cypress Lake and Fort Myers high schools. “He’s the best basketball coach anywhere. He put every program that I’d put him into that was in disarray and get that program going again. He did it at Cypress. He did it at Fort Myers. He’ll do it in heaven now.”

Tremont leaves a legacy beyond coaching. Twenty-two years ago, he and his friend Monk Hillmyer established the Hillmyer-Tremont Foundation. It held its annual banquet Monday night and awarded three more scholarships, bringing the 22-year total to $1.8 million in scholarship money for local student-athletes.

“Monk Hillmyer was a big business leader, and coach Tremont was the coach,” said Sam Crimaldi, who helps run the foundation. Hillmyer died in 2008. “They were best friends. They went to the Final Four together. They focused not only on their jobs but the greater good of the community.”

Funeral services for Elmer Tremont are slated for 11 a.m. Tuesday, May 21, at Church of the Resurrection of our Lord, at 8121 Cypress Lake Drive, in Fort Myers.

“We had a lot of fun,” said pastor Ed McNamara, who will do the service and has known Elmer Tremont since 1972. “It was just a fun relationship with him. He was just an all-around guy, loved by everyone who ever met him.”

Cypress Lake High School named its gymnasium after Tremont in 1996 and rededicated it to him in 2006 when it was rebuilt following its 2004 destruction by Hurricane Charley.

The Lee County School Athletic Conference Hall of Fame inducted Tremont in 2013.

The Florida Athletic Coaches Association inducted Tremont into its Hall of Fame in 1984. The Florida High School Athletic Association so far has denied Tremont a spot in its hall of fame, an omission LaRosa hopes to someday change.

Sirianni and LaRosa each said Tremont’s career victory mark and long tenure never would be matched.

“Think about that,” Sirianni said. “Fifty years in one community. In today’s structure, the way high school sports and club sports and all the social media, it’s very hard to believe that somebody could coach for that long. You’re talking about just a handful of people who can leave that kind of legacy. He gave back with his foundation. Elmer Tremont, he’s got to go down as one of the legends.”

Measles Outbreak Continues To Spread Across U.S. With 764 Cases Reported,"The number of measles cases in the U.S. this year continues to climb, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting 764 cases in 23 states as of late last week.

The latest numbers, announced on Monday, show 60 more cases since a week earlier.

“This is the greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since 1994 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000,” the CDC said in a release.

CDC There have been 764 measles cases reported in 23 states so far this year, the CDC said Monday.

Pennsylvania is the latest state to join the list. It was reported last week that a Pittsburgh-area man, recently diagnosed with the disease, entered two grocery stores while contagious, local health officials said.

The 23 states that have reported measles cases to the CDC are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Washington.

The CDC has attributed the unusually high number of cases to travelers who contract the disease overseas and then bring it to U.S. communities that have under-vaccinated populations. The states of Washington and New York have seen significantly large outbreaks, with those in New York some of the largest and longest-lasting since 2000.

“When measles is imported into a community with a highly vaccinated population, outbreaks either don’t happen or are usually small,” the CDC has said. “However, once measles is in an under-vaccinated community, it becomes difficult to control the spread of the disease.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/measles-cases-climbing_n_5cd041ace4b0548b735d701f,2019-05-06T13:59:08Z,HuffPost,"770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, USA"

At Least 4 Pets Die Aboard Plane That Crashed Into Florida River: Report,"Four pets are believed to be dead after a plane slid off the runway in Florida and crashed into the river Friday night.

All 143 people on the flight from Cuba to Jacksonville survived, but the animals on board weren't so lucky. At least four pets were being held in the luggage compartment below and are believed to have died, the U.S. Navy told the Daily News.

The luggage compartment was submerged in the crash.

""We're waiting for the plane to be moved before we can retrieve the pets and the luggage on board,"" the Navy spokesperson told the Daily News.

""I think it is a miracle"" no people were killed, the station's commanding officer, Capt. Michael Connor, said at a news conference.

The plane was still in the river Saturday as crews worked to remove it.

"Plenty of sharks, but few attacks; There's been no local fatalities in 131 years","Bull shark

Editor's note: This story was originally published in The News-Press Aug 10, 2014

Shark attacks are rare in Southwest Florida: Not one person has died from a documented shark attack in the past 131 years.

Only 15 attacks have been recorded in Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties, according to the International Shark Attack File, an arm of the University of Florida that keeps records back to 1882. While there are uncountable numbers of sharks plying local waters, Southwest Florida is not shark-bite central. Far from it.

""Nothing in your area,"" said George Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File. ""We had one in Okaloosa County and that is the only Gulf of Mexico nip this year.""

While the east coast records dozens of attacks each year, with Florida leading the world in attacks in 2013 with 23, the Southwest coast experiences few attacks. The area is home, however, to one of the most threatening shark species on the planet — the strong-jawed bull.

""It doesn't mean there aren't plenty of sharks in Southwest Florida, and although fatalities are few and far between on both coasts, the fatality rate tends to be higher in the Gulf of Mexico,"" Burgess said. ""One of the big attackers in the Gulf of Mexico is the bull shark. It likes lower salinity levels, and there's a big nursery area in Ten Thousand Islands, the Caloosahatchee River and all along Southwest Florida.""

Bull sharks have more testosterone, per pound, than any animal on the planet. The high hormone levels combined with the strongest bite in the shark world, again pound-for-pound, makes for a particularly dangerous shark. And their teeth are similar to jagged saw blades, sharp enough for a human to use to fillet a fish.

""It's not because they do it more often, it's because they go after larger prey and have teeth that are designed for shearing,"" Burgess said. ""Most of the other sharks, such as the blacktip — which is often involved the most on the east coast, don't have serrations like a steak knife. (Bulls) are a very persistent shark. When they attack it's not unusual for them to come back for a second or third chance. They're persistent. They're No. 1 in Florida.""

Statewide, there have been 11 recorded shark-attack fatalities since 1882. Only four attacks have been fatal along the west coast, the latest coming in 2005 in Walton County in the Panhandle. The closest fatality to this region occurred in 2000 in the Tampa Bay area.

Phil Motta is a shark expert at the University of South Florida who studies how shark jaws function. He said a large bull shark is capable of producing 1,330 pounds of force, which is more, per pound, than great white or tiger sharks can generate.

""We do have quite a few sharks, and we've had sharks attack people spearfishing and a lady standing in shallow water in the Venice area,"" Motta said. ""Then we had the gentleman who was killed when he jumped into a school of fish. Then we had a man that was attacked after he and his family had been diving off a sailboat repeatedly. A bull shark singled him out and attacked repeatedly. But he survived.""

The fatality Motta mentioned was the Tampa Bay area death when a man dived from a dock into a school of baitfish — which was being followed by a large bull shark.

As far as the shark that always has everyone worried — the great white — there simply isn't enough food to sustain them near our shores, and experts say the chance of a white shark biting a person in our area of the Gulf is astronomical — like winning the lottery twice.

Man accused of killing Winter Park caretaker could be closer to trial date,"ORLANDO, Fla. - A man accused of kidnapping and killing a Winter Park caretaker was in court on Friday to discuss when his trial could start.

Scott Nelson was arrested in 2017 in connection with the death of Jennifer Fulford, who was found dead in west Orange County days after she was reported missing.

Now, nearly two years after her death, Nelson may be closer to a trial.

Lawyers on both sides argued over motions ahead of his trial, slated to begin June 10 if Nelson's defense team decides to waive a speedy trial.

This comes a little more than a week after a judge ruled him competent to stand trial.

Judge Keith White addressed Nelson about a speedy trial during Friday's status hearing.

""The speedy trial issue, it is my understanding that at this juncture, sir, you do not want to waive a speedy trial. Is that correct?"" White asked.

""That is correct,"" Nelson replied.

Nelson's defense team noted 22 motions Friday, more than half of which they requested to be dismissed.

One motion that was tabled until further information is available is the time in which Nelson would appear in court if his case went to trial.

Court documents state it's protocol for a person to be transported by 4 a.m. but Nelson's attorneys pushed to have that time moved to 8 a.m.

White advised the council at the jail make that decision.

Court will resume at 9 a.m. Monday morning.

The Sheriff's Office said Burnsed used the social media site Tumblr to upload child porn. While taking electronics from Burnsed's home into evidence, an investigator discovered child porn in the house.

Burnsed was charged with 10 counts of felony possession of child porn. A bond was not immediately set.

Burnsed's first court appearance was scheduled for Saturday.

Man missing from Columbia County since April 22,"COLUMBIA COUNTY, Fla. - Detectives with the Columbia County Sheriff's Office are asking for the public's help to locate a missing man.

John Robert Curtis ,55, was last seen on April 22, 2019 by his son.

Investigators said Curtis left in a 2006 white Hummer H2 with a Florida tag, but no one knows where he may have been going.

The Hummer he is driving does not have a rear tire on the back as most typically do.

The SUV has a Wounded Warrior decal on the back window and ""SANZY"" in metal lettering above the taillight on the body.

Anyone who sees Curtis or his vehicle is asked to call the Columbia County Sheriff's Office at 386-758-1095 and ask for Detective Green.

Man suspected of killing wife takes his life in standoff with authorities,"WESTON, Fla. - A man suspected of killing his wife in her Weston home this week killed himself late Thursday after a standoff with authorities in central Florida, deputies said.

Gina Carter, a spokeswoman for the Broward County Sheriff's Office, said the U.S. Marshal’s Task Force, Broward detectives and local authorities tracked 39-year-old Angel Garcia Sanchez to a home in Venus, a small town about 50 northeast of Fort Myers.

When deputies could not make contact with Sanchez, they entered the home and found Sanchez dead inside with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Carter said.

Investigators later determined that when a Highland County Sheriff's Office SWAT team vehicle approached the home, Sanchez fired several shots in their direction, but no one was struck, Carter said.

Sanchez is suspected of killing his wife, 34-year-old Carolyn Espinosa. She was found dead Wednesday inside her home in the 36000 block of San Simeon Circle. Carter said Espinosa and Sanchez had separated and were preparing to divorce.

Anyone with information about the case is asked to called Broward County Sheriff's Office homicide Detective Zach Scott at 954-3321-4162.

Arcade scamming device a first for St. Lucie County Sheriff's investigators,"CLOSE If you see a crime being committed, leave anonymous tips with Treasure Coast Crime Stoppers. GINNY BEAGAN/TCPALM April 2019 Ginny Beagan, TCPALM

ST. LUCIE COUNTY — An incident in which a woman apparently used an electronic device to scam an arcade is the first time St. Lucie County sheriff’s investigators have encountered such a device, according to an official Tuesday and an affidavit.

Karolyn Griffith, 30, of Sanford, was arrested May 3 on charges related to grand theft, fraud and giving false information to a law enforcement officer.

Deputies about 3:15 a.m. went to the Gold Rush arcade in the 6600 block of South U.S. 1 and spoke to Griffith, who investigators said tried to hide “a black electronic box with a red button and an antenna,” an affidavit states.

An employee said Griffith was winning too much money and it didn’t make sense.

Representatives at other arcades said they know of such devices.

Michael Shine said he manages the Tropicana arcade, which opened recently a short drive south of Gold Rush on the west side of U.S. 1

“We know that these devices are out there,” Shine said. “We haven’t seen them as of yet in our place, but we’re very tight on our security.”

Shine said there are different devices, with some incorporated into cell phones or garage door opening-type objects.

He described them as electro-magnetic pulse devices that can manipulate the credit counter in machines.

Investigators tested the Griffith's device. A deputy switched on the device and was able to add credits to one of the machines.

Shine suggested other arcades remain vigilant.

“People are less likely to do things when they feel like they’re being watched,” Shine said.

Meg Pizano works at 777 arcade in a plaza south of Shine’s business.

Pizano said she's heard of such devices. She said they have installed alarms on machines that go off when someone tries to use them.

“There’s all kinds of tricks in this business,” Pizano said.

Pizano said 90 percent of her business is regulars, and when a new face comes in, ""you watch them.

“That’s your job. We don’t know this person,” she said. “Nobody else knows this person.”

She said she talks to people, and asks questions.

In the Gold Rush case, the amount of money missing from the two machines totaled nearly $2,800.

A sheriff’s official said the case is the first time the agency has encountered such a device.

They ""are placed in close proximity to the gaming machine and use a radio frequency to manipulate the programming of the machine to add ‘credits,’” according to the sheriff’s office.

Griffith was the only person arrested, but investigators say it did not appear she was alone.

"Real spies, not James Bond, take spotlight at new spy museum","WASHINGTON (AP) - James Bond's shiny silver sports car - with its JB007 rotating license plate - is the first thing visitors see when they step into the new and improved International Spy Museum that opens Sunday in Washington. After that, it's as if the history of Hollywood's famous private eye vanishes in invisible ink, while the stories of real-life spies and modern-day espionage take center stage.

The old, cramped museum focused on human collection of intelligence. The new one also offers a window into covert operations, counterterrorism, intelligence analysis, cyber espionage, intelligence failures and even highly debated legal and ethical issues, such as waterboarding.

""We're not playing it safe as a museum,"" Vince Houghton, the museum's curator and historian, said during a sneak-peak tour of the $162 million, nonprofit museum. ""We don't get money from the government. We need to maintain our independence because there are a lot of stories we need to tell.""

Real intelligence officers tend to be tight-lipped, but at the museum, visitors can watch videos starring current or former intelligence officers talking about their jobs.

The top psychologist at the CIA talks about how trust and fear affect relationships between intelligence assets and their handlers. A former deputy CIA director discusses how spooks assessed the intelligence that led to the raid of a compound where al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011 in Pakistan. Real female spies dispel the myth that women rely on sex appeal to gather intelligence.

There's an exhibit featuring Morten Storm, a Danish man turned Islamic radical. He later became disenchanted with Islam and went to work for Danish intelligence as a double agent, providing information about wanted terror suspects. His life in the shadows became public in 2012.

""We went to the undisclosed location where he's hiding from al-Qaida and recorded him actually telling his own story surrounded by artifacts from his own life,"" Houghton said.

There are stories of deception and tragedy, intelligence coups and surprises, too.

Everybody knows that 007 was ""Bond. James Bond."" Fewer people know that America's first spymaster was President George Washington, a.k.a. Agent 711.

Both sides spied during the Revolutionary War during the 1770s, but at the end, the head of British intelligence operations Maj. George Beckwith stated: ""Washington did not beat us militarily, he simply outspied us.""

Washington helped coordinate intelligence operations during the war and the museum has a letter he wrote creating the first U.S. intelligence agency.

""It's the Magna Carta for American intelligence,"" Houghton said of his favorite artifact. ""It's the founding document and we have it. It's as cool as it gets.""

The old museum, which closed in 2018, had about 3,000 artifacts and could display about 600 of them at a time. The new spy museum has 10,000 artifacts, including more than 5,000 items donated by H. Keith Melton, a Florida businessman who spent years crisscrossing the globe to find and buy them. The roughly 1,000 spycraft artifacts that can be seen when the new museum opens include:

The ice-climbing ax used in the bloody assassination of Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky. A chunk of Gary Powers' U2 spy plane shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960. The handcuffs used to arrest John Anthony Walker Jr., a former Navy chief warrant officer convicted of spying for the Soviet Union from 1968 to 1985. A large piece of a tunnel that penetrated East Germany so that the U.S. and allies could tap Soviet and East German communications. Code-breaking equipment. Hidden cameras. A pregnant woman disguise. The Amber drone, a remotely piloted surveillance aircraft designed by an Israeli that is a forerunner to today's Predator, which executes airstrikes in Afghanistan and other hotspots around the globe.

Not everything is real. Upon entry, visitors can opt to get a cover identity and mission along with a badge with radio-frequency technology that will recognize them as they walk up to interactive exhibits throughout the museum. Their spy skills are tested throughout the tour and at the end they can find out if they're better suited to be an intelligence officer in the field, for example, or an analyst at CIA headquarters.

Visitors can create a disguise or climb inside a replica of a ""stress position"" interrogation box that's too narrow to sit down in and too low to stand up in. They can walk into an exhibit that recreates life under the secret police in East Germany before the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Without warning, a stern-looking Stasi police officer and police dog - actually a video behind glass - appear to be approaching to ask for papers.

""If you were interrogated harshly by the Stasi, chances are you would sweat,"" perhaps on the cushion of the chair while being questioned, Houghton said. ""They'd cut out a piece of the cushion and they'd have your scent. They put it in a scent jar and if they needed to track you down, the dogs would be able to go and find you.""",http://www.wjhl.com/news/real-spies-not-james-bond-take-spotlight-at-new-spy-museum/1986262854,2019-05-07T16:29:36Z,WJHL,"338 E Main St, Johnson City, TN 37601, USA"
Skirmish at North Fort Myers community over a Vietnam War memorial mural settled ... unhappily,"A skirmish between residents and management at a North Fort Myers development involving a memorial to the Vietnam War ended peacefully if not unhappily Tuesday.

The issue arose seemingly overnight when residents of the Del Tura Golf & Country Club began talking on social media sites about a mural on a garage door painted in black and depicting a Vietnam War-era soldier kneeling before a cross with a helicopter flying in the background.

Community officials sent Bob Masson, 71, a Vietnam War vet and the mural's owner, a letter asking him to remove the depiction. Apparently there also had been a complaint.

""It feels like I've been kicked in the head,"" Masson said. ""It feels like (his service in the war) meant nothing right now. It meant a lot to us when we were over there.""

Tuesday morning a group of residents gathered at the Del Tura clubhouse parking lot and started discussing the issue, which they said they thought was all about the military content of the mural.

Del Tura is a 55-and-over manufactured homes community on U.S. 41 in North Fort Myers.

""There's a lot of military veterans in here,"" Don Beavers, 60 and a veteran, said. ""It was on NextDoor and it just blew up yesterday. Everyone got involved last night.""

NextDoor is a social media site that developments such as Del Tura, gated communities and local communities can join to find out goings-on for their specific areas.

Richard Dzedzej, a resident at Del Tura, said the homeowner is a Vietnam veteran and was going to comply with the letter he received and paint over the picture.

""Other veterans told him that there is nothing wrong with it and to leave it intact,"" Dzedzej said.

Eventually Fred Taylor, the community manager, came out and addressed the residents.

""I'm happy to answer questions,"" Taylor told them. ""But not with the news present.""

Taylor told the group before moving inside the clubhouse that he was unaware they would be coming to meet with him with the news media present.

When questioned about the letter Taylor said Masson had not sought the proper approval despite community rules that disallow any mural on a garage door.

""I explained it is not the content of the graphic,"" Taylor said before asking the residents to meet with him in private. ""It is any graphic.""

Taylor pointed out that the community flies a POW flag on its main flagpole.

After the meeting the residents said they were satisfied but some were still a bit rankled that it was handled the way it was.

""I consider it unhappily settled,"" Dzedzej said. ""I understand the point but do think they could have let him keep it.""

Dzedzej's son Mike doesn't live at Del Tura but was visiting with his veteran dad and wasn't happy either.

""I think it's nonsense that he has to take it down,"" he said.

Masson, who has a flagpole with the POW and U.S. flags flying, and statues of military figures on his front lawn in basically the same configuration as the mural, said he put up the mural three months ago.

""I'm a military man all the way,"" Masson said. ""I'm just appalled that I have to take this off. It took them three months to send me the letter. But I see their point, they have a job to do.""

He said he was told he could keep the mural until Memorial Day and then replace it with a flag of the same topic or a plexiglass depiction and place it alongside the house. He said the brief battle won't prompt him to move.

""I have a lot of good friends, veterans, behind me 100 percent. I'm very disappointed,"" he said. ""But I'll get over it. ... I'll bite the bullet.""

"Golden State Killer investigator talks suspect’s strange behavior, launching true crime podcast ‘Murder Squad’","For retired cold case investigator-turned-podcast host Paul Holes, the arrest of the alleged Golden State Killer, who had eluded capture for decades, was a turning point in his career.

Joseph DeAngelo, 73, was taken into custody in 2018 based on DNA evidence linking him to at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes across California in the 1970s and ‘80s. He’s awaiting trial on 26 charges in a Sacramento jail since last April and has not entered a plea.

Holes, who was working on the case at the time, said DNA profiling techniques helped lead to an arrest. The Golden State Killer went undetected for years as he continued to break into his victims' homes to rape and murder them. It is believed his final victim was killed in 1986.

TED BUNDY'S EX-GIRLFRIEND INSPIRES FILM

“Once [DeAngelo] was placed in that interview room, he was in a posture that he did not move from for over an hour,” Holes recalled to Fox News. “He was absolutely motionless. He did a very slight movement and we’re like, ‘He’s moving!’ And then he would stop and freeze. I’ve never met anyone who’s been able to be so motionless for so long.”

“One of the female detectives said, ‘That’s what he was doing back in the day,’” continued Holes. “She was right. This was a guy who had the physical ability to go into somebody’s backyard, be in the shadows and just go absolutely motionless for hours while he’s watching what’s going on inside the house. Just seeing that, even though he’s an older man, you see this innate ability.”

According to authorities, the serial killer would sneak into suburban homes at night. If a couple was home, he would tie up the man, place dishes on his back and threaten to kill both victims if he heard the plates fall while he raped the woman.

SURVIVORS OF LARRY NASSAR'S SEXUAL ABUSE SPEAK OUT IN NEW DOC

Holes started his search for the killer as a fresh police academy graduate and forensic toxicologist in Contra Costa when he was in his 20s, The Sacramento Bee previously reported. The case ultimately became a career-long obsession — even all the way up until his retirement.

“I was actively investigating him and in my last days of being active, I drove up to his house and parked in front of his house the day before I was retired,” said Holes. “In reflection, it’s a good thing that I did not go and knock on his door that day. I considered it. Just to get a DNA sample and eliminate this guy. But who knows what would have happened if he recognized me and decided to do something.”

Holes shared that at that time, he did not think DeAngelo was the murderer, at least not yet. He was simply another person he was looking to possibly eliminate as part of his ongoing search.

“After I retired, we were close,” said Holes. “The guys that were active, that were a part of my team, basically kept me on as if I hadn’t retired. When we finally got the DNA sample that showed he was the Golden State Killer, I was brought in. Even though I was a retired officer at this time, they brought me in. I helped write the arrest warrant… I also gave thoughts and ideas about interview strategies. In many ways, I’m very thankful they did that. Because I got a lot of satisfaction of being involved in that process when technically, they would have said, ‘Nope, you’re no longer part of us.’”

GEORGIA WOMAN RECALLS MEETING SERIAL RAPIST FROM DATING APP IN DOC

Holes previously told the Mercury News in San Jose, Calif., that one of his team’s biggest tools was GEDMatch, a Florida-based website that pools DNA profiles that people upload and share publicly.

GEDMatch is a free site where users who have DNA profiles from commercial companies such as ancestry.com and 23andMe can expand their search for relatives.

Major companies, such as 23andMe and Ancestry, do not allow law enforcement to access their genetic data unless they get a court order, the Associated Press shared. Holes said officials did not need a court order to access GEDMatch’s large database of genetic blueprints.

“This investigative genealogy technique was everything to really catch him,” said Holes. “Using the information that we had in the case files, I went down so many different long paths, as did all the investigators… Using that DNA we had from the crime scene, it gave us the right direction. It gave us focus. So once we narrowed it down to a small group of individuals… It became pretty easy to figure out which guy it was. That turned out to be DeAngelo. Without this technique, I’m not sure we would have solved this case anytime soon… This case would have likely been an unsolved case today if I hadn’t stumbled upon this technique while I was involved with another case.”

FORMER CHILD BRIDE RECALLS MARRYING HER RAPIST AT AGE 13 IN DOC

But Holes still has the urge to solve crimes. In fact, he recently teamed up with investigative journalist Billy Jensen to launch a new podcast titled “The Murder Squad,” which features unsolved cases of missing persons or murders.

The duo first connected through writer Michelle McNamara, who was researching the Golden State Killer case before her passing in 2016 at age 46. Jensen helped finish her book, titled “I’ll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman’s Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer.”

“For me, I spent all my time in the last few years of being active pursuing the Golden State Killer,” explained Holes. “I did not realize what a part of my life that case was until DeAngelo was taken into custody.”

“I just felt this void,” he continued. “I wasn’t on the hunt like I was before. And that’s something I just need. That’s part of what makes this podcast so exciting. We’re going after these cases. I’m getting into the hunt mode again. It helps fill that void. It’s not the same, but it’s at least something that I can grasp onto, knowing I’m still trying to help people get answers about their loved ones. It won’t ever be the same, but this is why I keep going.”

CHARLES MANSON'S GRANDSON TELLS ALL

Holes said the hope is that listeners will deliver in new tips and theories for him to follow-up on with Jensen.

“We have some cases were we interviewed family members,” said Holes. “They are just estate about the idea that their loved one’s case is still being pursued… They are all for it and have been very cooperative in terms of coming on our show and talking about what was going on with the victim and the victim’s life around the time the crime occurred.”

“There’s that possibility [listeners] can make a difference,” added Holes. “Just like I made a difference with the Golden State Killer… There are other individuals out there who have that same drive to make a difference.”

Outside firm may represent Sarasota deputy accused of shattering man's face,"The potential cost to taxpayers is unknown.

SARASOTA COUNTY — The county is looking to lawyer up with an outside firm to represent a Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office deputy in a civil suit alleging that he body slammed a homeless man in custody, leaving him with a partially shattered face that required surgery to fix.

The county attorney’s office at Tuesday’s Sarasota County Commission meeting plans to ask the board to allow the office to hire an outside law firm to represent Deputy Shaun Martin, who is accused of slamming Michael Basile head first onto the concrete floor of the Sarasota County jail's booking area in 2015. The county attorney’s office is going to represent Deputy Michael McMahan and Sheriff Tom Knight, who are also named as defendants in the case. County Attorney Frederick Elbrecht in an April 30 memo to the commission wrote it is appropriate for the law firm of Burgess, Harrell, Mancuso, Colton and La Porta to represent Martin to avoid a potential conflict with the county attorney’s office.

“Because of the nature of the allegations in the complaint, there would be a potential conflict if the office of the county attorney were to also represent Deputy Martin in addition to Sheriff Knight and Deputy McMahan,” the memo states.

It’s unclear how much the outside firm could cost and what kind of conflict could arise if the county attorney’s office represented all three defendants.

The county attorney’s office declined to comment Monday on the pending litigation.

Failure to reach a settlement could cost the county more than $100,000 in attorney’s fees and court costs through a trial if litigation is successful, Basile’s attorney Robert Watrous wrote in a letter to the county attorney’s office on March 8.

Basile, who filed the lawsuit on March 19, is seeking $200,000 in damages after he sustained severe facial injuries following the incident, which was captured by video surveillance cameras.

“Basile briefly lost consciousness after his head struck the ground and remained motionless on the floor, visibly bleeding, until medical care was rendered to him,” the suit states. “As a direct result of the excessive force, Basile was taken to Sarasota Memorial Hospital where surgery was performed to repair traumatic injury to the bone of the eye socket, the removal of several teeth, a bone graft and the installation of metal hardware placed inside the orbit and along the zygomatic arch of Basile’s left eye socket.”

Basile alleges Martin and McMahan also filed a false police report against Basile, initiating a criminal prosecution, which was later dropped.

The county this year offered Basile a $5,000 settlement that he declined, a representative of the law firm representing Basile told the Herald-Tribune in March.

Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Kaitlyn Perez in March said the agency is contesting the allegations and referred all inquiries to the former county attorney, who declined to comment.

Basile wasn’t cooperating with deputies as they processed his arrest on a disorderly intoxication misdemeanor on March 27, 2015, according to sheriff’s reports. Martin told internal affairs investigators that Basile was being verbally threatening to deputies during the booking process and that he held the prisoner from behind by his arms.

Martin claims Basile “horse stomped” on his foot and kicked him in his knee, which had just been surgically repaired. Then, in one swift move, the deputy slammed the man to the floor, face first.

A booking video showing the toss did not capture Basile’s alleged assault.

According to a sheriff’s report, Martin said he took Basile to the ground to “gain compliance.” He described the drunken man’s injuries as “a cut to his face.”

Basile was charged with battery on a police officer, a felony more serious than the intoxication charge for which he had been arrested by the Sarasota Police Department. He remained in jail for nearly five months, until Assistant State Attorney Rebekah Bragg reviewed the case.

During the internal investigation, Martin stated he did not mean to injure Basile during the takedown, but felt it was an appropriate response to being kicked by Basile. When questioned about other tactics that could have been used, which would not have caused injury, Martin said he did not consider other tactics.

Investigators determined there was sufficient information to sustain allegations of excessive force. Martin was suspended for 36 hours without pay, and retraining was ordered for the deputy.

Basile has been arrested 49 times since he moved to Florida in 1996. Some of the charges include marijuana possession, disorderly intoxication, drinking in public, weapons violations, battery, trespass and “lodging out of doors.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190506/outside-firm-may-represent-sarasota-deputy-accused-of-shattering-mans-face?rssfeed=true,2019-05-06T14:13:23Z,Sarasota Herald,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA"
A stroke averted: Innovative 3D model key in successful aneurysm surgery for William Golden Sr.,"William Jerome Golden Sr. tends to fill the room he enters. Well over 6 feet, finely-muscled, at 44 he looks like what he used to be, a basketball player at Godby High School. For the last 24 years he has worn the uniform of a manager at a Super Lube shop. Since 2005, when not running that store, he has managed to also develop what he calls his “entrepreneurial business,” Golden Touch Enterprises, doing home maintenance and landscaping.

No doubt about it, William Golden, a hard-worker and father of four, was a man going places, doing things, filling his future with plans. That is, until he almost had all of those plans cancelled by something deep inside his head.

Sitting in an office at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare on a recent Monday, Golden is holding something most people might find macabre. It is white, made of a kind of plastic, and is an exact replica of Golden’s lower skull, cervical vertebrae and curling blood vessels. He turns his “skull” over and over in his hands, quiet as he examines it, perhaps for a moment overcome with memories.

“That’s your head and that is the aneurysm that was repaired,” says Rob Fisher, RN, Neuroscience Service Line Administrator at TMH. Fisher has become a kind of ""lynchpin"" in TMH’s use of a dramatically new modality and how doctors and patients are able to visualize the body.

“This is exactly where the doctors were able to thread the stent,” says Fisher pointing to an enlarged section of a blood vessel lying near the base of Golden’s ‘skull.’ “And it’s all made through the use of 3D printing based on CT, MRIs, angiograms or PET scans of the patient.”

Severe headache symptoms

Prior to coming to Tallahassee, Rob Fisher had been doing international consulting, he says, working with Barts Hospital in London and an Irish company called, Axial. Axial was an innovative organization that had pioneered 3-D printed facsimiles of boney, vascular and soft tissue parts, as well as visualizing metallic appliances for use in complicated surgeries.

These ""real life"" models allow surgeons to turn their surgical sites any direction in their own hands, to know the anatomy from different angles before entering the body, and which are accurate, says Fisher, to 1/1000 millimeter. Fisher introduced the concept to the stroke team physicians at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare.

Back in 2017 William Golden had been having trouble with what he thought were sinus headaches. “I’d been to the Emergency Room several times,” he says. “The headaches were really bad… but sinus problems can hurt too.” An alert Emergency Room physician decided that there might be more to the repeat visits, and shortly, a CT scan revealed not an infected sinus cavity, but a dangerous cerebral aneurysm in Golden’s head.

Aneurysms come in a variety of types and are caused by a weakening of a blood vessel’s wall to make a bulge or distension. The most common aneurysm resembles “a berry” that hangs from a twig. Not all aneurysms require immediate intervention, but some do.

From then until January of this year, he worked with Dr. Lawson and others at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital for treatment.

Planning for surgery

Enter Dr. Matthew Lawson, a neurosurgeon and Stroke Medical Director at the Tallahassee Neurological Clinic and TMH. “Without intervention, Mr. Golden was at risk for two kinds of stroke — thrombotic and hemorrhagic. Based on the size and location of Golden’s aneurysm, it necessitated treatment.”



Using modern techniques that allow for intercranial repairs without externally entering the skull, Dr. Lawson threaded a catheter from William Golden’s groin into the vessels of his head. An angiogram was done, injecting dye to show on X-ray exactly the configuration of the vessels that would be treated.

But Dr. Lawson says the angiogram revealed something he hadn’t expected. This kind of aneurysm was different. Called a dissecting pseudoaneurysm, instead of the full thickness of the vessel bulging, here the inner wall had failed, and only thin connective tissue was keeping the entire vessel from hemorrhaging into the brain.

Dr. Lawson realized his plan for treating the problem with traditional aneurysm coiling was not going to be the best option.

For the moment, the surgery was halted and a new plan would be devised.

Rethinking the operation

Back in the TMH office, William Golden, still holding the 3D version of his skull, grows quiet, fighting back the emotions that overwhelm him as he remembers awakening to find he has not been made better; that he and his doctor would have to embark on a new and potentially more dangerous course of treatment.

Dr. Lawson too would pursue all the information he could gather. “I consulted with several surgeons around the country and though not usual, together it seemed that using a different kind of device called a ‘Pipeline’ stent would make sense.” Here, the stent would ‘by-pass’ and ‘wall-off’ the ruptured area allowing the aneurysm to clot and heal on its own.

For William Golden, the aborted surgery had given him pause and it took a while for him to conclude that he would undergo the second attempt at his aneurysm’s repair. “I had faith in Dr. Lawson,” he says now. “I appreciated that he took the time to do it the right way and not take risks.”

From Lawson’s point of view, he says that, “For surgeons, these 3D replicas are helpful in seeing the exact curvature of blood vessels, their proximity to other brain structures, and importantly, to explain clearly to patients what is involved.”

Faith and success

The second surgery was performed. Golden says he leaned on his faith — and his trust in his doctors. The second surgery was a success.

Today, as William Golden readies to get a bite of lunch and get back to Super Lube duties, he looks the picture of health. His doctor tells him that his risk for stroke is “close to zero.” Untreated, it would have remained “very high.”

He will stay on blood pressure medication and be monitored for the next four years. Promising to watch his diet and follow a healthy lifestyle, he smiles that he has gained back the 20 pounds he had lost during his ordeal. And that seems just fine.

Golden softly jokes that he just wasn’t “ready to go yet.” But watching him handle the 3-D version of his own head and how he buries his brow in his hands remembering his journey with Dr. Lawson and the TMH Stroke Team, the depth of his gratitude is quietly and powerfully revealed. And the Team says it is only glad to be there for patients like Golden — a man with things to do!

Pilots made runway change before jet hit Florida river,"Pilots of a chartered jet that ran into a river at a Florida military base made a last-minute change to the runway where they would make a landing, a federal investigator said Sunday.

The pilots on the Miami Air International plane requested the change to air traffic controllers shortly before landing at Naval Air Station Jacksonville Friday night.

The 9,000-foot-long runway where the Boeing 737 landed was essentially limited to 7,800 feet since there was a wire barrier set up to recover Navy aircraft in instances they couldn't land on a carrier during training, said Bruce Landsberg, vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.

""We don't know what they were thinking or why they made that choice,"" Landsberg said at a news conference. ""That will be one of the things we look to find out.""

NTSB investigators said they hope a cockpit voice recorder helps them answer that question, but they have been unable to recover it yet since the part of the plane where it's located is still underwater in the St. Johns River. Investigators also plan to interview the pilots, Landsberg said.

Investigators have retrieved the flight data recorder.

There were no serious injuries on the flight from a military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, although almost two dozen of the 143 passengers and crew members sought medical attention for minor injuries. A 3-month-old baby was hospitalized overnight for observation in an abundance of caution.

Cell phone video from passenger Darwing Silva captured the immediate, uncertain moments after the chartered jet landed.

A passenger shouted ""Watch out! Watch out!"" as other passengers and crew members cautiously walked out on a wing of the plane. Another passenger shouted, ""Baby coming through!"" and a man can be seen holding an infant in his arms as he walks along the other passengers in yellow life jackets getting drenched by rain.

Silva shared the video with Jacksonville television station News4Jax.

Silva told the Tampa Bay Times that passengers initially were told Friday the aircraft might not be fit for takeoff. Then the flight was cleared to leave Cuba, but with the warning there would be no air conditioning.

Even though the plane was hot, there were no other problems during the flight from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Silva said.

The landing at Naval Air Station Jacksonville seemed normal at first, but then the plane didn't stop on the runway. There was a loud bang, he hit his head on the ceiling, and the jet ended up in the water, Silva said.

He looked down and his ankles were in water, he said, and he heard someone yell, ""Fuel!""

Silva said he helped usher people out an emergency door onto a wing.

The NTSB has assigned 16 investigators to determine what happened.

First-responders were at the plane within a couple minutes of its landing, said Capt. Michael Connor, the base's commanding officer.

""Everyone was very cordial,"" Connor said. ""There wasn't any commotion or panic. Everyone was very calm.""

On Sunday, Miami Air International, which operated the aircraft, notified passengers that their overhead luggage from the plane was available for pickup. The airline said passengers would be contacted directly once their checked bags were retrieved.

Also Sunday, a small, one-propeller airplane crashed into the St. Johns River in Jacksonville.

Pit bull recovering after being dragged by truck in Spring Hill,"Pit bull recovering after being dragged by truck in Spring Hill Video

Spring Hill, FLA - HERNANDO COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - A young pit bull is recovering after he was allegedly dragged by a rope that was tied to the back of a pickup truck bumper, witnesses told News Channel 8.

It happened at the intersection of Northcliffe Boulevard and Franconia Avenue in Spring Hill on Friday morning.

Jan Harwood, the owner of Nature Coast Animal Wellness and Surgery Center in Weeki Wachee, said she watched as the dog was dragged by a truck that was going 30 to 40 miles per hour, and hurled onto the road.

Harwood and another man in a van pulled over as the driver of the truck drove away.

She said the pit bull, which she named ""Ollie,"" had severe road rash all over his body. The pads of his feet were worn off.

Harwood said the van owner brought the injured dog to her clinic, which is just up the highway and a veterinarian performed X-rays and ultrasounds. The vet said Ollie had no broken bones or internal injuries, which is amazing, considering the traumatic incident he had just been through.

“He was beating the ground with such velocity and such a high rate of speed, so he was being pulled along and then when the driver of the truck decided to make a turn, luckily when he made that turn, the dog's head slipped out of the collar. It was attached to the rope,” Harwood said.

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office is searching for an older, beat up, blue pickup truck with furniture in the back.

In the meantime, “Ollie"" is being fostered at a vet tech's house and might be available for adoption once he is healed.",http://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/pit-bull-injured-after-being-dragged-by-pick-up-truck-in-spring-hill/1979071412,2019-05-05T11:00:08Z,WFLA,"200 S Parker St, Tampa, FL 33606, USA"
Deion Sanders' long-awaited return to Fort Myers leads to reconciliation and apology,"CLOSE Deion Sanders, a North Fort Myers High School graduate, shares portions of his life story with the community on Saturday at Fort Myers High School. Kinfay Moroti, The News-Press USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA

Deion Sanders' return to Fort Myers Saturday was an effort at reconciliation with his hometown.

The two-time Super Bowl winner and World Series player was awarded a key to the city during a community forum Saturday night at Fort Myers High School.

The relationship between Sanders, 51, and the city he grew up in has been a rocky one. It included failed business proposals like a 2005 attempt to build affordable housing where it's needed the most and an arrest for trespassing and fishing on a private lake near Southwest Florida International Airport.

But on Saturday night, all of that appeared to be forgotten as Sanders was welcomed on stage with a standing ovation with audience members cheering loudly for him.

""You are indeed a hometown hero,"" said Fort Myers Mayor Randy Henderson.

The event was attended by about 150 people and their recognition of Sanders prompted the NFL Hall of Famer, known as Prime Time, to apologize to his childhood city.

""This is long overdue. This is like a reconciliation for me,"" Sanders said. ""The reason it hurt so bad was because I don't give a damn what they say about me in Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, New York,"" Sanders said. ""I don't care because it was my job ... When you talk about me, some things I let slide, but you are all family. You only get one shot at calling the place home.""

""Thank you from the bottom of my heart,"" Sanders said. ""God was saying reconciliation. This has been reconciliation and a spirit of peace since I got here.""

""I apologize to you as well. You have no idea what you all did to me this particular weekend. The best is yet to come.""

For his return, Sanders brought with him Dallas-area Pastor Omar Jahwar to hold Prime's Community Correction, an intelligence gathering forum meant to understand the problems that the city of Fort Myers faces. On Sunday, Sanders was set to host his Prime Elite Underclassmen Camp for local athletes at Bishop Verot High School.

The Saturday night talk was a fact-finding mission but included little details on how to help the city. Sanders promised to return.

Violence, poverty, lack of opportunity are some of the factors that lead to violence in a community, Jahwar said.

""Social civility is available to young people even when they don't understand it,"" Jahwar said. ""Violence becomes the language of those who are underserved.""

Jahwar mentored Antong Lucky, founder and former leader of the Dallas 415 Bloods gang, and the two are now part of Urban Specialists, a group that looks to use the experience of former gang members as the best way to keep others from that life.

""The key thing for us to do, especially people who are trying to help, is to listen,"" Lucky said. ""You've got to hear what people want without judging them.""

Lucky said violence, drug dealing and gangs become part of the equation because of proximity. It's what they see in their community, Lucky said, and it's a cycle that continues.

Unless you are Sanders.

Sanders grew up in Dunbar, but at an early age said he would stay away from drugs and alcohol to remain focused on sports and school.

""I am only up here right now because I had a plan,"" Sanders said. ""I did not allow anyone out there to affect my plan.""

Sanders was almost brought to tears when he spoke about his mom, Connie Knight, and the long work hours she put in at Lee Memorial Hospital.

Sanders also thanked her for exposing him to life outside of his neighborhood. He said she would take the North Fort Myers High School graduate for drives down McGregor Boulevard and to Naples. The exposure to a different life showed him what was possible.

""I was exposed to so much that I had a choice so I didn’t fall prey,"" he said. ""I had seen another way. That influence changed my life.""

Henderson said Sanders' ""message quite frankly was one of the most powerful messages I have witnessed in my adult life.""

His apology was an ""outward demonstration"" of his character.

""I'm not sure that was necessary, but he felt that was necessary and that's what I respect and I honor that,"" Henderson said.

For Lehigh Senior High football coach James Chaney, it was good for his students to have the benefit of seeing Sanders talk about his accomplishments. Chaney also played with Sanders at North Fort Myers and at Florida State University.

Chaney said he was grateful for Sanders' return and the past should remain in the past.

But, he said, it's important to remember there are men in Dunbar and Fort Myers who are working to make change for others.

""I don't ever want to discount what the average man has done for our kids,"" Chaney said. ""You don't have to be a NFL player to give back and I feel (Sanders) feels that, too.""

Earnest Graham, football coach at Evangelical Christian School and former NFL player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said Sanders appears to be ""a man of purpose"" and will get things done.

Fort Myers councilwoman Terolyn Watson is hoping the city and Sanders can move forward and facilitate the changes that are needed.

""I think Deion's main message tonight is the choices you make in life can make a difference,"" Watson said. ""He's one of our most successful people. He has a great story. He's a great role model.""

Darrell Rowe, 14, was excited to see Sanders in person. He plays football and basketball and participates in track.

""He's someone I can look up to, someone who made it out,"" the Oak Hammock Middle School student said. ""I can do the same thing and I can make it out.""

Man killed during internet cafe robbery was US Marine,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The girlfriend of a man who was shot while trying to thwart a robbery at a Jacksonville internet cafe is praying for a quick arrest.

Lisa Fighter said her boyfriend, Douglas Cox, a U.S. Marine, did what he could to save a life, but lost his own life in the process. She said Cox was killed while trying to stop an armed robber Wednesday evening at the Dream Arcade on Edgewood Avenue.

""He's gone,"" Fighter said. ""He isn't going to make anybody laugh or smile or giggle anymore.""

Fighter relived the moment she learned what happened.

""We (were) going to McDonald's and we came across and saw the cops and our friends' SUV that they were in,"" Fighter said. ""He just looked at me and I could tell. I hit my knees and he said he was gone. There's nothing more that could be done.""

Cox, 47, was a regular at the Dream Arcade. Barry Jackson was there on the night of the shooting and called his friend's actions heroic.

""They were going to go in there and kill that woman, and he jumped in,"" Jackson said. ""Got the bullet before she did.""

According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, only one employee was inside the internet cafe at the time and no one else was injured.

""He died doing what he believed in,"" Fighter said.

The deadly shooting is one recent example in a string of violence at Jacksonville internet cafes. Early Friday morning, the Wilson Arcade on Wilson Boulevard was robbed by two masked gunmen.

As of Thursday night, no arrests were announced. Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 904-630-0500 or email JSOCrimeTips@jaxsheriff.org. To remain anonymous, contact Crime Stoppers at 1-866-845-TIPS (8477).

Last month, Aguirre's lawyers were back in court asking for state money after his murder conviction was set aside.

Aguirre was originally convicted of killing two Altamonte Springs women in 2004. The Florida Supreme Court set the conviction aside in 2016 and ordered a new trial.

The state first said it would retry the case, but then decided to drop it last November.

The state opposed the request for an estimated $700,000, saying the defense needed to file for the payment within 90 days of the court setting aside his original conviction.

The defense argued back, saying since the state planned a new trial for Aguirre, and he had to stay behind bars during that time, the 90 days shouldn't start until his actual release.

In his ruling, Judge John Galluzzo wrote, ""Mr. Aguirre had everything necessary to file the petition --"" once his conviction was set aside.

Galluzzo said, ""Mr. Aguirre's petition was filed well beyond the 90 days.""

The state attorney said in a written statement that the judge followed the law, and that only the legislature can extend the time for filing a claim, not a judge.

Florida man accused of bilking clients seeking pregnancy surrogates,"COLLEGE PARK, Md. — A Florida man faces charges in Maryland that he defrauded clients of a company that offered to help locate and financially support pregnancy surrogates for people trying to become parents.

Gregory Ray Blosser, 37, was arrested Monday in Florida on a wire fraud charge and detained until a Friday hearing in Miami, according to federal prosecutors.

Blosser has operated The Surrogacy Group since 2012, with offices in Annapolis, Maryland, and Tampa, Florida. Clients paid Blosser tens of thousands of dollars to find surrogates and support them during pregnancies. Blosser failed to either locate suitable surrogates or pay for their fees or medical expenses after clients deposited money into escrow accounts, a criminal complaint says.

""The victims were not able to obtain refunds, despite numerous attempts by phone and e-mail,"" a Justice Department press release says. ""Victims whose surrogates were not paid by Blosser had to pay the surrogates directly, even though they had provided funds to Blosser for that purpose.""

An assistant federal public defender who represented Blosser at his initial court appearance Tuesday didn't immediately respond to a telephone call seeking comment Friday.

Blosser's victims include seven clients from Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Australia and Germany who collectively paid Blosser approximately $200,000, according to an FBI agent's affidavit.

""The allegations in this case are especially egregious because they involve someone taking advantage of individuals who are trying to become parents,"" U.S. Attorney Robert Hur, of the District of Maryland, said in a statement. ""Criminals who line their pockets through such heartless deceit will be held accountable.""

Blosser also faces civil lawsuits in Maryland and Florida, including complaints filed by the attorney general's offices in both states.

An investigation by Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody's office concluded that The Surrogacy Group and Blosser collected approximately $270,000 from clients for services they didn't render.

""The Surrogacy Group and (Blosser) portray themselves as trusted guides, but for many they have betrayed this trust by taking tens of thousands of dollars and then abruptly stopping services or providing no services at all,"" the Florida complaint says.

On April 22, a circuit court judge in Maryland issued a temporary restraining order barring Blosser from selling surrogacy-related services in the state, according to state Attorney General Brian Frosh's office.

The FBI has set up a webpage to identify and contact other clients who may have been defrauded by Blosser and The Surrogacy Group.

A federal magistrate judge ordered Blosser released on $100,000 bond after his detention hearing Friday, according to a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Miami.

Blosser, a resident of Tampa, is expected to make his initial court appearance in Maryland on May 17. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted of the wire fraud charge.",https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20190503/florida-man-accused-of-bilking-clients-seeking-pregnancy-surrogates?rssfeed=true,2019-05-03T15:58:17Z,Daytona Beach News,"901 6th St, Daytona Beach, FL 32117, USA"
Person of interest sought in drive-by after gunfire narrowly...,"ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. - The morning after drive-by bullets barely missed a child on a couch in a West Augustine home, a man was spotted walking through a nearby apartment complex openly carrying a gun, investigators said.

They need to know who that man is.

Surveillance video showed the man ""brazenly"" walking through the complex with the handgun and then putting the gun inside a vehicle parked at the complex, according to the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office.

Investigators said the owner of the car refused to allow a voluntary search, but after they got a warrant, they found a 9mm Glock pistol with a 33-round extended magazine (pictured) hidden under the front seat.

They said the gun was reported stolen in Jacksonville earlier this year.

Deputies think the man seen in the surveillance video may be connected to an incident overnight Monday on Scheidel Way that sent bullets flying into a home.

Several bullet holes were found in the home and shell casings were found outside, deputies said.

Multiple rounds hit a couch inside the home, narrowly missing a 9-year-old. Multiple young children were inside the home, including a 1-year-old, deputies said.

""They found nine shots outside, six inside and two shots that hit the couch where my grandson was laying,"" homeowner Leslie Harden told News4Jax. ""For a grandmother, that's a lot.""

""You know, I just want to grab my grandson and hug him. Thank God he was all right,"" she added.

Harden had words for whoever pulled the trigger.

""Why would you do this?"" she said. ""You could have killed an innocent child.""

Anyone who might have been in the area between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m. Monday and saw anything suspicious, including vehicles or people, is asked to contact detectives at 1-888-277-TIPS (8477) or tips@sjso.org. You can remain anonymous and could be eligible for a $5,000 reward if the information provided leads to an arrest.

""If you know something or saw something, say something,"" said Sheriff's Office spokesperson Chuck Mulligan.

Detectives think the man in the surveillance video could be from Duval or St. Johns counties because the gun he was carrying was stolen from Duval County and the owner of the car he left the gun in currently lives in Duval County.

Anyone who might know the man's identity is asked to call Detective Jon Dees with the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office Major Crimes Unit at 904-209-2130 or if you would like to remain anonymous and be eligible for a reward, contact Crime Stoppers at 1-888-277-TIPS (8477) or TIPS@SJSO.ORG. Reward eligibility for information leading to an arrest is up to $5,000.

Police: Woman stops to help jogger when suspicious stranger approaches,"LAKE CITY, Fla. - A Lake City woman is being praised for spotting what might have been a dangerous situation for a female jogger and stepping in to help.

The woman said she saw a man driving a pickup truck slow down next to the jogger, who was running on the sidewalk along Southwest McLane Avenue.

The woman said when the man pulled off to the side of the road, she slowed down to keep an eye on things. The man then got out of the truck and approached the jogger.

The man was described as an older white male in his mid-40s to early 50s, wearing a dark ball cap and blue jeans.

When the woman saw him approaching the jogger, she honked and called the jogger over to ask if she knew the man and make sure everything was OK. The jogger said she didn't know him and thanked the woman for stopping.

While they were talking, the man got back in his truck and drove away.

The woman stayed with the jogger until the truck had driven out of sight.

“It is of the utmost importance to be aware of our surroundings,” said Dr. Argatha Gilmore, chief of police for Lake City. “Assisting fellow citizens in this manner is how we keep our community safe. If you see something, say something.”

"The Daily 202: Nervous about saber rattling on Venezuela, this GOP senator wants to wrest war powers from Trump","Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) rides the Senate subway to a vote. (Al Drago/Bloomberg)

With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: With so much attention on the Senate Intelligence Committee’s subpoena of Donald Trump Jr. and the House’s battles with President Trump over executive privilege, another consequential fight related to separation of powers has been playing out this week almost entirely under the radar.

Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution explicitly states that Congress shall declare war. Many lawmakers appear ambivalent about, or even resigned to, outsourcing one of their core job duties to the executive branch, especially when their party controls the White House.

Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) is not one of them. The chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee is angry that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has refused to commit that Trump will even consult with Congress before intervening militarily in Venezuela. Young is pushing for the Foreign Relations Committee, on which he sits, to schedule an immediate hearing to demand answers from administration officials regarding the possible use of military force in South America.

“Look, I acknowledge that there is a brutal socialist regime that the Venezuelans have been suffering under,” Young said in an extended interview about this issue. “I commend them and want to be supportive of Venezuelans for standing up for their freedom and for their basic human rights. But I think that it is the responsibility of the administration to explain their thinking as it relates to any plans to deploy U.S. forces to Venezuela.”

Young said the Trump team must answer “very basic” questions, such as: “What would our military's mission be in Venezuela? Would it be a stabilization mission or a humanitarian mission or some other sort of mission? Would we be seeking regime change? What would success look like militarily and then in the wake of military action? What legal authorities might the administration be considering to justify military force?”

The senator believes that the administration should seek authorization from Congress before putting boots on the ground. Young is not a dove in the mold of libertarian Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). He’s willing to use force, but he said he’s first and foremost an institutionalist.

Young was one of seven Republican senators who voted for the resolution to cut off U.S. support for the Saudi-backed war in Yemen. It was the first time Congress has ever invoked the War Powers Act to rein in military action. Trump vetoed the resolution, and the Senate failed last week to override it.

-- Asked on the Sunday shows whether Trump believes he has the power to intervene against Nicolás Maduro without congressional approval, Pompeo declined to answer directly. “The president has his full range of Article 2 authorities, and I’m very confident that any action we took in Venezuela would be lawful,” he said on ABC. “Make no mistake, we have a full range of options that we’re preparing for. Diplomatic options, political options, options with our allies, and then ultimately, a set of options that would involve use of U.S. military.”

-- Trump himself has soured on deploying military resources to the region following the failure of a U.S.-backed effort to oust Maduro last week. He’s complained that he was misled about how easy it would be to replace the socialist strongman and groused that national security adviser John Bolton wants to get him “into a war.” The events of April 30 have effectively shelved serious discussion of a heavy U.S. military response, current and former officials as well as outside advisers told my colleagues Anne Gearan, Josh Dawsey, John Hudson and Seung Min Kim.

-- But many key Republicans on the Hill remain open to using force. I wrote last week about the emergence of Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) as a leading proponent for deploying U.S. military resources in Venezuela. Others have also expressed support for the hard line being orchestrated by Bolton. “I don’t care about voting on the use of force,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told Politico this week.

With characteristic understatement, Young replied when we talked: “I have read a couple of my colleagues’ statements as it relates to this issue in the press. They don't seem to align perfectly with my own views related to the need for Congress to fully vet any potential military action, but I have not had conversations to get clarity with respect to their thinking. … Most importantly, I've read the Constitution.”

-- Young’s experiences in the military and in the House were formative and inspired his focus on checking executive power over matters of war and peace. The 46-year-old enlisted in the Navy after high school. He won an appointment to the Naval Academy in Annapolis a year later. After graduating in 1995, he accepted a commission in the Marine Corps. He trained as a rifle platoon commander, served as an intelligence officer and left the service as a captain in 2000. “Over the course of my service, I had interactions periodically with colonels and generals,” he recalled. “I came to appreciate that they are impressive human beings but mortal and capable of error, just like the rest of us.”

Young rode the red wave in the 2010 midterms and joined the House as Republicans claimed a majority. “I was a member of the House Armed Services Committee and observed that many of my colleagues seem to accept as gospel, or without critical inquiry, oftentimes very vague and unsatisfactory explanations pertaining to the utilization or intended utilization of military force and the deployment of our nation’s finest,” the senator said. “I always found that overawe by members of Congress when they interact with professional military personnel – that sense of, oftentimes, intimidation – to be frustrating. Because our job is to oversee the military!”

As a junior House member at the start of this decade, Young focused on figuring out the war in Afghanistan and found himself struggling to get clarity from the brass on America’s strategy. “It was frustrating to me that I received unsatisfactory answers,” he said. “I began reflecting based on those personal experiences that over the past two decades we've had constant reminders of the party in the White House ignoring Congress when it comes to authorizing military force.”

When Young won a promotion to the Senate in 2016 – replacing Dan Coats, who is now Trump’s director of national intelligence, and defeating Evan Bayh, who was trying to win back his old seat – he decided to do something about it. “It was my intention to put Congress back in the driver's seat,” he said. “We just have been failing to do our job as an institution as it pertains to authorizing force and then formally ending said authorizations. … That lays the foundation for my interest in Venezuela.”

I noted to Young that the strongest opposition to U.S. military action against Venezuela seems to be coming from generals at the Pentagon. “That's not uncommon,” he said. “In the end, it's really not the military's decision. We should not give carte blanche to our men and women in uniform to make that call. We should give great respect and credence to their testimony because they are trained military professionals. But we mustn't forget that we have a civilian-controlled military.”

Young’s perspective recalls the former French prime minister Georges Clemenceau’s declaration after World War I that war is too important to be left to the generals.

-- The fight over Congress’s role in authorizing the use of military force is much bigger than Trump or any single president. Sen. Tim Kaine was one of Barack Obama’s closest allies in Congress. As governor of Virginia, he had offered a critical early endorsement of the young Illinois senator and then served as his handpicked chairman of the Democratic National Committee. But Kaine, elected to the Senate in 2012, stood up to Obama on war powers, publicly and privately, on principle.

Efforts to pass a new authorization for the use of military force against the Islamic State have perennially faltered over complicated divisions between and within the parties. Many Republicans frequently criticized Obama for arguing that he didn’t need to seek congressional authorization before supporting the bombings of Libya. But they’ve muted themselves during the Trump era.

Kaine, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2016, spent the past few years working with then-Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) to pass a bill that would authorize the use of military force against the Islamic State without giving the president carte blanche to fight endless wars in the Middle East. But both Corker and Flake left at the end of the year.

“Having Corker and Flake gone really hurts because they were institutionalists,” Kaine said in an interview this week. “I could always count on Corker and Flake. If we didn't necessarily agree on the endpoint, we at least agreed that Article 1 oversight is critical. … They were not patsies for the president. They were supporters of the president, and they generally voted with the president, but they wanted to uphold the institutional role of the Senate. So we miss them. We really miss them.”

Kaine hopes that Young can pick up the torch. The two introduced a bill together in March that would repeal the authorizations for the use of military force (known as AUMFs) against Iraq that passed Congress in 1991 and 2002.

Kaine said he’s become pessimistic about rewriting the AUMF that passed immediately after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, because of strong resistance. “But this one should seem to be easy,” he said.

Young marveled that the resolution that authorized Desert Storm is still on the books. “These sorts of authorities, without a great stretch of the imagination, could be used in the future to justify military action,” said the senator, who went to law school after departing the Marine Corps.

-- Cully Stimson, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who studies these issues closely, applauded the Young-Kaine bill as long overdue. Stimson, a third-generation naval officer, noted that there are both American troops and members of the Islamic State who they are trying to kill that were not alive on 9/11. He added that half the members of the Senate weren’t there in 2002 when the last AUMF passed. “There’s a reluctance by some – because this really is serious business – not to repeal any AUMF willy-nilly. But Kaine and Young are not doing this willy-nilly,” said Stimson, who coordinated the Pentagon’s global detention policy and operations, including at Guantanamo Bay and in Iraq and Afghanistan, during George W. Bush’s administration. “It’s a matter of congressional hygiene and good housekeeping to tidy things up.”

-- Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James Risch (R-Idaho) got the gavel in January when Corker left town. His own worldview does not neatly fit into any of the traditional boxes like Jacksonian or Jeffersonian, nationalist or neoconservative, but the new chairman now finds himself refereeing intraparty debates about Trump’s national security policy. He leads a committee of heavy hitters. Of the 10 Republicans on his committee besides Young, five have run for president: Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul.

-- Risch’s spokeswoman confirmed that he and Young discussed Venezuela on Monday and said they will have more information to share in the coming days about a potential hearing. Young said the Idahoan has been receptive and responsive.

Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, spent nearly a decade working in the Senate, including two as Young’s national security adviser. Before that, he was a Blackhawk pilot and served on active duty in the Army for 15 years. “If Congress does not exercise its constitutional war powers muscles, they atrophy,” Bowman said. “A president certainly has the prerogative to act in some instances in which there is an imminent threat to the United States. However, in most cases, there is time for Congress to ask tough questions and fulfill its Constitutional responsibilities. … If a potential military endeavor is prudent, the administration should welcome tough questions.”

-- Kaine was less diplomatic than Young when discussing Pompeo’s refusal to promise that Trump would seek congressional approval before going to war in Venezuela. “It drives me nuts,” he said during an interview. “I represent the most military state in the country. I have a child in the military. And I took the same oath that Pompeo and President Trump took, which was to support and defend the Constitution.”

The senator, who sits on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, is even more disturbed about this week’s saber rattling against Iran and last year’s decision to pull out of the 2015 nuclear accord. The senator said Trump is blundering the United States into a war with Tehran. Then he corrected himself. “I'd have to put ‘blundering’ in quotes because that makes it sound unintentional, and I'm not completely sure it's unintentional,” Kaine said. “I hope I'm wrong about this, but it well could be a mistake on the magnitude of the Iraq War if it leads into this set of provocations where we're backing away from growing diplomatic channels into bellicosity. … If you make diplomacy harder, you make war more likely.”

Kaine promised that he will do everything he can to stop an unnecessary war with Iran. “You take other things that I'm aware of that I can't tell you about because they're classified [and] I think the U.S. is in a position where we are basically a very strong actor poking a bees nest and when a bee comes out and stings us, this administration is going to say, ‘Oh, how dare Iran do that,'” he fretted. “I think this administration is trying to provoke Iran every way they can. And then if there is some military response of any kind, even an unplanned one by an Iranian-connected militia, then the Trump administration will basically say, 'How dare they do that!' and then they'll want to go in with overwhelming military force.”

-- Young has a different view of Iran than Kaine: He supports Trump’s containment strategy and sponsored a resolution this week commending the president for pulling out of the nuclear deal. “From the beginning, this deal enabled the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism to have relief from sanctions without dismantling their nuclear program,” Young said. “Despite Iran’s collapsing economy, the Iranian regime has also decided it would rather pursue nuclear weapons instead of selling their excess uranium and heavy water to help its own economy. We must stand firm on our maximum pressure campaign and never permit the Iranian regime to develop a nuclear weapon.”

-- Right after he finished his military service, Young spent 18 months as a legislative assistant for Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, who for decades was one of the country’s foremost voices on foreign policy. Being an L.A. is a junior role in a Senate office, but Young remembers it as his “dream job” and says he learned so much from watching the statesman work.

Young said he’s been reflecting on his mentor’s legacy since he passed away at 87 on April 28. The first-term senator said Lugar, who served six terms, was willing to make unpopular and difficult decisions when he believed they were in the best interests of the country. Although a supporter of Ronald Reagan, for example, Lugar led the Senate in overriding Reagan’s veto of legislation that imposed stiff economic sanctions on South Africa, which helped lead to the end of apartheid.

“He disagreed with the Reagan administration,” Young said, “and I think history's going to judge him very fondly for that position.”

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

A B-52H Stratofortress is seen through night vision coming in for a landing at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Thurday. (Staff Sgt. Ashley Gardner/U.S. Air Force/AP)

-- “B-52 bombers ordered by the White House to deploy to the Persian Gulf to counter unspecified threats from Iran have arrived at a major American air base in Qatar,” the AP reports. “Images released by the U.S. Air Force’s Central Command show B-52H Stratofortress bombers arriving at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Thursday night. Others landed at an undisclosed location Wednesday in ‘southwest Asia,’ the Air Force said.”

-- “This sense of an imminent Iranian threat marks a break from what U.S. officials had predicted just two weeks ago,” David Ignatius reports. “At that time, officials expected that Tehran would try to ride out Trump’s campaign of sanctions over the next 20 months, in the hope they would be removed by his successor. But last week, based on new information, the United States concluded that the Iranians had decided to reset their strategy now and were moving military equipment to prepare for action. It’s not clear whether this turnabout happened because U.S. sanctions were squeezing so hard that the Iranians couldn’t wait until January 2021, or because they concluded that Trump might be reelected. …

“U.S. officials have been particularly worried about a possible attack by Iranian proxies on the more than 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, who are training Iraqi military forces and otherwise bolstering security in the country. … The Iranian-backed militias were said to have been especially worried after U.S. helicopters dropped flares near Camp Speicher in Iraq, near Tikrit, where some of the Shiite militias are based. The flares ignited fields of crops near the base, and the militias apparently feared that this might be a prelude to military action.”

President Trump talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in 2017. (Andy Wong/AP)

-- The trade war escalates: American and Chinese negotiators failed to reach a deal by midnight, so Trump has officially more than doubled tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports. The two sides have agreed to resume negotiations today, but Beijing has also promised to respond with tit-for-tat tariffs. David J. Lynch and Damian Paletta report: “Robert E. Lighthizer, the chief U.S. trade negotiator, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ‘met with President Trump to discuss the ongoing trade negotiations with China. The Ambassador and Secretary then had a working dinner with Vice Premier Liu He, and agreed to continue discussions,’ the White House said in a statement.”

In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China “deeply regrets” Trump's decision and “will have to take necessary countermeasures.” This could involve state-backed boycotts of American products, tighter customs inspections and intensified tax audits of U.S. companies.

This could involve state-backed boycotts of American products, tighter customs inspections and intensified tax audits of U.S. companies. Because the higher tariffs apply only to goods that leave China starting Friday — not to shipments already approaching American shores — officials still have time to work out a last-minute solution.

Trump said yesterday that he received “a beautiful letter” from Chinese President Xi Jinping and may speak to him by phone. Trump said Xi’s message was: “Let’s work together. Let’s see if we can get something done.”

-- As the talks resume today, the United States and China must confront their biggest obstacle: their clashing understandings of the past. Lynch reports: “China’s history as the victim of what its officials call ‘unequal treaties’ from the 19th century makes Beijing reluctant to accept terms that might be seen at home as foreign dictates. Trump has tried to reassure China by stating publicly that his goal is not to prevent its rise and that he blames his American predecessors, rather than Beijing, for the chronic U.S. trade deficit … From the outset of the trade dispute, which centers on China’s technology-acquisition policies, Trump administration officials have been determined to avoid what they see as the mistakes of the past. Previous U.S. presidents from both parties entered into dialogues and agreements with China without permanently resolving issues of trade-secrets theft and forced technology transfer, the administration said.”

-- The FBI has expanded its investigation into whether GOP donor and South Florida massage parlor entrepreneur Li “Cindy” Yang illegally funneled money from China into Trump’s reelection campaign. The Miami Herald’s Jay Weaver, Nicholas Nehamas, Caitilin Ostroff and Sarah Blaskey report: “Investigators obtained a federal grand jury subpoena Tuesday seeking records from Bing Bing Peranio, an employee of Yang’s family’s spa business who last year contributed a maximum $5,400 to [Trump's] reelection effort ... Yang came to Peranio’s workplace and helped her write the check, Peranio told reporters from The New York Times ... Peranio told The Times she didn’t ‘say no.’ … FBI agents based in West Palm Beach are trying to determine if Yang reimbursed Peranio for that contribution or delivered ‘anything of value’ to her over that period to benefit the Trump campaign. Reimbursing someone for a political contribution without disclosing the original source is illegal, as is making a contribution in someone else’s name.”

-- The FCC blocked state-owned telecom giant China Mobile from operating in the United States and from offering phone services to American customers over concerns that Beijing is using the company as a vehicle to spy on U.S. communications networks. Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the firm raised a “significant risk,” an assessment commissioners from both parties agreed with. (Tony Romm)

The Alabama Senate tabled a bill that could become the most restrictive abortion law in the country. A shouting match broke out after the state’s Republican lieutenant governor used a voice vote to table an amendment that would make exceptions in the bill for cases of rape and incest.

THERE’S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- The GOP-led Senate Intelligence Committee’s decision to subpoena Donald Trump Jr. triggered an intraparty fight. Seung Min Kim and Karoun Demirjian report: “The sudden infighting threatened to undermine support for the Senate’s Russia investigation, which is the sole bipartisan probe in Congress into Russian interference in the 2016 election and has been widely praised as operating with little public drama. Much of the backlash against the decision by Chairman Richard Burr (N.C.) to subpoena [Trump’s] eldest son came from GOP senators who are up for reelection next year and from those closely aligned with the president. The outrage was partially fueled by Trump Jr. and his own allies. … Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a member of the intelligence panel, said the intense criticism of Burr was in part a misunderstanding of the focus of the committee’s investigation, which Rubio said is being inaccurately conflated with the special counsel probe.”

-- White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said it was “bad form” for Burr to subpoena Trump’s son without informing him.

-- The judge overseeing Roger Stone’s case ordered the Justice Department to give her access to unredacted portions of Bob Mueller's report. Politico’s Darren Samuelsohn reports: “U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson in a one-paragraph order gave the U.S. attorneys handling the Stone case until Monday to provide her with portions of Mueller’s report that deal with Stone ‘and/or “the dissemination of hacked materials”’ that were leaked during the 2016 presidential campaign to the detriment of Hillary Clinton. Jackson said she wants to review in private those blacked-out sections of the Mueller report as she weighs several motions from Stone’s lawyers requesting access as part of a larger bid to dismiss the case.”

-- Maria Butina, the Russian agent who cultivated close ties with the National Rifle Association to advance Moscow's interests, tells NPR the only thing she did wrong was failing to register as an agent of the Kremlin at the DOJ. In her first interview with an American outlet since pleading guilty, Butina said she was aware that Russian politician Alexander Torshin was sharing information she fed him with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and claims that she was not part of a Kremlin effort to influence the 2016 election. “Absolutely not … I don't know anything that was going on with the elections rather than the media reports,” she said.

-- Nancy Pelosi said she agrees with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler’s assessment that Trump’s stonewalling of congressional investigations presents a “constitutional crisis.” Felicia Sonmez reports: “Pelosi signaled Thursday that lawmakers may vote to hold more Trump administration officials in contempt. ‘In terms of timing, when we’re ready we’ll come to the floor,’ she said when asked about the timing of a vote by the full House on whether to hold [Attorney General Bill] Barr in contempt. ‘And we’ll just see because there may be some other contempt of Congress issues that we might want to deal with at the same time. And he wants to do it as soon as possible, and so do we.’”

-- A judge scheduled a hearing next week on Trump’s lawsuit to block his accounting firm from complying with a congressional subpoena, fast-tracking the dispute over the president's financial records. CNN’s Katelyn Polantz and Kate Sullivan report: “A hearing is now scheduled for May 14. Previously, the case was set up so that [Judge Amit] Mehta, a nominee of [Obama], would consider it in multiple stages, beginning next week — which could have lengthened out the legal fight and held off Congress from getting the records.”

-- The Trump team’s new strategy against House Democrats is essentially a dare to impeach the president. The New York Times’s Peter Baker, Maggie Haberman and Michael S. Schmidt report: “Confident that there are not enough votes to remove him from office through an impeachment trial in the Senate, Mr. Trump and his advisers have chosen the path of maximum resistance, calculating that they can put the Democrats on the defensive in a fight that is politically useful for the president. … ‘If it’s an impeachment proceeding, then somebody should call it that,’ said Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the president’s personal lawyers. ‘If you don’t call their bluff now, they’ll just keep slithering around for four, five, six months.’ … Democrats recognize what’s going on. ‘Trump is goading us to impeach him,’ [Pelosi] said at a Cornell University event in Manhattan this week. So far, they have neither taken the bait nor backed off.”

TARGETING POLITICAL RIVALS:

-- Rudy Giuliani is encouraging Ukraine to push for inquiries into sensitive U.S. political issues in the hopes that anything Kiev might find will benefit Trump. The Times’s Ken Vogel reports: “Mr. Giuliani said he plans to travel to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, in the coming days and wants to meet with the nation’s president-elect to urge him to pursue inquiries that allies of the White House contend could yield new information about two matters of intense interest to Mr. Trump. … ‘There’s nothing illegal about it,’ he said. ‘Somebody could say it’s improper. And this isn’t foreign policy — I’m asking them to do an investigation that they’re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I’m going to give them reasons why they shouldn’t stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.’”

-- Trump said former secretary of state John Kerry should be prosecuted for discussing the Iran nuclear deal with officials from that country after leaving office. Felicia Sonmez reports: “The president raised the issue during a freewheeling exchange with reporters after an event on health care at the White House. … Trump has long accused Kerry of holding ‘illegal’ meetings with Iranian officials and has argued that the former secretary of state violated the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from negotiating on behalf of the U.S. government without authorization. Thursday appears to be the first time Trump has publicly acknowledged that he asked members of his administration to examine whether they could prosecute Kerry.”

-- “Exactly whom Trump may have discussed this with would be of interest,” Aaron Blake notes. “Just last week, [Barr] struggled with a question from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) about whether Trump or the White House had requested any specific investigations. … And as we saw in the Mueller report, Trump hasn’t always been terribly careful about overstepping the boundaries between the presidency and the Justice Department when it comes to political allies and adversaries.”

-- Kerry spokesman Matt Summers emails that Trump should “focus on solving foreign-policy problems for America instead of attacking his predecessors for theater”: “Everything President Trump said today is simply wrong, end of story. He’s wrong about the facts, wrong about the law, and sadly he’s been wrong about how to use diplomacy to keep America safe.”

Kennedy Main Justice Department Building on Thursday. Rosenstein, who has worked for the federal government for more than 29 years, will be most remembered for overseeing Bob Mueller's investigation. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MEN:

-- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein bid adieu to DOJ in a ceremony dominated by allusions to the Mueller probe. Devlin Barrett reports: “Former White House counsel Donald McGahn was on hand for the ceremony, as was current White House lawyer Emmet Flood. Also in attendance were Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway and former attorney general Jeff Sessions. While [Jeff] Sessions and [Bill] Barr, sat on the stage with Rosenstein, former acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker, who also served with Rosenstein, stood in the back of the Justice Department’s Great Hall, largely unnoticed by the hundreds of current and former law enforcement officials there. … At one point Thursday, a video montage showed images of Rosenstein with his family, and his co-workers, to the theme music of ‘Band of Brothers,’ a miniseries about an Army company that suffered heavy casualties in World War II.’ ‘Things were often a bit not normal,’ Sessions said, to laughter from the audience.”

-- Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was disbarred. Keith L. Alexander and Rachel Weiner report: “The D.C. bar’s decision came after the court’s disciplinary committee issued a report in March that recommended Manafort be disbarred because of crimes 'involving moral turpitude.' In a four-page decision Thursday, the court ruled that because of Manafort’s convictions, 'the mandatory sanction imposed by statute is to disbar him from the practice of law.'”

-- “He founded ‘Students for Trump.’ Now he could face jail time for impersonating a lawyer,” by Politico Magazine’s Ben Schreckinger: “According to the federal government, at the same time he was building a nationwide political network and serving as one of the most visible young faces of Trump’s populist movement, [John] Lambert was also posing online as a high-powered New York lawyer, eventually making off with tens of thousands of dollars in fees he stole from unwitting clients seeking legal services. Lambert’s rise to prominence and recent indictment offer a cautionary tale of an ambitious young man caught up in Trump’s allure — a get-rich-quick fantasy of the American dream — who allegedly managed to create his own reality on the internet, only to have the real world come barging in.”

-- Trump nominated former Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan to permanently lead the Department of Defense. Missy Ryan and Paul Sonne report: “Shanahan has served as acting defense secretary since his predecessor, Jim Mattis, resigned late last year over policy differences with the president. Shanahan was recently cleared by the Defense Department inspector general of allegations that he was partial to his former employer while serving in the Pentagon’s No. 2 job under Mattis. Shanahan ‘has proven over the last several months that he is beyond qualified to lead the Department of Defense, and he will continue to do an excellent job,’ White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.”

-- Interior Secretary David Bernhardt is promoting oil and gas drilling despite resistance from Capitol Hill. Juliet Eilperin reports: “Bernhardt, who took office a month ago, said he was committed to carrying out Trump’s plans to expand fossil-fuel production on public lands. … Congressional Democrats have been pressing Bernhardt, who appeared before a House spending panel Tuesday and will testify before the House Natural Resources Committee next week, to factor climate change into the department’s decisions about energy development on public lands and in federal waters. But he emphasized that Interior was not legally obligated to curb the nation’s carbon output, even if it had to assess the environmental effects of its leasing programs. ‘The law requires us to analyze those things,’ he said, referring to the greenhouse gas emissions stemming from a leasing decision. ‘It doesn’t say if there is an additional contribution, you should not go forward at all.’”

-- Chris Christie has co-founded a property investment fund seeking to profit off a tax break for low-income areas known as opportunity zones included in the 2017 GOP tax overhaul. The Wall Street Journal’s Konrad Putzier reports: “Mr. Christie and his partners in the fund are hoping to raise about $150 million. … Although Mr. Christie’s name doesn’t appear in the fund’s brochure, people involved say he serves as a senior adviser. His wife, a former business development executive at the investment firm Angelo, Gordon & Co., is the fund’s executive vice president. … He joins a small but growing list of former government officials looking to cash in on the opportunity-zone program by raising funds and charging a fee to invest in the designated areas.”

WATCHING NORTH KOREA:

-- U.S. authorities seized a North Korean coal ship allegedly violating international sanctions just hours after Pyongyang launched a pair of short-range missiles. Devlin Barrett and Jeanne Whalen report: “Justice Department officials Thursday confirmed that the vessel, the Wise Honest, was approaching U.S. territorial waters in American Samoa, in coordination with the U.S. Marshals Service and the Coast Guard. … The 17,601-ton, single-hull bulk carrier ship is one of North Korea’s largest, and U.S. authorities said it was part of a network of North Korean vessels illicitly shipping coal from that country and bringing back heavy machinery in violation of U.N. and U.S. sanctions. … Separately on Thursday, U.S. military officials conducted a scheduled launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from an Air Force facility in California. … Trump told reporters Thursday that the U.S.-North Korea relationship ‘continues, but we’ll see what happens. I know they want to negotiate. They’re talking about negotiating, but I don’t think they’re ready to negotiate.’”

-- Trump and Kim fought their own subordinates while in the process of trying to achieve a historic disarmament deal. John Hudson and Josh Dawsey have a great tick tock: “In April, Kim demoted his point man for the nuclear talks, Kim Yong Chol, rebuking a prominent hard-liner and former spy chief who exasperated U.S. negotiators with his stubborn demands and aloof demeanor, two State Department officials said. Trump also has battled with his top advisers to preserve a positive atmosphere for a deal. On Tuesday, Trump told South Korea’s president in a phone call that he supports aid for North Korea to ease food shortages, despite the concerns of some U.S. officials that it might ease internal pressure on the regime.”

-- As part of nuclear negotiations before the February summit in Hanoi, Kim requested the United States send “famous basketball players” to North Korea. ABC News’s Tara Palmeri reports: “The request was made in writing, officials said, as part of the cultural exchange between the two countries, and at one point the North Koreans insisted that it be included in the joint statement on denuclearization. The North Koreans also made a request for the exchange of orchestras between the two countries. … Basketball diplomacy has been tossed around in the past as a way to breakdown roadblocks with Kim, who is a diehard basketball fan. Since boarding school in Switzerland, Kim has said he loves playing basketball and would wear a Chicago Bulls sweatshirt and Nike sneakers.”

-- North Korea’s latest missile tests showcase the country’s growing weaponry capability. Reuters’s Josh Smith reports: “North Korea’s second missile test on Thursday signals it is serious about developing new, short-range weapons that could be used early and effectively in any war with South Korea and the United States, analysts studying images of the latest launches say.”

AMERICA DIVIDED:

-- It was impossible to ignore the racial divide during the World Series champion Boston Red Sox’s visit to the White House yesterday. Several players, all of them Latino or African American, chose to skip the event. David Nakamura and Ashley Parker report: “Of the dozen players who [attended], only one — outfielder J.D. Martinez, who is of Cuban descent — is a minority. Manager Alex Cora, who is from Puerto Rico, also [skipped] the event. … The Red Sox have sought to play down the split, but the cleaving of the team along racial lines has symbolized an era in which Trump — who has sowed, and exploited, deep divisions in American society — has forced the nation to confront fundamental questions of identity, transforming what had once been feel-good ceremonies at the White House into pitched moments of cultural reckoning.”

-- The White House ceremony itself largely steered clear of politics. Toluse Olorunnipa and Cindy Boren report: “Under a light drizzle, Trump walked out onto the South Lawn of the White House flanked by Boston players Chris Sale and J.D. Martinez. … Trump didn’t reference the missing players, instead congratulating ‘all of the coaches and players of the Red Sox’ on their ‘incredible victory’ over the Los Angeles Dodgers last fall. … Other than congratulating himself for rebuilding the military, Trump didn’t veer into any of the thorny political topics that often capture his attention even during routine White House ceremonies.”

-- A retired U.S. Foreign Service officer was convicted of hate crimes after threatening Arab American Institute President James Zogby and other employees. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “W. Patrick Syring, 61, of Arlington, was found guilty by a federal jury in Washington, D.C., of threatening staffers based on their race and national origin … Syring, who served two tours in Beirut during his 25-year State Department career, pleaded guilty in 2008 to violating civil rights laws related to messages he left with AAI during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. ‘The only good Arab is a dead Arab,’ Syring said in a profanity-laden voice-mail message in July 2006, which he followed up with emails accusing Zogby of ‘promoting the interest of Hezbollah, Hamas and Arab terror’…After completing his sentence on his first conviction, Syring resumed his contacts with AAI employees, sending more than 700 emails from 2012 to 2017 containing nearly identical language and culminating in five death threats, prosecutors said.”

-- Classmates of Kendrick Castillo, the student killed during this week's school shooting in suburban Denver, stormed out of a vigil for him to protest what they called the politicization of his death. The students argued that two of the vigil’s speakers, Colorado Democrats Sen. Michael Bennet and Rep. Jason Crow, were using Castillo’s death to promote gun control. (Deanna Paul)

-- The school shooting suspects, identified as Alec McKinney and Devon Erickson, are expected to appear in court today. Corey Hutchins, Deanna Paul and Moriah Balingit report: “McKinney, who is under 18, is also set to learn whether he will be charged as an adult. One close neighbor whose child shared voice lessons with Erickson described the 18-year-old suspect as a young man from a nice family who was immersed in theater.”

-- Lawyers for the second suspect are asking that the court use the pronoun “he” when referring to their client. McKinney was assigned female at birth and now identifies as male. (Washington Examiner)

-- Police in Montgomery County, Md., say they're investigating a video of a white officer using the n-word. Jennifer Barrios and Dan Morse report: “During the roughly 12-minute body-cam video, which begins with the unidentified officer driving to the scene — a McDonald’s parking lot in the White Oak section of Silver Spring around 10:30 a.m. Thursday — the officer can be heard laughing and attempting to make light banter with the group of young African American men, who were lined up along the outside of the restaurant. Toward the end of the video, the officer says, 'Y’all n-----s been tryin’ to something.' Someone on the video can be heard calling her a 'racist,' and the officer indicates she was repeating something a person in the group had told her.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Anita Hill says that, in light of the #MeToo movement and Joe Biden’s presidential bid, it is understandable why his role in the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court hearings is being debated again. But now, she writes in an op-ed for the New York Times, it's time to talk about how to end sexual violence: “If the Senate Judiciary Committee, led then by Mr. Biden, had done its job and held a hearing that showed that its members understood the seriousness of sexual harassment and other forms of sexual violence, the cultural shift we saw in 2017 after #MeToo might have began in 1991 — with the support of the government. If the government had shown that it would treat survivors with dignity and listen to women, it could have had a ripple effect … Instead, far too many survivors kept their stories hidden for years. Thousands of women and many men have shared with me their stories of being sexually harassed since my testimony 28 years ago. These stories are especially troubling because they are so common. Yet they had long gone unseen, with the public viewing behavior from sexual extortion to sexual assault as a personal issue to be dealt with in private.”

-- Bernie Sanders’s memos to himself from his time as mayor of Burlington, Vt., in the mid-1980s depict a brutally honest man on the cusp of middle age, agonizing over the prospect of failure. Mother Jones’s Tim Murphy has an amazing story that will help you understand Bernie better: “Sanders did not keep a regular journal, and the mostly undated memos are scattered haphazardly amid his other work. But based on their contents, they were largely composed in the run-up to Sanders’ unsuccessful 1986 campaign for governor, at a pivotal juncture in his career. By early 1985, he had won three elections for mayor, and he had steered the city on a decidedly leftward course, taking on cable companies and developers and cultivating a national and international profile. But as Sanders considered his own future, he fretted over whether his time in Burlington would be a stepping stone or the end of the road.”

-- Health care, climate change and education are the three topics that Iowa voters bring up most often when Democratic presidential candidates take questions in the state. The Des Moines Register’s Brianne Pfannestiel reports: “Cable news staple topics, like Russia and presidential impeachment, rarely were brought up — just a couple of times. The questions also represent diverse concerns. Questions touched on nearly four dozen other topic areas. … In Muscatine, [Sanders] was asked about the need to address racial disparities in the U.S. health care system. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand was pressed in Ames about the best way to transition into an expansive new health care system without triggering a recession. And, in Clinton, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked about the rising suicide rate among farmers.”

-- With an eye toward 2020, House Democrats advanced a bill to protect people with preexisting conditions and bar the Trump administration from granting states waivers that would sabotage the Affordable Care Act. Mike DeBonis reports: “Next week, the House will vote on a package of seven health-care bills, several of which would reverse administration actions that Democrats have described as efforts to sabotage [the ACA]. The votes come as Trump recently renewed his vow to repeal the 2010 law and directed the Justice Department to support a lawsuit aimed at invalidating the law entirely — including its popular protections for Americans with preexisting medical conditions.”

-- Pete Buttigieg is the only top 2020 contender who is still not offering health care to his staffers. NBC News’s Josh Lederman reports: “Instead, Buttigieg is providing a monthly stipend to workers to buy insurance on their own through the Obamacare exchanges, his campaign said, with plans to offer health care in the future.”

-- Self-help author Marianne Williamson said she has qualified for the Democratic primary debates. Williamson’s campaign announced she has hit the 65,000-donor threshold laid out by the DNC. But she has not yet scored at least 1 percent in three qualifying polls, meaning she could still miss the debate stage if more than 20 candidates meet at least one of the requirements and the DNC is forced to use its tiebreakers to determine the participants. (Politico)

-- Andrew Yang, a relatively unknown presidential candidate, has been drawing big crowds and raising a surprising amount of money and has earned an expected spot on the Democratic debate stage. Holly Bailey profiles him: “A Taiwanese American entrepreneur, lawyer and philanthropist from New York who launched his long-shot bid for the presidency more than a year ago, Yang is barely a blip in most national polls, where his support ranks between 1 and 3 percent. But Yang has become something of a below-the-radar phenomenon in the crowded field of candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination.”

THE IMMIGRATION WARS:

-- Thousands of immigrants in cities along the U.S.-Mexico border are waiting for their asylum applications to be reviewed while they are exposed to haphazard conditions. The AP’s Elliot Spagat, Nomaan Merchant and Patricio Espinoza report: “The Associated Press visited eight cities along the U.S.-Mexico border and found 13,000 immigrants on waiting lists to get into the country … In some cities, days pass without anyone being processed, the AP found. In San Diego, up to 80 are handled each day, but the line in Tijuana, across the border, is the longest anywhere — about 4,800 people. Each day at each crossing, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials alert Mexican counterparts how many people they will take — a system that U.S. authorities call metering. Then the keeper of the list lets immigrants know who can go into the U.S. for asylum interviews. It is impossible to predict how many. Migrants pick their route based on a best guess of which city will offer the fastest crossing, and which will offer the safest stay in the meantime.”

-- The Department of Housing and Urban Development said more than 55,000 children — all of whom are legal U.S. residents or citizens — could be displaced under Trump’s plan to evict undocumented immigrants. Tracy Jan reports: “The proposed rule, published Friday in the Federal Register, would tighten regulations against undocumented immigrants accessing federally subsidized housing to ‘make certain our scarce public resources help those who are legally entitled to it,’ HUD Secretary Ben Carson said last month. But the agency’s analysis of the rule’s regulatory impact concluded that half of current residents living in households potentially facing eviction and homelessness are children who are legally qualified for aid. … Current rules bar undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing subsidies but allow families of mixed-immigration status as long as one person — a child born in the United States or a citizen spouse — is eligible. The subsidies are prorated to cover only eligible residents. The new rule, pushed by White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, would require every household member be of ‘eligible immigration status.’”

-- An ethics watchdog asked a federal agency to share any documents related to former White House chief of staff John Kelly and his newest employer, Caliburn International, which operates the nation’s largest shelter for unaccompanied migrant children. CBS News’s Graham Kates reports: “The nonpartisan organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) cited public reaction in its request for the documents. … ‘While in government, Kelly was directly involved in implementing the family separation policy, and he now works for a for-profit operator of child detention centers, Caliburn, that has reaped substantial financial benefits from that very policy, ‘ wrote CREW attorney Nikhel Sus.”

-- A new study found the number of college-educated Mexican immigrants in the U.S. has risen more than 150 percent in the past 19 years. NBC News’s Suzanne Gamboa reports: “Mexican immigrants with a bachelor’s degree rose from 269,000 in 2000 to 678,000 in 2017, an increase of 409,000, according to the report by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, and Southern Methodist University’s Mission Foods Texas-Mexico Center. That makes Mexicans the fourth largest group of college-educated immigrants in the country, after people from India, China and the Philippines, according to the study, which looked at highly skilled Mexicans in Texas and the rest of the nation.”

-- “Cindy McCain’s life without John,” by Roxanne Roberts: “Gone and yet not gone. The McCain legacy looms large, so much so that Republicans continue to praise his service and statesmanship even as [Trump] obsessively punches at his ghost. Before, Cindy was the elegant if aloof political spouse, standing on the side while her husband held the spotlight. Now she doesn’t have to worry about saying something that could damage her husband’s political career — and, despite the sadness of the past two years, she is a woman at ease with herself. … Cindy is now the keeper of John’s flame, a surrogate for her husband’s vision, values and principles for a fractured Republican Party.”

-- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban systematically undermined his country’s education system, but a Budapest university stood defiant — and it was founded by George Soros. The Atlantic’s Franklin Foer reports: “The university is widely considered the country’s most prestigious graduate school—it’s been a training ground for presidents, diplomats, and even members of Orbán’s own inner circle. But that inner circle had turned against the institution that had nurtured it and now sought to chase the school from the country’s borders. … Hungary once had some of the best universities in postcommunist Europe. But Orbán’s government has systematically crushed them. His functionaries have descended on public universities, controlling them tightly. Research funding, once determined by an independent body of academics, is now primarily dispensed by an Orbán loyalist. … The effort to evict CEU rattled liberals across the world. … The fate of the university was a test of whether liberalism had the tactical savvy and emotional fortitude to beat back its new ideological foe.”

-- Trump’s former ghostwriter, Charles Leerhsen, wrote an op-ed for Yahoo that details his experiences with the president while working on his book “Surviving at the Top” from 1988 to 1990: “What was it like for him to lose more than $1 billion in a decade? Was he perpetually ashen-faced with fear? Or smirking at the thought of outwitting the IRS ‘for sport,’ as he said in a Wednesday morning tweet? … Right in the middle of this period, I can tell you that the answer is that he was neither. Except for an occasional passing look of queasiness, or anger, when someone came into his Trump Tower office and whispered the daily win/loss numbers at his Atlantic City casinos, he seemed to be bored out of his mind. I tend to see my time with him — the first part of it, anyway, before things started going bad in a hurry — as his ‘King Midas’ period. I never said this to him; if I had, he probably would have thought I was suggesting he enter the muffler business. But there was a stretch of months when everything he touched turned into a deal.”

Like many in this group, he is a newly minted multimillionaire who became wealthy by working for high-profile San Francisco start-ups like Uber and Lyft, which are now about to go or have just gone public. Once their wealth was assured, these tech workers quit the companies and fled California, which has the nation’s highest state income tax, at more than 13 percent, to reside in lower-tax states like Texas and Florida, where there is no personal state income tax. … In fleeing California, these millennial millionaires are following a well-worn tradition. Over the years, many who made a fortune off Silicon Valley skedaddled to lower-tax locations where they could better protect their wealth.”

Now they’re lying to customers to avoid giving refunds. … TurboTax’s Free File product is created and run by the company. It is offered as part of a deal between the tax software industry and the government. The deal is specifically designed to keep the IRS from creating its own free online filing system.

HOT ON THE LEFT: “Delta told workers to save up for football, beer and video games instead of joining a union. It didn’t go well,” by Eli Rosenberg: “The posters included messages targeting the price of the dues that company workers would be paying if the union formed. ‘Union dues cost around $700 a year,’ one noted. ‘A new video game system with the latest hits sounds like fun. Put your money towards that instead of paying dues to the union.’ The other, with a picture of a football, was framed similarly. … In the charged world of social media, in which talk about socialism and the evils of unfettered capitalism percolates in the conversations of an invigorated left, the posters fell with a thud. ‘You know what sounds fun @Delta,’ Rick Smith, a liberal podcaster, tweeted. ‘Health care. A living wage. Dignity. Respect. A voice on the job. Safe working condition. Retirement security. $700 Is a great investment once you look at all you benefit from.’” HOT ON THE RIGHT: “Beto O’Rourke says Cory Booker's federal gun-license plan may go ‘too far,’” from Fox News’s Paul Steinhauser: “O’Rourke says that Booker’s new proposal to mandate the federal licensing of all gun owners goes too far. … ‘I don’t know that we need to take the additional step of licensing every single firearm to every single owner,’ [he said] … The former three-term congressman from El Paso — who’s a proponent of universal background checks for gun sales, an assault weapons ban, and so-called ‘red-flag’ laws to remove firearms from people who pose a danger to themselves or others — explained that ‘I come from, just like New Hampshire, a very proud gun-owning state. People who use firearms responsibly for hunting, for self-protection, for collection.’”

Opioid-related deaths increased by 8.2 percent in 2017 and by 70.4 percent in 2016, the report said. ... Statewide, Maryland is expected to spend $672 million on opioid-related initiatives this fiscal year, the report said — $242 million more than it will spend building schools. Next fiscal year, opioid-related spending will rise to $747 million. ... As recently as July, Maryland public health officials had labeled the surge in fentanyl deaths “staggering.” But annual fentanyl deaths did not increase as quickly in 2018 as they did previously — rising 17.1 percent last year, compared with a 42.5 percent spike the year before. 'We remain alarmed by the high toxicity, portability, difficulty of detection, low price, and wide availability of synthetic opioids,' the report said.

Chemung River finally gets second pair of nesting ospreys,"CLOSE Carole Talkowski, a master naturalist at Barefoot Beach in Florida, is astounded to see rare video of an osprey feeding at ground level. The bird usually feeds in higher nests and branches and stays clear of human activity. VPC

After erecting several nesting poles along the Chemung River to attract ospreys, Chemung River Friends reports that the fish-eating raptors have finally taken up residence at a second pole in the City of Elmira.

A pair of ospreys built a stick nest on a 30-foot-tall osprey nesting pole on the south end of an island in the river, adjacent to the Dunn Field baseball stadium on Elmira’s Southside, according to River Friend Executive Director Jim Pfiffer.

The birds have been there for at least a few weeks, with the female sitting on and incubating an unknown number of eggs, Pfiffer said.

The nesting pole near Dunn Field is one of four erected by River Friends with the help of other organizations and only the second to be occupied by ospreys.

“Ospreys are choosy in where they nest, because they spend their lives there,” Pfiffer said. “They want a location where there is plenty of fish, open space and free of human encroachment and development.

“Ospreys sit at the top of the food chain,” he said. “They eat the big fish that eat the little fish that eat the insects and so on. The ospreys nest here because there is a plentiful and healthy wildlife all the way down the food chain. That’s a sign of a healthy river.”

River Friends set up the first nesting pole in 2003 on Clinton Island in the middle of the river in downtown Elmira. That pole was finally occupied by nesting ospreys six years ago.

Related: Expensive weather-monitoring equipment stolen from Chemung River station

The Dunn Field nesting pole was erected in 2015. Pfiffer believes the new nesting pair is likely descended from the original pair.

River Friends and Eagle Scouts partnered to put osprey nesting poles at Bottcher’s Landing on the Chemung River in Big Flats and in the marsh near Wygant Road in Horseheads. Both of those sites remain vacant.

River Friends is also working with the Chemung County Federation of Sportsmen to install an osprey nesting pole near the Park Station Pond in Erin.

The appearance of a second pair of nesting ospreys along the river is a positive sign, said Bill Ostrander, president of the Chemung Valley Audubon Society.

“We have the basis for a solid growing population of ospreys in Elmira and Chemung County,” Ostrander said. “It’s a good sign that the river can support two families a short distance apart.""

Jury to decide life or death in murder case of Derrick Thompson,"PANAMA CITY - A jury will decide whether Derrick Thompson will get life without parole or the death penalty for the 2014 murder of Allen Johnson.

Thompson was found guilty Friday of 1st degree murder and robbery with a firearm for the killing of Johnson, a friend, to get money to finance an addiction to prescription pills. The penalty phase began Monday and continues Tuesday.

Witnesses were called by the prosecution and defense. Jordan Limmer, Johnson’s niece, cried when reading a statement about how her uncle was kind and generous, including helping with her horse riding hobby when she was young.

“It’s about what he still means to us and has done for all of us. Uncle Allen was present throughout all of my childhood,” said Limmer. “He made games for each kid because he knew we were all different but his to love. ... I won’t be able to call him anymore and tell him how thankful I am.”

Carolyn Thompson, Thompson’s mother, was called to the stand to talk about her son. Photos of Thompson from his childhood, service in the Army National Guard and with family were shown.

“It’s very close,” said Carolyn Thompson of her relationship with her son. “He had a normal childhood. ... He was president (of the FFA). He had a good relationship with his dad. They hunted and fished.”

Others who testified said Thompson is a religious man, didn’t have a disciplinary track record in prison. He took prescription medication after injuring his back, they said, and his personality changed in his addiction.

Monday's testimony also mentioned Thompson was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder in Santa Rosa County for the separate murders of Milton residents Steven Zackowski, 60, and Debra Zackowski, 59, shortly before Johnson was killed. Thompson was sentenced to life without parole in that case and those murders weren’t mentioned during the latest trial.

This is the first death penalty case to go to trial in Bay County since the revamping of capital punishment in Florida. The 12-person jury will now need to unanimously return a verdict in favor of the death penalty for the sentence to be imposed.",https://www.newsherald.com/news/20190506/jury-to-decide-life-or-death-in-murder-case-of-derrick-thompson?rssfeed=true,2019-05-06T18:20:00Z,Panama City News Herald,"501 W 11th St, Panama City, FL 32401, USA"
NRA President Says Rep. Lucy McBath Won Election Because She's 'A Minority Female',"The National Rifle Association’s new president, Carolyn Meadows, came at Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.) with some racist and sexist remarks in a recent interview, suggesting the congresswoman won her November election because she’s a black woman.

Meadows, who is from Georgia, told the Marietta Daily Journal that “we’ll get that seat back,” in reference to McBath’s congressional seat in the 6th District.

“But it is wrong to say like McBath said, that the reason she won was because of her anti-gun stance,” Meadows said in the interview, published Sunday. “That didn’t have anything to do with it ― it had to do with being a minority female.”

“And the Democrats really turned out,” she added. “And that’s the problem we have with conservatives — we don’t turn out as well.”

McBath, a political newcomer, defeated Republican incumbent Karen Handel in November in a major upset. (Handel had famously beaten heavily funded Democrat Jon Ossoff in a 2017 special election.) McBath won in the suburban Atlanta district ― long a Republican stronghold ― after campaigning on a bold gun control platform.

McBath, now 58, was a spokeswoman for gun safety group Moms Demand Action before running for office. She became an advocate for gun control after a white man complaining about loud music shot and killed her 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, at a Florida gas station in 2012.

In a series of tweets Monday, the lawmaker responded to the NRA:

“Hi NRA! It’s time we clear something up. I won this race because - after my son was senselessly murdered in 2012 - I stood up to do something about it,” McBath wrote, adding that her work on gun violence and other issues is “just starting.”

“And yes - as a woman of color I am proud to be part of the most diverse class in American history,” she added, referring to the 116th Congress, which included more women and people of color than ever before.

My work on gun violence, healthcare, and many other issues is just starting.



And yes - as a woman of color I am proud to be part of the most diverse class in American history.



My experiences drive the work I am doing for my constituents. And nobody can take that away from me. pic.twitter.com/LIC9ouiwRs — Lucy McBath (@lucymcbath) May 6, 2019

Meadows recently became the NRA’s president after the previous head of the gun lobbying group, Oliver North, stepped down last month amid a series of scandals rocking the organization. The NRA did not immediately reply to HuffPost’s request for comment.

McBath won her seat while touting gun reform in Georgia, a state with gun-friendly laws in the heart of the South, which has some of the nation’s highest rates of gun ownership.

She also benefited from voters turning out in November to vote for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost in an election marred by allegations of voter suppression.

Republicans Newt Gingrich and Tom Price previously represented McBath’s majority-Republican district, which has a highly educated and relatively affluent population that only narrowly went for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nra-president-lucy-mcbath-win_n_5cd07f21e4b0e4d75736af11,2019-05-06T16:13:45Z,HuffPost,"770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, USA"
"Club 322 closes: 'It's time to do a change,' owner says","Downtown Montgomery club known for drag shows was a force for gay rights; bar may reopen after 'high end' makeover

With drinks in hand, guests were all around the bar talking, playing darts and pool, and dancing under the huge disco ball for one last party.

The crowd was a mix of first-timers, regulars and old friends at Montgomery’s Club 322.

Some were gay, some straight. When Harlow “The Hit Man” Caldwell polled the crowd from the stage during the drag show, he got the biggest reaction by asking, “Where are my freaks at?”

Downtown said farewell to this landmark club Saturday night.

“It’s time to do a change,” said club owner Jerry Cook said Saturday. “Exactly what that change is, I’m not sure.”

Cook said it wasn’t an easy choice to close the club, which was known as much for gay rights activism as for fun times. But he said that the decision came “really fast.” The club’s social media is even going offline soon.

“It’s been crazy. It’s been up and down,” Cook said. “We’ve had a lot of good times, a lot of good things.”

But the bar may not be gone forever.

“We want to revamp,” Cook said. “We want to move forward with the times, so we’ll shut down for a while and get things cleaned up.”

Cook said the goal is to make 322’s facility into a higher end club. “With all the stuff going on downtown, with the Biscuits and everything, we want to move forward with it,” Cook said.

Cook can’t say for certain yet when, or even if, the club will return. “I’m not saying we’re going to reopen,” Cook said. “I’m just not saying that we’re not going to.”

The club has operated on North Lawrence Street since 2006, with drag shows on most Friday and Saturday nights. If or when they reopen, he said there are no thoughts of relocating to another area.

Among the guests partying Saturday was Danielle Powers, who has been going to Club 322 since she was a teenager - the club was open for ages 18 and up. Powers said 322 was a true part of the River Region’s LBGTQ community. “Jerry Cook is a really good man,” she said. “Some of the most upstanding people come from here.”

If there was a driving force behind 322’s origins, Cook said that it was the late drag queen Gayla DeLust, who died in 2014. A large portrait of her hangs in 322’s entrance. Cook said he met DeLust in 1983. “She worked with me at another business I owned,” Cook said. “She was just a good person. I’ve never known anybody to have anything negative to say about her.”

From 322’s beginning nearly 13 years ago, Cook said his bar has been a place for everybody. “You don’t have to worry about race, gender, sex or whatever,” he said. “They could just come do what they wanted. That was from day one.”

As a gay club set up in the heart of the South, Cook said they’ve faced surprisingly little backlash. He praised Montgomery's efforts with them. “The city has pretty much embraced us really well, and helped us,” he said. “They’ve helped to make sure we had a safe environment, that we didn’t have any problems here. The city’s been behind us a lot.”

It’s a club that’s stood at the forefront of local and statewide battles for gay rights. Cook’s proud of their work with drag queen and activist Ambrosia Starling against former Alabama Supreme Court Justice and political candidate Roy Moore over stances on gay marriage.

The club also stood up against hate. In 2016, they were part of national memorials to victims of the Pulse Nightclub shooting massacre in Orlando, Florida.

322 was a focal point for annual Montgomery Pride marches to the Alabama State Capitol steps, which this year takes place June 29-30. Cook said seeing the giant rainbow flag and being able to introduce Starling there were real highlights.

It's been a club full of celebration, including hosting a pageant for Miss Montgomery Pride on April 19. They also recently began hosting open stage talent nights on Thursdays.

The club has stood by local members of the LGBTQ community through hard times as well. In April, they held a memorial service for 322 family member Steven M. Seale, who died March 29, and raised funds for his expenses.

Cook, who also owns The Shack on Atlanta Highway, said he’s made lifelong friends through 322.

“I really appreciate all the support that we’ve had over the years,” Cook said. “We’ve had a lot of fun. We’ve had a lot of good parties.”

"Like it or not, the Electoral College is here to stay: your say","0504 Cartoon (Photo: Rick McKee, The Augusta Chronicle, GA)

Here to stay

I see a lot lately about abolishing the Electoral College but this would require a massive rewrite of article II of the Constitution in an amendment and I doubt you would ever get enough small states to go along.

The reality is the ""popular vote"" has absolutely no significance in the constitutional process of choosing a president. Voting at the citizen level is not even mentioned. It is only state law that gives you any vote at all because the Constitution simply says electors will be appointed by the state legislatures ""in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct"". They could have a lottery if they wanted to. I bet that would surprise a lot of people.

It sometimes amazes me how many people have never actually read the Constitution. On top of that there is really no guarantee that the electors will actually vote the way the legislature told them to. Some elections have ""rogue"" electors.

Since all of this requires that two-thirds of Congress would vote yes and the legislatures of 38 states ratify. None of the small states would, simply because it would effectively take them out of the process of electing a president.

Love it or hate it, the Electoral College is here to stay. In fact, it doesn't take a lot of imagination to see a circumstance when the left would want to have it if migration trends stay the way they are.

Since WWII, we’ve been the go-to country for support during crises. Our presence has prevented the wholesale takeover of countries by rogue nations and terror groups. We were the model to emulate.

Today, our reputation is at an all-time low. Dictators feel free to behave badly because Trump admires them. We no longer step in to help keep the world safer and saner. We haven’t always been right and some countries have a right to be angry with us, but we were still better than whatever was in second place.

Our president likes to be “unpredictable” and he behaves on impulse. Even when he stays with a position, it is destructive, such as his blind allegiance to a wall that will not solve the immigration issue.

When Donald Trump leaves, we will need a president who will help regain our credibility. Even if everything he or she does is welcome and healing, we will not be trusted for many years. The world will say, yes, they’re doing good things now, but that may only last until the next election. What is to stop them from again electing an incompetent, destructive fool with a mental problem? That is Trump’s legacy.

Lock thoughts

This morning, I am looking at 14 vessels waiting in line to go through the Chiquita lock. Why doesn't the lock master, or whomever has the keys to the kingdom, open the lock for 10 to 15 minutes and let the boaters pass through unimpeded?

I'm sure the canal system won't drain completely out in these short burst of common sense.

Education matters

In a recent Mailbag, a writer asked: Shouldn’t there be an age limit on paying school taxes? Shouldn’t there be a limit on what you are compelled to pay? Why aren’t the people who are causing the need for more schools be [sic] obliged to pay for them?

Well, John Adams wrote, “The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people and be willing to bear the expense of it.” Thomas Jefferson warned, “The tax which will be paid for this purpose is not more than the thousandth part of what will be paid to kings, priests and nobles who will rise up among us if we leave the people in ignorance.”

Certainly taxes collected and money paid out should fall under scrutiny, but careful scrutiny requires an educated electorate. If education is provided only to those who can afford it, we will create the very type of system from which we achieved our independence.

I wonder if people realize that each time they pick up a phone or goes somewhere for goods, services, medical attention, and virtually every other type of attention, they are interacting with products of our public education system.

Unnecessary encroachment

Yesterday evening, I had been looking forward to a repeat broadcast of Life, Liberty and Levin after missing it the first time. In fact, I had been waiting the whole week for that because so many people had told me how outstanding Mark Levin had been when it first aired. I was shocked to see that a second hour of coverage of the shooting in a California synagogue was underway.

Don't misunderstand me. The shooting, in which one person was killed, was horrible and could only have proceeded from a sick and evil mind. That is not the point, which is simply that all the facts about the shooting which were known or could have been known at that time could have been accurately stated in less than 10 minutes and Levin's fans, including myself, would not have been disappointed. Had additional important facts been uncovered that could have been reported at the bottom of the screen or during a quick short interruption.

This long, drawn-out, repetitive, uninformative and totally boring overcoverage was an unnecessary encroachment on viewers' time and patience.

Held accountable

As I watch TV and see all the immigrants trying to enter our country, men, women and children there are things they all have in common: most don't speak English, they are all very poor (the cartels got any money they may have had), most need medical attention, most are young and uneducated and the children are in bad shape.

Who do you think will pay for all the government services these illegal immigrants will require, billions and billions of our hard-earned taxes? Meanwhile, we have so many problems in this country where all that money could be spent.

I say let them make their application to enter and then return to Mexico until their case is heard. While all of this is going on, the socialist Democrats refuse to act, they are a disgrace and will be held accountable in the 2020 election.

See light

The best light by far is daylight. Sending our youngsters out before daylight is ludicrous. Folks can see much better driving in daylight than darkness. Even if we pay a fortune to light up the bus stops, the youngsters still have to get there alive.

If a politician or a school official tells you to send your youngster out before daylight, fire them. They are putting your youngster in harm's way so a few businesses can make an extra dollar serving patrons another hour in the evening.

A little artificial light or daylight, take your pick, its your choice.

Putting the honor in Honor Flight: Veterans greeted and feted to D.C. and back,"As a hospice patient with lung cancer and a grim prognosis from doctors, Philip Keenly wasn’t an ideal candidate to make the Collier-Lee Honor Flight trip to Washington, D.C., on Saturday.

The group’s volunteer medical staff debated whether to allow him on the trip or assign him to the less taxing Honor at Home ceremonies planned on the same day at Southwest Florida International Airport.

CLOSE Southwest Florida veterans participated Saturday, May 4, 2019, in the Collier-Lee Honor Flight from Fort Myers to Washington, D.C. Brent Batten, brent.batten@naplesnews.com; 239-263-4776

In the end, they decided with some special accommodations, Keenly could go.

His determination to see the monuments to him and his fellow veterans played into the decision.

“I’m a patriot and I feel very strongly about this country. I went through quite a goddam lot to be here. I’ve never seen it (the Korean War Veterans Memorial). I want to see that our story was told,” said Keenly, one of 86 veterans — the largest contingent in group history — who made the daylong trip on a charter plane to view the war memorials in the nation’s capital.

Eighty-six veterans, 86 stories.

Keenly enlisted in the Marines while still in high school, right after the Korean War broke out.

A rifleman, he took part in the battle at the Chosin Reservoir, notorious for the bitter cold the Marines endured.

“I couldn’t tell you how many guys came back with black feet,” Keenly said, describing the effects of frostbite.

Wounded with shrapnel, he was out of action for 10 days.

“It could have been a helluva lot worse,” he said.

Stories like that of Bob Naum, a B-17 navigator based in England who flew 29 missions over western Europe during World War II. When not plotting a course with a sextant, pencil and paper, he manned a gun fending off German fighters. “I don’t think I ever knocked one down, but I shot a lot of shells at them,” Naum said.

He spent his 96th birthday Saturday in fine style, dancing to big band music and receiving kisses from Andrews Sisters lookalikes near the World War II Memorial.

All his squadron mates are gone, Naum said. “There must be something else someone wants me to do,” he said explaining his longevity.

“It was fantastic,” Naum said near the end of the 20-hour trip.

Or that of James Flanagan, 95. A Marine, Flanagan was learning to fly a dive bomber in preparation for the invasion of Japan when the war ended with the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “President Truman was nice enough to end the war,” Flanagan said.

He’s been to the World War II Memorial before, but never with a group of fellow veterans. “It brings it home now, more than then,” Flanagan said. “You realize what the service people did.”

There was Norma Jock, one of two female veterans on the trip and a Navy recruiter in New York City during the Vietnam War. She never served in Vietnam but being a recruiter in that era carried its own dangers, she recalled. “They blew up (a recruiting station) in the Bronx. They blew up one in Times Square,” she said.

And Joseph Lipps, who served with the Army’s 34th Engineers at the height of the Vietnam War.

Nearly blind, an impairment Lipps attributes to exposure to Agent Orange, although the government hasn’t acknowledged that, Lipps carried with him the names of 25 fallen comrades.

Honor Flight volunteers made pencil etchings of the names from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall and gave them to Lipps, so he can look at them up close under better light at home.

“I wasn’t expecting that,” Lipps said.

There were somber moments on the trip, to be sure. “It’s an emotional roller coaster,” said Rafael Lopez, one of the organizers.

“If you don’t well up with emotion on that sort of thing, you never will,” said Naples resident and Korean War era veteran Ray Nugent, leaving the changing of the guard ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery.

But mostly, the mood was festive.

Arriving at Reagan National Airport the veterans and the volunteer guardians accompanying them were greeted by the 32-piece Falls Church, Va., concert band and well-wishers, some volunteers with Honor Flight in Washington, D.C., some simply travelers who walked over from their gates to shake a veteran’s hand and say, “Thank you.”

“That was a wonderful reception. I was in tears. It was just overwhelming, said Army veteran Theodore Cadieu. Although never in combat, some considered Cadieu the most important man in his unit. He was in charge of making sure everyone got paid.

He summed up what many feel about their military service.

“I got a life-changing experience from it. It instilled discipline in me, responsibility. It showed me I can be useful,” he said.

Throughout the day, spontaneous corridors of park visitors would form to thank the Honor Flight group as it made its way around the monuments.

Arriving back at Southwest Florida International, there was an even bigger welcome awaiting veterans.

Organizers estimate 3,000 people, the largest welcoming committee in the group’s six-year history, lined the terminal to shake hands and thank the veterans for their service. There were bands, JROTC units, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, veterans’ groups, costumed military personnel from different eras, flag-waving families and people with no affiliation other than to just thank a veteran.

“Don’t you dare write that I cried,” Nugent said making his way through the phalanx of greeters.

The number of World War II and Korean War veterans is dwindling. “History is leaving us quickly,” Honor Flight media coordinator Rick Wobbe said.

This trip, the local group’s 19th, included 15 veterans from World War II and 34 from Korea.

As the trend continues, the group will bring in Vietnam and Cold War era veterans take their place.

Chartering a plane costs about $130,000, gathered through donations. Storm Smart Shutters contributed $80,000 toward Mission 19.

The next trip is planned in September.

Retired NFL star Deion Sanders' long-awaited return to Fort Myers leads to reconciliation,"CLOSE Deion Sanders, a North Fort Myers High School graduate, shares portions of his life story with the community on Saturday at Fort Myers High School. Kinfay Moroti, The News-Press USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA

Deion Sanders' return to Fort Myers on Saturday was an effort at reconciliation with his hometown.

The two-time Super Bowl winner and World Series player was awarded a key to the city during a community forum Saturday night at Fort Myers High School.

The relationship between Sanders, 51, and the city he grew up in has been a rocky one. It included failed business proposals such as a 2005 attempt to build affordable housing where it's needed the most and an arrest for trespassing and fishing on a private lake near Southwest Florida International Airport.

But on Saturday night, all of that appeared to be forgotten as Sanders was welcomed on stage with a standing ovation with audience members cheering loudly for him.

""You are indeed a hometown hero,"" said Fort Myers Mayor Randy Henderson.

The event was attended by about 150 people, and their recognition of Sanders prompted the Pro Football Hall of Fame member, known as ""Prime Time,"" to apologize to his childhood city.

""This is long overdue. This is like a reconciliation for me,"" Sanders said. ""The reason it hurt so bad was because I don't give a damn what they say about me in Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, New York,"" Sanders said. ""I don't care because it was my job. ... When you talk about me, some things I let slide, but you are all family. You only get one shot at calling the place home.""

""Thank you from the bottom of my heart,"" Sanders said. ""God was saying reconciliation. This has been reconciliation and a spirit of peace since I got here.""

""I apologize to you as well. You have no idea what you all did to me this particular weekend. The best is yet to come.""

For his return, Sanders brought with him Dallas-area Pastor Omar Jahwar to hold Prime's Community Correction, a forum meant to understand the problems that Fort Myers faces. On Sunday, Sanders was set to host his Prime Elite Underclassmen Camp for local athletes at Bishop Verot High School.

The Saturday night talk was a fact-finding mission but included few details on how to help the city. Sanders promised to return.

Violence, poverty and lack of opportunity are some of the factors that lead to violence in a community, Jahwar said.

""Social civility is available to young people even when they don't understand it,"" Jahwar said. ""Violence becomes the language of those who are underserved.""

Jahwar mentored Antong Lucky, founder and former leader of the Dallas 415 Bloods gang, and the two are now part of Urban Specialists, a group that looks to use the experience of former gang members as the best way to keep others from that life.

""The key thing for us to do, especially people who are trying to help, is to listen,"" Lucky said. ""You've got to hear what people want without judging them.""

Lucky said violence, drug dealing and gangs become part of the equation because of proximity. It's what they see in their community, Lucky said, and it's a cycle that continues.

However, Sanders didn't get caught up in it. Sanders grew up in Dunbar but at an early age said he would stay away from drugs and alcohol to remain focused on sports and school.

""I am only up here right now because I had a plan,"" Sanders said. ""I did not allow anyone out there to affect my plan.""

Sanders was almost brought to tears when he spoke about his mom, Connie Knight, and the long work hours she put in at Lee Memorial Hospital.

Sanders also thanked her for exposing him to life outside his neighborhood. He said she would take the North Fort Myers High School graduate for drives down McGregor Boulevard and to Naples. The exposure to a different life showed him what was possible.

""I was exposed to so much that I had a choice so I didn’t fall prey,"" he said. ""I had seen another way. That influence changed my life.""

Henderson said Sanders' ""message quite frankly was one of the most powerful messages I have witnessed in my adult life.""

His apology was an ""outward demonstration"" of his character.

""I'm not sure that was necessary, but he felt that was necessary and that's what I respect and I honor that,"" Henderson said.

Lehigh High School football coach James Chaney, who played with Sanders at North Fort Myers and Florida State University, said it was good for his team to hear Sanders talk about his accomplishments.

Chaney said he was grateful for Sanders' return and the past should remain in the past.

But he said it's important to remember there are men in Dunbar and Fort Myers who are working to make change for others.

""I don't ever want to discount what the average man has done for our kids,"" Chaney said. ""You don't have to be a NFL player to give back, and I feel (Sanders) feels that, too.""

Earnest Graham, football coach at Evangelical Christian School and a former NFL player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said Sanders appears to be ""a man of purpose"" and will get things done.

Fort Myers Councilwoman Terolyn Watson is hoping the city and Sanders can move forward and facilitate changes that are needed.

""I think Deion's main message tonight is the choices you make in life can make a difference,"" Watson said. ""He's one of our most successful people. He has a great story. He's a great role model.""

Darrell Rowe, 14, was excited to see Sanders in person. He plays football and basketball and participates in track.

""He's someone I can look up to, someone who made it out,"" the Oak Hammock Middle School student said. ""I can do the same thing and I can make it out.""

PV dedicates Chris Hixon Fitness Center,"Pleasant Valley High School honored an alumnus and hero at the dedication of the Chris Hixon Fitness Center on Monday evening.

Hixon, an athletic director and coach at Parkland, Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, lost his life during the school shooting on February 14, 2018 as he protected his students from the shooter.

High school Principal Matt Triolo served as master of ceremonies at the dedication, painting a heartfelt and caring portrait of a man who gave all for his students, even his life.

“When Chris heard the gunshots, he got into his golf cart and drove to the school and entered and found the shooter,” Triolo said. “He saved as many students as he possibly could before the shooter moved on. When the police arrived to where Chris was, after being shot multiple times he was standing against the wall, and still had a radio in his hand. He was going to protect his students until he absolutely could not protect them anymore.”

Triolo spoke highly of Hixon as a man who dedicated himself to his students and athletes, even volunteering to coach five sports programs at Marjory Stoneman Douglas for no pay. Truly, Triolo said, Hixon represented the very definition of a hero.

“My mother always asks me at least once a year, ‘What would you do? What would you do if there was a school shooter that came into your building?’” Triolo said. “Like any good son, I say, ‘Mom, don’t worry about it, everything’s going to be fine.’ But I can honestly say that after the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, what I say to my mom, what I say to anybody is, ‘I hope I can be as brave as Chris Hixon.’”

A PV graduate from the class of 1986, Hixon was involved in football, wrestling, track and the National Honor Society. He joined the Navy shortly after graduation, and served in the Persian Gulf War. Hixon proceeded to move to Florida, where he worked as an athletic director at several schools, including Marjory Stoneman Douglas, for over 20 years.

The idea for the dedication came from former PV Middle School Principal Rocco Seiler and current teacher Laura Anglemyer, both classmates of Hixon at Pleasant Valley. Triolo also thanked athletics and activities secretary Lorrie Anderson, athletics and activities director Jake Percey, assistant athletics and activities director Greg Bowman and the maintenance staff for their help with the project.

Among the crowd was Hixon’s family, including his mother Toni, his father Russell and his brother Richard, along with Chris’s fellow classmates from Pleasant Valley’s class of 1986. Chris’s widow Debbie was unable to attend, as she was helping to distribute scholarship’s in her late husband’s name to seniors at three high schools in Broward County, Florida.

Anglemyer said that Hixon was always upbeat and positive, and driven to help others through his Navy service and his work as an educator.

“We can only imagine what Chris would think, having this fitness center named after him, but I’m sure he would be proud,” she said. “Chris’s legacy will continue here at PV, where it all began, and hopefully it will inspire others to give back, as Chris did.”

When Richard Hixon took to the podium, he reflected on writing his speech, explaining that his idea stemmed from watching his daughter’s soccer practice and an encounter with the principal of Marjory Stoneman Douglas. As he toured the high school building in Florida, the principal pointed out the weight room, remarking that it was designed and built by Chris. That led to Hixon pondering the notion of weight rooms – the place where the work is done, where skills are honed for one incredible moment, whether on the field or off.

“It’s a place where kids with god-given talent maybe don’t go to, but some of us have to,” he said. “It’s a place where kids talk, start learning. It takes hard work and prayer for the one time you have to do something extraordinary. It’s exactly what Chris did every single day. Chris did an extraordinary act on that day, and it showed exactly what Chris really is. So I think the perfect place to have Chris remembered is a PV weight room.”

Toni Hixon was invited to cut the ribbon for the grand opening, an experience she described as stirring but heartbreaking.

“It was just really heart-wrenching for me,” she said. “They let me cut the ribbon to enter the room, and then I broke down, you know. I said, ‘Christopher, this is for you.’ Everybody had a chance to go in the room, and there’s so much equipment in that room that I can’t believe it. They have every kind of exercise equipment you can imagine.”

Hixon said she was moved by the number of friends and classmates who spoke so highly of Chris, and proud that her son was able to make a difference in so many people’s lives.

“There were some people who went to school with Christopher, and some that just knew him, and they all said he was such a nice guy,” she said. “I said, ‘Well, I hope I raised a nice guy,’ and apparently I did, since there have been so many accolades about him.”

Triolo closed the ceremony by calling attention to the district mantra of “PV Pride,” and how Hixon was the very embodiment of that concept, from his years at Pleasant Valley to his untimely but heroic end.

“Nothing gives us more pride than to think of a man who once walked these halls giving his life for the same reason we go to work every day,” Triolo said. “Chris’s memory will always represent courage, hard work, no quit, pride, compassion and care. Chris didn’t just give his life for his students, he lived his life for them, and as well as through athletics. It’s only fitting that we’ll remember him here at Pleasant Valley forever by dedicating this fitness center after him.”",https://www.poconorecord.com/news/20190505/pv-dedicates-chris-hixon-fitness-center?rssfeed=true,2019-05-05T06:20:00Z,poconorecord.com,"511 Lenox St, Stroudsburg, PA 18360, USA"
"After 90 years, greyhound racing comes to an end in Sarasota","Florida voters decided to abolish live greyhound racing by the end of 2020. The Sarasota Kennel Club is stopping a year early.

SARASOTA — Airplanes will still rumble overhead as they take off at Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport. Cars and trucks will still whoosh by. The buses will still groan as they stop in front of the Sarasota Kennel Club.

But after this weekend, the sounds along Bradenton Road and University Parkway will never be the same.

That’s because the dogs are going away.

That means no more crescendo of barks as the lean greyhounds are led from the kennel to the track.

That means no more bugle call.

“Swifty,” the mechanical rabbit that leads the dogs to the finish line, will be gone, too. So will the sound of those guys leaning against the wire fence — the guys who yell, “Come on four, get back on it. Get in there four.”

Perhaps that’s what led Jean McCormick and thousands of others to the Sarasota Kennel Club on Saturday. It was a chance to place one last bet and take in the end of a Sarasota tradition since 1929.

Saturday was like the old days, McCormick said with a smile, back when she fell in love with Dan, who later became her husband. Back before the lottery, when the ladies wore peacock hats and lined the fence, hands clutching betting slips or beer cans or both.

McCormick worked the concession stand for 23 years. She loved the characters. The heavy-betters, the rugged greyhound trainers, even the unique personality of each dog.

Before the first race kicked off at 12:30 p.m., McCormick sat at the table closest to the kennels. She wanted to watch them as they pulled the gangly teenage handlers to the track, “hungry for a run.”

The memories, she said, were too powerful to describe.

She hadn’t been back since Dan died in 2006. She left soon after, moving to Port Charlotte.

“I think the heart of this today are the people that made this place special,” said McCormick, nodding toward a tall man flanked by TV cameras near the track.

That’s Tom Bowersox, 74, he’s director of racing operations. He’s been here a long time.

In front of the cameras, he talked about the decision voters made in November that put racing in Florida on its last legs.

He talked about the Collins family, who have operated the track since 1944, and their decision to end things before the 2020 deadline.

Later, in his office, Bowersox, who has worked for the Collins family for 58 years, doing “every job you can imagine,” talked about the layoffs. Hundreds of layoffs. Bowersox thinks he’ll stick around for a little while longer.

It’s hard to say how many at the Sarasota Kennel Club at this point, he said.

“Just know that for many of us, it’s the only job we’ve ever known,” Bowersox said.

The industry has operated in the state for almost a century but has dwindled to 11 tracks. Outside of Florida, just six greyhound tracks in five U.S. states remain.

Experts in the industry anticipate 3,000 lost jobs statewide, 5,000 to 8,000 greyhounds who need homes and $11 million in lost revenue to the state once racing ends.

After this weekend, the club plans on expanding its popular poker room, possibly moving to a more central location in Sarasota County, and hopes to add sports gambling, should it become legal in Florida.

Many of the dogs have already been shipped to tracks and kennels in the Panhandle.

“If you want to know the heart and the people most affected by this change,” Bowersox said, ""you need to talk to Deb.”

Everybody from Sarasota to Ebro, a small town outside of Panama City, knows Deb Linn. It’s the bright, goldfish-colored shirts she wears. It’s the baseball caps she sports to keep her blonde hair out of her eyes. It’s the Wisconsin accent she can’t seem to shake.

Shortly after high school, the 50-year-old owner of De-N-De, a kennel business, fell in love with greyhound racing. It was the dogs.

She loved it so much that 28 years ago, she wrestled the money to start her own business. For Linn, it’s not a job. It’s a lifestyle. No health care, pension or retirement plan. All she makes goes into the dogs.

But that’s about to change.

Linn has to junk or donate everything. The trailers, the kennels, the medicine. The dogs, which she helped train since they were 14 months old, will have to go, too.

“I haven’t cried yet because I’ve been way too busy preparing for the end,” Linn said. “I think the day it will hit me is the day I wake up to the sound of silence. No barking, no playing, no goofy greyhound stuff.”

The Collins family had no plans Saturday to address the more than 7,000 spectators after the final race. There would be no commencement or big send-off, said Chris Collins, 53, the grandson of Jerry Collins, the man who took the track over in 1944.

The family would relax and let every one soak in the finish.

“But for me, the eerie thing will be coming out here on a Friday night, and hearing nothing but silence,” Collins said. “It’s going to be quiet.”",https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20190504/after-90-years-greyhound-racing-comes-to-end-in-sarasota?rssfeed=true,2019-05-04T18:44:14Z,Sarasota Herald,"1777 Main St, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA"

Fatal motorcycle crash closes I-275 SB for hours,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) –

Interstate 275 was closed southbound for hours following a fatal motorcycle crash Friday night.

The crash occurred near mile marker 23, near the 5th Avenue North exit.

The Florida Highway Patrol reports a 27-year-old man was attempting to pass two vehicles near mile marker 23 and lost control of his motorcycle and collided with the first vehicle.

The motorcyclist was then overrun by the second vehicle. The motorcyclist was taken to Bayfront Hospital as a trauma alert where he later died from his injuries.

Videos show deputies in action in Monroe County,"<p>On a Sunday evening in March, Monroe County Sheriff's Office deputies rushed to a house in Key Largo after receiving a 911 call about a medical emergency there.</p>

<p>By time deputies arrived, they heard a man yelling for help. The woman inside ""had no pulse, was not breathing, and her face was blue,"" deputies reported.</p>

<p>""She had a pulse... she's going back down,"" one deputy said on body camera video.</p>

<p>After performing CPR and placing automated external defibrillator (AED) pads on the woman, both deputies on scene administered Narcan, the medication used to reverse opioid overdose.</p>

<p>In minutes, the woman regained a heartbeat and began breathing on her own.</p>

<p>That night was one of many that sticks with Deputy Ignacio Molina, one of the deputies who helped save her life.</p>

<p>Molina, deployed five times with the Marines and now working in the Sheriff's Office Upper Keys unit, said calls in the Keys range from drug and alcohol related crimes, crashes, property crimes, to the occasional violent incident.</p>

<p>""Drunk driving is a big, big thing here,"" Molina said.</p>

<p>On a night a Local 10 crew rode with Molina, during his 6p.m. to 6a.m. shift, Molina pulled over a car speeding on the Overseas Highway. He said he smelled marijuana in the car and asked to search the driver's bag, where he found suspected joints.</p>

<p>""There it is - positive for marijuana,"" Molina said after performing a field test on the substance.</p>

<p>He let the driver go with a notice to appear.</p>

<p>In the course of the night, Molina also pulled over a swerving car, which ended up being full of lost tourists. He pulled over a man on a golf cart illegally driving on the pedestrian path along U.S. 1, who had a suspended license and a warrant, according to records.</p>

<p>He also deftly dealt with a tourist at a swanky resort, suspected of being unruly and drunk. Molina convinced him to go back to his room and order food.</p>

<p>And around midnight, he stopped a man on a bicycle with a chainsaw that was suspected to be stolen property. But saving lives, like on that night in March, is one of a law enforcement officer's most important jobs.</p>

<p>Deputies in the Keys have been carrying Narcan for the last two years, according to a department spokesman. School Resource Officers now carry the potent drug as well.</p>

<p>""It feels good. It gives you a sense of:  'this is why I do the job.'"" Molina said.</p>

Men go from catcalling to attacking 2 women in Miami's Wynwood,"<p>After a group of men who were accosting her and her partner brutally attacked them in Miami's Wynwood, Jessica Saravia said she is afraid. She wants the men arrested.</p>

<p>Saravia and Susana Duron said they were walking in the neighborhood's popular area of Second Avenue at 24th Street when a group of men started to harass them. They had picked up some pizza, so after cat-calling, one asked for a slice. </p>

<p>""The moment I spoke up, he struck me,"" Saravia said, adding that she had never seen the man before. ""He split my lip. I got 7 to 10 stitches from the inside out. I'm missing teeth on top and I have loose teeth on the bottom."" </p>

<p>The men struck Saravia several times in the head. She suffered a mild concussion. Duron punched one of them, and he pushed her to the ground. Although her head hit concrete, she wasn't injured. A man who was part of the group tried to stop the attackers but it was too late. </p>

<p>Saravia called 911, and the guys started to scatter and drove away. She tried to take a picture of one of their license plates, but one of the guys blocked her. They reported them to the Miami Police Department and detectives are searching for the attackers.</p>

<p>Duron and Saravia said they want the brazen attackers caught.

TAIWAN (KRON) - Who knew Apple products had such... resiliency?

A Taiwanese man was surprised to learn one of the Apple AirPods he accidentally swallowed still worked, even after he had to pass the device through his system, and salvage it from the toilet.

Ben Hsu reportedly fell asleep with the Airpods in his ears and woke up realizing his right Airpod was missing.

Using the tracking feature on the device to locate it, he heard a beeping sound coming from his stomach, the publication reports.

Hsu then went to the hospital where an x-ray confirmed the missing AirPod was located in his stomach.

The doctor gave Hsu some laxatives and two days later, he passed the AirPod through his digestive system and was reunited with the missing earpiece!

He even filmed a video of himself, digging through his own waste, to show you that it all really did happen.

Hsu told local media he washed the AirPod and it functioned properly.

""'The battery was still at 41 percent! It was incredible,' he told The Daily Mail.

If Hsu had not successfully passed the AirPod through his system, plan B would have been surgery.

Horror film to feature man-eating alligators as fictional Category 5 storm strikes Florida,"- Filmmakers combined a bevvy of those ""only in Florida"" moments that Floridians know all too well to make an over-the-top horror movie set to be released in theaters this summer.

""Crawl"" is about a Category 5 hurricane that hits Florida, where alligators then attack residents who didn't evacuate ahead of the fictional storm.

The movie trailer, which was released on Wednesday, begins with the governor warning residents to leave because rescuers won't be able to save them.

They were here first. Check out the official poster for #CrawlMovie, in theatres July 12. pic.twitter.com/va4MTXkZzK — Crawl Movie (@TheCrawlMovie) May 2, 2019

It then cuts to a woman who ignores the evacuation order in order to search for her father. She then becomes trapped in the flooding house as the hurricane hits.

While the storm rages outside, the woman then must battle hungry alligators that make their way into the home.

A poster for the movie features a sign warning about alligators, which reads: ""Danger! Alligators are common in this area. They can be dangerous. They are known to stalk their prey. They will hunt you.""

""Crawl"" is scheduled to be released in theaters July 12.

Man accused of defrauding clients from around the world seeking pregnancy surrogates,"COLLEGE PARK, Md. - A Florida man faces charges in Maryland that he defrauded clients of a company that offered to help locate and financially support pregnancy surrogates for people trying to become parents.

Federal prosecutors say 37-year-old Gregory Ray Blosser was arrested Monday in Florida on a wire fraud charge and detained pending a Friday hearing in Miami.

Blosser has operated The Surrogacy Group since 2012, with offices in Annapolis, Maryland, and Tampa, Florida.

Clients paid Blosser tens of thousands of dollars to find surrogates and support them during pregnancies. A criminal complaint says Blosser either failed to locate suitable surrogates or pay for their fees or expenses after clients deposited into escrow accounts.

An FBI agent's affidavit says Blosser's victims include clients from Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Australia and Germany

SMITHFIELD, N.C. (AP) — A Florida man has been arrested in one of North Carolina’s coldest cases: the 1972 slaying of a woman found bound and shot beside her 4-month-old baby.

The News & Observer reports 65-year-old Larry Joe Scott was arrested Monday in Bradenton and charged with murder and kidnapping in the death of 33-year-old Bonnie Neighbors.

Neighbors was kidnapped with her baby boy while on her way to pick up her 7-year-old son from school. Her body, and the living infant, were later found in a migrant worker house near Benson.

Johnston County Sheriff Steve Bizzell says the investigation picked up after nearly 47 years when newer DNA technology pointed to Scott. State Attorney General Josh Stein says confirmatory testing is in process.

"Man faces DUI manslaughter charge in crash that split car, killed girl","ALTAMONTE SPRINGS, Fla. - A 40-year-old man was arrested on DUI manslaughter charges in connection with a Seminole County crash that split a car in half and killed a girl, police said Friday.

The girl was pronounced dead at the scene. The boy was taken to a hospital.

According to police, an investigation revealed that speed was a factor in the crash, and toxicology reports revealed Mora was under the influence of alcohol.

"Florida man accused of stealing cruiser, leads to chase on turnpike","OKEECHOBEE COUNTY, Fla. - A 22-year-old Largo man is accused of stealing a cruiser and leading Florida troopers on a chase.

The Florida Highway Patrol said Shane Jensen has been charged with stealing a patrol car and reckless driving.

Investigators said around 4 p.m. a trooper saw Jensen who appeared to be medically distressed, along the Florida Turnpike in Okeechobee County.

This was on the northbound shoulder at the 181st mile marker.

Troopers said Jensen was sitting on the grass shoulder next to the trooper's cruiser.

When the trooper went to get Jensen water, he got up and stole the cruiser, according to FHP.

Highway patrol said the suspect reversed the cruiser and accelerated toward three troopers in an attempt to run them over.

Investigators said Jensen drove into Osceola County.

Troopers responded by deploying stop sticks, according to investigators.

Jensen avoided the sticks and drove on the grass median and stopped against a guardrail, according to highway patrol.

Troopers said he exited the vehicle and ran into the woods.

He was arrested and transported to a local hospital for treatment.

No troopers or civilians were injured in the incident, according to highway patrol.

Help 'Stamp Out Hunger' on Saturday,"Donations made locally through the nation's largest single-day food drive will remain in Marion County.

Got an extra can of beans, or some peanut butter and jelly? Someone else could use it. Actually, lots of others could use a bag of groceries.

Single moms trying to feed their children. Someone who lost a job and is now homeless. A man or woman who is simply down on their luck. These are all examples of people who visit area help agencies, food banks and soup kitchens on a daily basis.

On Saturday, area residents can help the needy in Marion County by placing bags of non-perishable food items on mailboxes for collection by local letter carriers.

The second Saturday of May is collection day for the annual National Association of Letter Carriers Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive. This is the 27th year for what has become the nation's largest single-day food drive. The food collected in Marion County will remain here to help local people.

To learn more, we did this question and answer session with Timothy Legge, a letter carrier and the local drive organizer; Karla Grimsley, executive director of Interfaith Emergency Services; and Jessica Nisbett, donor relations director for United Way of Marion County.

TIMOTHY LEGGE

Question: Marion County has long been a national leader in collections for the drive. How do you think this year will compare to past drives?

Answer: Donations locally have been in a downtrend the last few years. The biggest change this year is that Farm Share (Farmshare.org) has stepped up and provided plastic food drive bags for the entire state of Florida. Every resident should be receiving one of these bags in their mailbox before Friday. We are hoping that this serves as another reminder to donate and helps to reverse the trend.

Our carriers and volunteers are ready, and we would like to see a donation in every mailbox this year. Donations can also be dropped off at your local post office.

Q: How many letter carriers will be collecting items Saturday in Marion County?

A: There will be hundreds of Marion County rural and city carriers in 19 offices participating in this year's food drive.

Q: What kinds of food are needed?

A: Lists what type of items can be donated can be found at this website: www.nalc.org/community-service/food-drive/frequently-asked-questions.

Q: Some of the annual postcards announcing the date were distributed last week and some people placed donations on their mailboxes last Saturday. Is the food being stored for addition to the drive on Saturday?

A: Some routes began delivering the cards as early as last Thursday but most residents in Marion County will be receiving them this week. Many residents have already given their donations to their carriers, and we appreciate that. We are getting these donations to Interfaith as we receive them.

KARLA GRIMSLEY

Question: How many agencies will this food go to?

Answer: It goes to all of Interfaith’ s pantries (Ocala, Fellowship, Fort McCoy, Marion Oaks, Dunnellon and Reddick) as well as nine other local agencies and churches countywide, including Brothers Keeper, Salvation Army, His Compassion, St. Theresa’s, Gateway to Hope and the Help Agency of the Forest. Basically, those agencies who come and help that day get to take a portion of the food.

Q: What is the impact of this drive on area families?

A: This drive is the saving grace for the summer months. You have families with children who were getting food at school during the week that now have to come up with more meals and utility bills running high due to the summer heat, so families are stretched. These families will need assistance to make ends meet and without this food drive Interfaith definitely wouldn’t be able to meet the needs of everyone coming to us in the summer months.

Q: What else can people do to help at other times of the year?

A: Volunteer in the pantry; donate money to help us keep lights on and trucks running that pick-up food throughout the year; and ask your church, civic group or neighborhood to hold a food drive. If you collect the food, Interfaith will come and pick it up. Call 629-8868, ext. 212, for a food pick-up and ext. 207 to learn about becoming a volunteer.

Note that this one day of the year our letter carriers go above and beyond the call of duty to help needy families in this county. They are the real heroes of the day. It is a long, back-breaking day for them. Leave a note of encouragement or thanks on your mailbox.

JESSICA NISBETT

Question: How is this drive important to United Way of Marion County programs?

Answer: Many of United Way of Marion County’s internal and funded programs help support families and individuals who take advantage of the generous donations provided through this annual food drive.

Hunger is a major barrier to success for children, adults and seniors in Marion County. Imagine how difficult it must be for a student to focus when their belly is empty, or an adult attempting to be productive when their mind may be focused on where their next meal will come from.

Without this drive, many could go hungry as our local food pantries run low, so it is critical to the overall success of our community to give back and ensure that our neighbors have one of their most basic needs met. Each year, our community does an outstanding job to rally around our most vulnerable and exemplify what it means to Live United.

Q: Will you have volunteers working on the drive?

A: United Way of Marion County supports the drive through public awareness efforts, ensuring that our community is aware of the opportunity to give back through this annual effort and helping to recruit volunteers to pick-up or sort food the day-of.

Q: What are other ways people can help your mission?

"McKenzie Milton back in Hawai'i, taking road to recovery 'one step at a time'","Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. McKenzie Milton

For the first time since suffering a gruesome knee injury putting his decorated collegiate football career on hold, Mililani graduate and UCF quarterback McKenzie Milton is back home in Hawaii on a road to recovery.

Back on November 23rd in Tampa, Milton suffered a dislocated right knee when a South Florida defender collided helmet first into his knee leading to LCL and posterior corner tears along with a severed artery that carries a 50-percent amputation rate.

Miraculously though, after five surgeries including an artery bypass to restore blood flow, the 21 year old is back home in the islands for the first time in a year and going through a demanding rehabilitation process. A journey that led him to taking his first steps without the use of crutches since the injury.

""It felt great man. It's been a long time coming. Slow and grueling process but I just kind of look at it as knocking it down block by block and just taking it one step at a time literally,"" Milton told KHON2 Sports Director Rob DeMello.

“I still dream about playing football again and I’m confident that I’ll get there” - McKenzie Milton // More from the @MililaniTrojans grad & #UCF quarterback on the road to recovery tonight on the @khonnews at 6pm #10hana @hoptraining // https://t.co/9oZimTtTXJ 🤙🏽 pic.twitter.com/oQTOLNPuA6 — Rob DeMello (@RobDeMelloKHON) May 7, 2019

Milton, has been reaching goal after goal thus far in the process of returning from the devastating injury, but possessing the same attitude that led him from state champion QB at Mililani to a two-time AAC player of the year, he is not content.

""As far along as anyone would expect in this process, so, but I'm not comfortable with that. I never try to stay comfortable. I think being an athlete you have to put yourself in uncomfortable situations and relish in those. I'm working to get better every day, if it hurts it's just pain leaving the body so I'm working my butt off to get bs k on the field,"" added Milton.

The injury which took place on national television the day after thanksgiving has been called one of the most gruesome and tough to watch in college football history, but believe it or not, Milton says the pain that comes from rehab outweighs the agony of the injury.

""When they're cranking on the leg trying to get range of motion back it's much more painful than the initial injury, but it's a good pain because you know you're getting better.""

One of the many images that captured the attention around the country was the response from the UCF fans after the injury. Thousands of lei were distributed at the AAC title game and the slogan 10hana was used as inspiration for the team in honor of Milton's jersey number and his Hawaii upbringing. The gesture did not get lost for the proud Hawaii native.

""It's means a lot. I think anybody from Hawaii carries the islands on their shoulder and that aloha spirit, so it means a lot. It's something I don't take for granted and whatever I can do to give back to Hawaii, I'm going to. That's what brought me up, that's what made me who I am and it's something I don't take for granted coming from,"" said Milton.

As for what's next and what the ultimate goal is for Milton as he pushes through the sweat and tears of the demanding rehab process, Milton thinks both long term and shorter.

""Obviously I want to play football again but I just want to be able to run around one day when I have kids and just play in the front yard and throw them passes, play soccer or whatever, I just want to be full functional and healthy at the end of the day, but you know, I still dream about playing football again and I'm confident that I'll get there. I think I'll be playing at a high level again,"" said Milton.

Milton is on track to graduate from UCF in December, majoring in sports and exercise science.

His target to suit up and run out onto the field again is 2020 as a graduate student.",http://www.khon2.com/sports/local-sports/mckenzie-milton-back-in-hawai-i-taking-road-to-recovery-one-step-at-a-time-/1984455133,2019-05-07T04:13:58Z,KHON,"88 Piikoi St, Honolulu, HI 96814, USA"

Pit bull injured after being dragged by pick-up truck in Spring Hill,"Pit bull injured after being dragged by pick-up truck in Spring Hill

Spring Hill, FLA - A young pit bull is recovering after witnesses tell News Chanel 8, someone dragged him from a rope tied the back of a pick-up truck bumper.

It happened at the intersection of Northcliffe Boulevard and Franconia Avenue in Spring Hill.

On Friday morning, the owner of the Nature Coast Animal Wellness and Surgery Center in Weeki Wachess witnessed a horrible scene.

Jan Harwood saw a dog get hurled into the road after he was dragged by a truck doing 30 to 40 miles an hour.

Harwood and a man driving a van, stopped right away, as the pick-up driver drove off. They discovered the pit bull, she named ""Ollie"" with severe road rash all over his body, and the pads of his feet worn off.

She told the van owner, she owned a vet clinic just up the highway. He took the injured pit to the clinic where the Vet did x-rays and ultra-sounds.

He found, Ollie has no broken bones and no internal injuries.

That's quite amazing, considering the traumatic incident he'd just been through.

“He was beating the ground with such velocity and such a high rate of speed, so he was being pulled along and then when the driver of the truck decided to make a turn, luckily when he made that turn, the dog's head slipped out of the collar. It was attached to the rope” said clinic owner, Jan Harwood.

Hernando County deputies are searching for an older, beat up, blue pick-up truck.

It had some furniture in the back.

A pit bull is recovering Saturday morning after being dragged behind a truck in Weeki Wachee, Florida.

Jan Johnson, owner of Nature Coast Animal Wellness & Surgical Center, saw the dog as it was being dragged by a truck down Northcliffe Blvd. on Friday.

""He came loose and flew into the median at which point he was rescued,"" the center writes in a post on Facebook.

A man named Jason who works for Spectrum brought the dog to the center for treatment. Photos posted to Facebook show the horrific injuries the pit bull endured: the dog was covered in scrapes and cuts all over its body from the dragging. Fortunately, veterinarians say the dog had no broken bones, but they are monitoring for internal bleeding.

The center says the dog appears to be about 1 to 2-years-old and had no microchip. He will stay at the center to heal and then put up for adoption.

""Please pray for him and that the person who did this gets caught!""

The truck is described as an older, full-size pickup with faded dark blue paint that appeared to be hauling furniture and junk in the cab. Anyone with information is asked to call the Hernando County Sheriff's Office at 352-754-6830.

"Florida man tortured 2-year-old with torch, airsoft gun while wearing werewolf mask, sheriff says","0 Florida man tortured 2-year-old with torch, airsoft gun while wearing werewolf mask, sheriff says

PENSACOLA, Fla. - A Florida man previously acquitted in the killing of a child was arrested last month and charged with torturing his girlfriend’s 2-year-old daughter, sometimes while wearing a werewolf mask, authorities said.

Andrew Bennett Ross-Celaius, 37, of Pensacola, was arrested April 9 and charged with six counts of aggravated child abuse, four counts of child abuse, a variety of drug charges, possession of a weapon, tampering with evidence and a probation violation, according to the Escambia County Sheriff’s Office. Another man, Eric Everett Furnans, 36, of Pensacola, was arrested Tuesday and charged with destroying evidence in the case after Ross-Celaius was taken into custody. He has since been booked on drug charges.

Eric Everett Furnans Escambia County Sheriff's Office

Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan said Wednesday the evidence Furnans is accused of destroying is cellphones that contained images of the alleged abuse. Investigators believe Furnans acted at the request of Ross-Celaius, who contacted him from jail.

Ross-Celaius is being held without bond, jail records show. Fernans was granted bail of $67,500 but remained in custody Friday morning.

Additional charges against Ross-Celaius are possible, Morgan said. There are suspicions of possible sexual abuse committed against the young victim.

Ross-Celaius apparently tried to kill himself in the Escambia County Jail on Wednesday night, hours after Morgan formally announced the child abuse charges. WEAR-TV reported that sources said the inmate, who was placed in protective custody because of the allegations against him, was found hanging in his cell.

Escambia County officials told the news station Thursday that Ross-Celaius had been hospitalized but was alive. His condition was not made public.

The victim in the current case is not the first toddler Ross-Celaius is accused of harming. According to WKRG in Mobile, Ross-Celaius was charged with murder in the June 24, 2006, death of 2-year-old Kyler Janes after the boy, whose relationship to Ross-Celaius was not immediately known, was hospitalized with bruises all over his body and bleeding in his brain and eyes.

The boy had been seen in the emergency room at Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola five times before for a variety of injuries. Ross-Celaius was tried for the baby’s murder but found not guilty, the news station said.

Editor’s note: The following contains graphic details of alleged child abuse that may be difficult for some readers.

‘Systematic abuse, if not torture’

Morgan said the current allegations against Ross-Celaius began in that same emergency room after the girl’s mother, identified by WEAR-TV as Maranda Lyn Mixson, 27, of Cantonment, took her there April 5 for treatment of what she thought was ringworm.

“When she took the child to the ER, the ER physicians, who are well versed in spotting child abuse, quickly determined that was not any form of ringworm. It was abuse,” Morgan said. “In this case, it was burn marks.”

WEAR-TV reported that hospital staff told deputies the burn marks resembled marks made by an e-cigarette. When Mixson was asked about the marks, she “was very hostile and stated the circle marks were ringworm,” according to an arrest report obtained by the news station.

In addition to the burn marks, Mixson’s daughter had bruises on her stomach, back, arms, elbows, legs and forehead. A large bruise across the girl’s throat appeared to be a rope burn, the station reported.

Mixson was arrested for child neglect but jail records show she was released on $5,000 bond two days later. Sheriff’s Office detectives launched an investigation into the girl’s injuries.

Maranda Lyn Mixson Escambia County Sheriff's Office

Morgan said the alleged abuse by Ross-Celaius was captured on video and stored in the cloud. Some of the recordings may have been shared with other people, the sheriff said.

The sheriff characterized the abuse as “indescribable.”

“It’s the thing nightmares are made of, and no child should ever be subjected to this,” Morgan said.

Chief Deputy Chip Simmons said investigators who went to the child’s home spotted surveillance equipment and cameras, for which they obtained search warrants. What they found was horrifying, he said.

“We found some systematic harassment, if not torture, of a 2-year-old child as this child tried to sleep,” Simmons said.

The chief deputy said video footage showed the child being woken from a sound sleep by having bottles of milk -- some full, some half full -- thrown at her in an overhand fashion. The objects struck the child, waking her and making her cry.

Ross-Celaius was seen in other footage shooting the child with an airsoft gun as she slept, “for no other reason but to wake the child up and to hurt the child,” according to Simmons.

Pictured in a 2013 Street View image is the home on Betty Road in Pensacola, Fla., where authorities allege Andrew Bennett Ross-Celaius, 37, abused and tortured his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter. Google

The girl was also forced to wear a dog training collar, which emits an electric shock to force an animal into submission.

“You can hear the sounds of the dog collar being activated, and then the shrieking and the pain that the child has suffered as a result of this,” Simmons said.

Worse still was footage of Ross-Celaius burning the girl with a small torch, he said.

“I have been in law enforcement for over 30 years, and when I looked at the evidence that we saw here, me and members of my staff were speechless,” Simmons said. “When you look at this, it hits you in the heart and you wonder how anyone can be so mean.”

Morgan said Ross-Celaius tried to achieve a higher level of terror by wearing a werewolf mask as he tortured the girl.

“If you want to think of something you could do to a child to terrorize her, this child lived through that,” the sheriff said.

Simmons said his investigators are still combing through the evidence found on multiple storage drives, reiterating that additional charges against Ross-Celaius were likely.

The chief deputy said, despite the horrors he and other investigators have seen in the case, one thing gives them comfort.

“The only saving grace that I can say is that, at the end of this, at the conclusion of this investigation, we are comforted to some degree by the thought that this precious child will not be harmed tonight,” Simmons said. “Not tonight.”

Brandon Hayley, 28, was arrested Monday on warrants for aggravated battery and armed robbery stemming from a Jan. 24 incident involving a 41-year-old male victim. He also faces two counts of battery that involve incidents that occurred after the tattoo.

The victim, identified as Michael Hart, told investigators that Hayley; Lucian “Luke” Evans, 40; Brett “Wolf” Singleton, 45; and Mary “Beth” Durham, 35, showed up at a home where he was staying.

They allegedly told Hart they were going to cover a gang tattoo on his neck with another one, according to Ocala.com.

Evans and Hayley held him down while Singleton began tattooing the neck.

The man tried to fight off the forced inking until Hayley knocked him unconscious. He woke to find Durham tattooing his neck, while saying, “I’ve never done this before.”

The new tattoo read “Fuck you, Niger,” making it both morally and grammatically reprehensible.

In addition, the old tattoo was still visible under the new one.

But the new tattoo wasn’t meant to be racist, Evans told police when he and Durham were arrested last month.

Evans claimed he and his accomplices were trying to discipline Hart for violating gang rules, according to the Miami Herald.

Hart told police that when he woke up, his phone was missing and “his pants were twisted and his ‘butt’ hurt.”

According to an arrest report obtained by the paper:

(Hart) stated he was wearing blue jeans and felt something wet in his pants. (Hart) stated when he looked at his pants, he saw what he believed to be blood. Michael stated he felt like he’d been sodomized, but could not provide any more details.

Hayley, Evans and Durham remain in the Marion County Jail while Singleton remains at large, according to Ocala.com.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tattoo-misspelled-racial-slur-florida_n_5ccc711ee4b0e4d75732159a,2019-05-03T14:57:58Z,HuffPost,"770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, USA"
No prison time for man who kept teenage girl in sexual captivity for a year,"Advertisement No prison time for man who kept teenage girl in sexual captivity for a year Share Shares Copy Link Copy

A Georgia man has been sentenced to time served for keeping a teenage girl in sexual captivity for more than a year.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports 33-year-old Michael Wysolovski was sentenced to 10 years, with eight months of jail time, after pleading guilty Thursday to first-degree cruelty to children and interstate interference with custody.Wysolovski will receive credit for eight months spent in detention before his trial, meaning his prison time has already been served and probation will account for the remaining nine years and four months of the sentence. He must also register as a sex offender for life.He was arrested in 2017 after law enforcement found a 17-year-old North Carolina girl who’d been missing for over a year in his home in Duluth, a suburb north of Atlanta.The two met in an online forum for anorexia when the girl, who is not being named because she is a sexual assault victim, was 15 and said she was unhappy at home. Wysolovski later convinced the girl to come live with him, picking her up when she was 16 on the side of an interstate near her Charlotte-area home.Georgia’s age of consent is 16, so Wysolovski could not be charged with child molestation.Prosecutor Michael DeTardo said the victim and Wysolovski initially agreed to enter into a sexual relationship in which they simulated non-consensual sex acts. But over time, Wysolovski violated the agreement, using “excessive force” and refusing to recognize “safe words.” DeTardo said Wysolovski also used food to punish the victim, who was anorexic, or forced her to perform sex acts.The newspaper reports that DeTardo said the relationship was a “gray area” of consent that would be risky to bring before a jury. Rape and aggravated sodomy charges were dropped in the plea deal, and the victim’s family and DeTardo prioritized a requirement for Wysolovski to register as a sex offender.Wysolovski told the court he believed he was helping the victim escape a bad home life.Police located the girl after she contacted another person on an anorexia forum who contacted the FBI.During a victim impact statement Thursday, the girl’s father said she was found malnourished, with ringworm and suffering from back problems because she had been repeatedly held in a dog cage.Holding a stuffed animal and speaking in a soft voice, the victim told the court: “The psychological damage Michael Wysolovski inflicted is beyond imagination.”",https://www.wpbf.com/article/no-prison-time-for-man-who-kept-teenage-girl-in-sexual-captivity-for-a-year/27355124,2019-05-03T14:50:00Z,WPBF-TV,"Northcorp Business Park, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, USA"
"Deputies: Florida man used werewolf mask, shock collar to abuse 2-year-old child","ESCAMBIA COUNTY, Fla. (WKRG) --A man is behind bars after deputies say he used multiple ways of torture to abuse a 2-year-old.

The Escambia County Sheriff's Office says the girl's mother brought her to the hospital with the suspicion of ringworm. Deputies say the ER doctors immediately determined the ring marks on the child were burn marks.

Andrew Ross Celaius, 37, was arrested and has been charged with aggravated child abuse and tampering of evidence.

""It's the thing nightmares are made of and no child should ever be subjected to this,"" Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan said.

After searching the home, the sheriff's office found a substantial amount of video and photo evidence of abuse taken on home surveillance and cellphone video.

The sheriff's office says video showed Ross Celaius throwing water bottles at the child to wake her up. Investigators say he would also use a lighter to burn the child. Video also shows Celaius shooting the child with an airsoft gun in order to wake her up.

Video showed him wearing a werewolf mask during the abuse.

The sheriff's office says the most disturbing video shows the child wearing a dog shock collar. They said you could hear the child shrieking whenever the shock collar was triggered.

""There's no words to describe why someone would hurt and intentionally damage and harrass someone..just trying to sleep. It's a terrible thing to see,"" Chief Deputy Chip Simmons said.

Deputies say another man, Eric Furnans, 36, was arrested in connection to the case, where he will be charged with tampering of evidence. The sheriff's office says Ross Celaius called Furnans from jail asking him to destroy cellphones.

The sheriff's office says the mother of the 2-year-old was arrested and charged with neglect. She has bonded out. The sheriff's office says they believe she was unaware of the abuse. She is fully cooperating with the investigation.

The sheriff's office says they're continuing to search through the video evidence. There is a possibility of additional charges for Ross Celaius. Deputies also continue to investigate the possibility of sexual abuse towards the 2-year-old.

Ross Celaius has a criminal history, including a 2006 case where he was charged in the homicide of a 2-year-old. He was acquitted in that case.

Kirsten Bucey leads the Child Protection Team at the Gulf Coast Kid's House and they have a partnership with law enforcement in these types of cases.

""We have specially trained pediatricians and nurse practitioners who are trained to diagnose abuse and neglect and determine if injuries are consistent with accidents or if they're inflicted,"" Bucey said. ""I think the community would be surprised at the amount of egregious abuse we see right here in Escambia County.""

Orlando carjacking suspect arrested after taking trooper's cruiser,"- The Florida Highway Patrol says a 22-year-old man stole a cruiser from a trooper who’d stopped to help him and led law enforcement officials on an 11-mile (17-kilometer) pursuit.

An incident report says the trooper spotted a “medically distressed” man on the side of Florida’s Turnpike Thursday afternoon. When the trooper went to get water for him, Shane Jensen jumped into the patrol car and sped away.

As Jensen drove north, Osceola County sheriff’s deputies deployed stop sticks. Jenson avoided them but eventually stopped and ran into the woods. He was arrested a short time later.

Authorities say Jensen carjacked a teenager in Clearwater on Wednesday. In addition to those charges, he’s now facing charges of stealing a patrol car and reckless driving.

Authorities: Florida man used shock collar to torture 2-year-old girl,"Pictures and videos were found of the man intentionally burning the young girl with a lighter, among other egregious acts.

An Escambia County man was arrested Wednesday under suspicion of using multiple methods of torture to abuse a 2-year-old girl, according to the Escambia County Sheriff’s Office.

Andrew Bennett Ross Celaius, 37, faces multiple charges of aggravated child abuse, child abuse, tampering with evidence and several drug-related charges.

Authorities were alerted about possible abuse by doctors who identified burn marks around the girl’s neck. The toddler was taken to the hospital by her mother, who claimed her daughter had ringworm, the sheriff’s office said.

Investigators searched Celaius’ home and found videos and pictures of Celaius intentionally burning the young girl with a lighter, shooting her with an airsoft gun, hitting her with a bottle and scaring her with a werewolf mask.

However, it was a video displaying Celaius harming the girl with a shock collar — described as a tazing collar for dogs, that deputies found as most egregious, according to deputies.

Investigators also found videos of torture on cloud storage, and they are still looking into what the videos may have been used for.

The mother was also arrested for neglect, but was bonded out of jail. Deputies believe she was unaware of the extent of the abuse. She is fully cooperating with the investigation, according to deputies.",https://www.theledger.com/news/20190503/authorities-florida-man-used-shock-collar-to-torture-2-year-old-girl?rssfeed=true,2019-05-03T08:15:40Z,The Ledger,"300 W Lime St, Lakeland, FL 33815, USA"
